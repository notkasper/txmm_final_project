Cloud expansion and improved margin trends, expected to take shape during the second quarter, will be catalysts for the stock, the analysts said.\n\nBesides singling out Amazon (ticker: AMZN) as a top pick, the Baird team is generally bullish on platform technology companies such as Alibaba Group Holding (BABA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), urging investors: “Don’t bet against the internet!”\n\nEven after all of the advancements in technology that defined the “bustling” 2010s, Baird analysts predict that the next decade will see a “bounty of meaningful technology transitions,” including quantum computing, artificial general intelligence, and the rollout of 6G. (Yes, you read that right—the 5G dream is barely realized and talk has already started on 6G.)\n\nTo be sure, there are headwinds for some of this tech exuberance.\n\nBig tech has come under the scrutiny of lawmakers due to antitrust concerns and fears over how users’ data is used. Politicians are expected to ramp up their attacks during the 2020 election cycle, but Baird analysts dismiss that as “posturing.” The real risk to tech players won’t be forced breakups but management distraction and inaction spurred by the noise. A slowdown in innovation and M&amp;A is possible, they say.\n\nAs for what will drive growth for Amazon and other tech companies, Baird sees several opportunities over the coming decade:\n\n• Networking speeds will increase, boosting efficiencies. Some of the largest platform companies may begin building their own chips and processors.\n\n• There will be new user interfaces as the capabilities of augmented and virtual reality increase, potentially leading to new ways to access e-commerce and online media.\n\n• Media subscription models will continue to dominate, but there may not be much room for many more players in the space.\n\n• “Connected everything,” which means our cars and homes may be an extension of today’s connected devices.\n\n• Cloud wars will continue, providing a huge opportunity for Amazon, Alphabet’s Google, Alibaba, and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n• E-commerce will be everywhere, and digital-payment options will increase.\n\nSource: Barron's",

Who thought that was a marketable object?!?!?!  Also, kids today just aren’t that into Toy Story, kids from the 90s were. Kids from the 90s have kids today who wanna see spiderman. \n\nIt just so happens Disney will have 3 Avengers lands by 2023: California, Paris, and Hong Kong.   I think those parks will crush Star Wars land numbers.  People will also be getting over Harry Potter Land, meaning Disney will be poaching those $$ from those who would’ve had to choose between parks.  \n\nWe’re pretty much guaranteed to have a new original disney character/movie in the next 5 years that will capture the planet.  \n\nWhat do ya’ll think?",

([https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/anbr7e/first\\_year\\_into\\_stocks\\_summary\\_all\\_tech/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/anbr7e/first_year_into_stocks_summary_all_tech/)). I still follow buy and hold strategy and only sell stocks when I don't like certain changes in a company. Sometimes those decisions paid off, sometimes (AAPL) I missed out a bit (nevertheless I don't regret those decisions). \n\nAt some point I was down 30-50% on both NVDA and TSLA, I do strongly believe in both those companies and will not sell either of them in the next 5y for sure. Hitting a bigger number on the portfolio I started diversifying a bit as well. (MA,V,MRK)\n\nStrategy for 2020 is pretty simple for me, I'll invest mostly in AI and cybersececurity companies: First priority is to add a ton of Tencent. Highly recommend the book: \"AI Superpowers Book by Kai-Fu Lee\". imo there is no way around AI and probably Asia will be in the driving seat for the first time in 5-10y.\n\n**Be patient, don't panic sell, it might be swingy here and there but if you invest in strong companies it will pay off.** \n\nCurrent portfolio:\n\n* TSLA +56%\n* CRM +46%\n* FTNT +37%\n* MSFT +35%\n* AMZN +31%\n* MRK +9%\n* MA + 9%\n* NNND +8%\n* NVDA +7%\n* V +1%\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/6RJNKXU](https://imgur.com/a/6RJNKXU)",

      "selftext": " Think about when railroads were being built across America. When that happened, railroad stocks did really well, but you know what did better?  Iron ore. That’s because iron ore was required to make the steel for all the rails. Even people like Rockefeller bought out iron ore mines as a way to profit from that trend. Or imagine if you’d owned oil stocks back in 1895 when gasoline was invented and patented. A massive new market opened up for this commodity. So when you get this leading edge of really big trends unfolding, there’s always a commodities implication. Everything that we use on Earth is grown or dug up from the ground. So there’s always something that benefits from these big-picture trends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there are a few different aspects to the 5G revolution. And they touch on different technologies that are involved and the corresponding commodities. To put it most simply, there is a lot of fiber optic cable that’s involved. 5G thrives on fiber optics to transmit the signal. So there’s a whole network across America and across the world of new fiber optic cable that needs to be laid. Now, most people are aware of that. But what we don’t think about as much is that the cable that’s required for 5G is different than the cable we’ve used in the past.\n\n \n\nWell, the specific metal that I’m talking about in regard to 5G fiber optics is called erbium. Most people haven’t heard of erbium, but it’s actually part of a larger group of metals that many investors also aren’t familiar with. I’m talking about rare earth metals. So rare earth metals became prominent almost a decade ago, when China suddenly cut off exports… and some of the prices for rare earth metals like promethium rocketed 1,000% *in a matter of months*. Share prices of rare earth companies went up 10,000% in some cases. That type of gain is hard to wrap your head around. But for perspective, that means a $100 investment would have turned into $10,000. $1,000 would have turned into $100,000… And a $10,000 investment would have made you a millionaire. Another way to think about it is that shareholders in tiny rare earth stocks made more in a few months than Apple shareholders made in the prior 16 years of Apple gains – combined. It was a crazy time… and now we have a shot for similar gains by betting on the right rare earth companies. Things haven’t really even started picking up big time, and my subscribers are already up over 53% on one of my rare earth elements picks… and up nearly 150% on the other. And that’s in less than two months.",

If you do think a stock is going to dip, and you want to hold money to buy in at a lower point, but you don't want cash to just sit there, is it smart to put that money into something really liquid like SPY and when the time comes, sell off some of SPY to buy the stock when it dips?\n\nI think my understanding on the first point is right, but a family member asked me about the second question earlier today and I wasn't 100% sure so I wanted to check to make sure I'm on the right track!",

Nasdaq 100 is dominated by tech companies accounting for *54%* of the index\\[[Tech importance in NASDAQ 100](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq100.asp)\\].    This 54% does not include companies like Amazon which is generally    regarded as tech but is considered otherwise in financial circles.    Nasdaq 100 aligns well with my portfolio since my portfolio is tech    heavy too.\n5. **NYSE**: The NYSE Composite (*$NYA*) is a stock market index covering all common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange\\[[NYSE Composite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NYSE_Composite)\\]. I used this as a proxy for the stocks in *NYSE*.

An argument can be made whether this is the best performing tech ETF.    With the gift of hindsight, clearly it is not.

Those who received a classical education in the domain might know about the works of Schumpeter and Kondratieff whose described economic cycles in works that have made history in economic science.\n\nEveryday that goes by the description of those cycles match a little bit more our current economy. We are currently (or just where) in a prosperity period where innovation drive competitivity and investment, the economic activities reach their maximum heights and the idle or unemployed resources are minimised. As we can see our markets reached historical heights that some starts to call \"pre-crisis\" levels and unemployment follow suit.\n\nInnovation products displace the old ones and thus decrease their demand in the market. Consequently, the prices of old products fall. With a view to liquidating their stocks, the old firms start selling their goods at a low price and hence most of the firms incur losses and some firms are even forced to run into loss. Schumpeter describes the industry as being the source and first warning indicator of a crisis, this description can be seen today in current PMI index.\n\nThe events that follows are Investment declines and unemployment rise, leading to a fall in the aggregate demand. As the entrepreneurs start repaying bank loans, the quantity of money in circulation is reduced and prices start falling. Profits too decline and come to zero point. Uncertainty and risk increase. A wave of pessimism sweeps the entire economy and the boom period ends with the appearance of the phase of depression.\n\nThis phase appears to be the next step for us,  this would mean the current market trend is only induced by FOMO and confidence boosted by the fed rates.\nPS: sorry if there is grammar or syntax errors, english is not my first language but feel free to suggest improvments !",

      "selftext": "\nIt might be a crowded trade, but the stock is still cheap, relative to the online retailer’s free cash flow.\n\n“Buy Amazon” isn’t the world’s biggest stock-picking cliché, but it’s close. There are 49 analysts who cover the shares, and 47 of them are positive, with two neutral, according to FactSet. Only Alibaba Group Holding of China and ICICI Bank of India boast more endorsements.\n\nAnd after a record-setting run-up, Amazon’s stock isn’t obviously inviting. A $1,000 stake at the close of the stock’s first day of trading in 1997 has turned into more than $950,000. The shares today, at $1,875, go for 69 times projected 2020 earnings.\n\nStill, buy Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN). The stock price looks sensible when compared with free cash flow, which is swelling quickly. Some growth initiatives are only now paying off. Don’t expect a 35% gain this year, as Amazon has averaged, compounded, since going public. But don’t rule it out, either.\n\nAmazon’s reputation for operating near break-even has long been outdated. Founder Jeff Bezos has emphasized free cash flow over accounting earnings from the start, and Amazon has generated free cash since 2002. The company has tended to invest much of that cash for growth, and the result is that earnings have been positive only since 2014, and only meaningfully so since 2018. Now the numbers are reaching escape velocity.\n\nWhen 2019’s results are released, Wall Street expects Amazon to report that revenue increased by 20%, to $279.1 billion; that earnings rose slightly, to $10.4 billion; and that free cash flow ballooned by 28%, to $24.9 billion. In 2020, free cash flow is expected to expand even faster, by 36%, to $34 billion.\n\nWithin five years, the consensus view is that Amazon will become the biggest free cash generator in America, passing some companies that aren’t exactly standing still, like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). The simplest reason is that Amazon’s investment spending can’t keep up with its growth rate forever.\n\nAmazon launched Prime in 2005, with its free two-day shipping for members, and vast opportunities for the company to put capital to work building speedier infrastructure. Not long after, Amazon Web Services went into cloud computing, another path for investment. Both ventures have proved to be lucrative, with Prime spurring increased spending by shoppers, and AWS yielding generous profit margins.\n\nLast year, Amazon said that it would spend to shorten free Prime shipping to a single day. There are early signs of that paying off, too. Cowen analyst John Blackledge estimates that Prime membership grew 13% during the fourth quarter, versus a year earlier. That compares with 3% growth a year ago and would be the third straight quarter of acceleration.\n\nNow, consider another of Amazon’s growth initiatives: advertising. A recent search for “men’s tennis rackets” on Amazon.com yielded editorial recommendations and a racket listing labeled “Amazon’s Choice.” But nothing was more prominently displayed than the three sponsored racket listings near the top—except for the paid ad for portable nets just above them.\n\nAdvertising doesn’t require vast investments in fleets and data farms, and it looks like another boon for Amazon’s growth. Ad revenue will rise 36%, to $17.6 billion, in 2020, and by 2025 will top $46 billion, predicts Cowen’s Blackledge. Assuming a 35% operating margin for the business, he estimates that advertising and AWS will together account for 90% of operating income this year.\n\nThat has important implications for shareholders. First, it bodes well for the competitiveness of a store when it doesn’t have to rely on its retail margins for the bulk of profits. Second, the advertising ramp provides another rich source of funds to invest in growth. Third, with Amazon passing the anniversary of its spending boost for Prime one-day, it is unclear that it will need that extra spending. As things stand, growth in capital expenditures is expected to decelerate from over 25% last year, to 16% this year, to under 10% in 2021.\n\nAmong 10 analysts who have estimated Amazon’s free cash flow out to 2021, the lowest says $32.7 billion, the highest says $57.5 billion, and the average is $43.7 billion. Out to 2024, there are only three estimates, averaging $82.8 billion. Apple, in comparison, is expected to produce close to $63 billion in free cash during its current fiscal year through September.\n\nIf distant estimates for Amazon are feasible, or even if they are only moderately overblown, the stock could continue outperforming. At less than 30 times estimated 2020 free cash flow, it is cheaper than the shares of Visa (V), Nike (NKE), or McDonald’s (MCD). From here, 20% annual gains for the next three years could leave the stock priced at a humbler 25 times free cash flow.\n\nA government crackdown against powerful tech titans is a risk, but Amazon may have a better “who me?” defense than some of the others. Its market share in the public cloud is less than half, and falling, as Microsoft and others catch up. In e-commerce, more than half of its sales are from third-party merchants who pay to use its services. And in online advertising, it’s a pipsqueak next to Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).\n\nAll told, Amazon is popular with stockpickers for good reason. It’s not too late to join the crowd.\n\nSource: Barron's",

      "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 6th, 2020.\n\n# **Geopolitical tensions could hold back stocks in the week ahead, as investors await jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/03/geopolitical-tensions-could-hold-back-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Geopolitical concerns could continue to weigh on stocks in the week ahead, leaving investors wondering whether Middle East tensions will be the catalyst for a much anticipated market pullback.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks sold off Friday, the second trading day of the year, after a rally to new highs on Thursday. The market was slammed after the U.S. killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, sparking a rally in oil prices and raising concerns Iran will take some retaliatory action.\n*****\n&gt; The big event in the coming week is the December employment report, expected to show 160,000 payrolls were added and average earnings rose 3.1% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. The jobs report is especially important after December’s ISM manufacturing data Friday was surprisingly negative and the weakest in more than a decade.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the four-day week at 3,235, with a loss of 0.2%, after Friday’s 0.7% decline. Treasury yields retreated on Friday, as buyers moved into the safety of bonds and the 10-year yield was at 1.78%.\n*****\n&gt; “This was a textbook rationale for a bout of profit taking, but that said, I don’t think it’s dramatic,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Nonetheless, the question will be when do buyers come in ... Much will depend on this weekend and next week in terms of headlines from both the White House and Iran.”\n*****\n&gt; Some analysts have been looking for a minor selloff in stocks after the fourth quarter’s 8.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500. But whether Friday’s decline is the start of something bigger is unclear.\n*****\n&gt; “It could be, but only in retrospect will you know for sure,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said if Iran takes some minor action, the market could shrug it off, oil could lose its gains, and stocks could move higher again.\n*****\n&gt; “We may see Treasurys continue to get a big bid, gold get a bid and the safe-haven currencies get a bid. If we go into things next week and all things are quiet, the market will pay attention to the data,” Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities, expects to see Treasury yields lower initially. “I think short-term, the geopolitical risk is probably going to override any fundamental views that people have of the marketplace,” he said.\n*****\n&gt; But there could be a catalyst for some Treasury selling with the issuance of high level of corporate bonds in the coming week. Faranello expects the year to start off strong, with corporate treasurers looking to raise about $30 billion to $35 billion in the debt market.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they will be looking closely at the jobs data after Friday’s surprisingly weak manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management, which was expected to have been better because of the trade agreement.\n*****\n&gt; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said the survey actually took place before the trade deal was announced, and he’s waiting for the results of the next couple of reports.\n*****\n&gt; He expects to see 165,000 jobs added in December, off of 266,000 in November, which was in part skewed by the end of GM’s strike. “I think there’s a little upside risk. It seems like we saw a pretty strong Christmas season,” he said, adding there could have been more hiring than was factored into seasonal adjustments.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aoDnUW7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6x4NtiW.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/I3ZNEuH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QqYTbUD.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3Ltxt2.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CyHtJoF.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RO92K5i.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SEszd5M.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Trp0mo0.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tlPjW9c.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aicevVU.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical January Trading: Volatile Last 20 Years\n\n&gt; Yesterday major indexes continued their recent trend of strength on the first trading day of 2020. While today the market has turned weaker on escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. This type of volatility was once quite rare in January. However since 2000, the S&amp;P 500 has declined ten times in twenty years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the eighth trading day. Greatest weakness has appeared just after mid-month, the eleventh trading day. Mild average losses on or around the eleventh trading day quickly swell to over 2% for DJIA and nearly as much for S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82a79e9eb21df6d414fd0ec1c7725b4d/e48bbc4e7f5b7041-e9/s500x750/6a964dc4a15e1c9ab0fcc9ccc451f6e642aacff5.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Banner Year for US Equities\n\n&gt; 2019 was surely a banner year for US equities. With a total return of 31.5%, the S&amp;P 500's gain in 2019 was nearly three times the historical average 12-month return of 11.7%. That's strong! In the chart below we compare the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to its average annualized returns over those same time frames since 1928. While the one-year return sticks out like a sore thumb, we would note that the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last two, three, and ten years are also above average. Almost as notable as the fact that the one year return has been so much stronger than average is that the S&amp;P 500's two-year return is less than two percentage points above its historical average. That just shows how bad 2018 was! Looking further out, the only time frame where returns are below average is over the last twenty years where the 6.1% annualized gain is almost five percentage points below the historical average. Over a full twenty years, that's a difference of tripling your investment versus making eight times your investment!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below compares how current returns during the above time frames rank on a percentile basis relative to all other periods. The S&amp;P 500's one-year return ranks in the 85th percentile which is pretty extreme. For the two, five, and ten year periods, though, current returns are much more middle of the road. Conversely, as stretched as extreme to the upside that the one-year return is relative to all other periods, the twenty-year return is even more depressed to the downside. At just 4.6, more than 95% of all other 20-year periods have been better than the last 20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile.png))**\n\n&gt; Finally, as mentioned above the last year has certainly been a strong one, and it follows a year where returns had been abnormally poor. The chart below shows the rolling 12-month total return for the S&amp;P 500 going back to 1990. The gain of 31.49% over the last year was the strongest for the S&amp;P 500 in six years coming up just shy of the 32.39% gain in 2013. Last year at this time, though, the S&amp;P 500 was down over 4% on a total return basis in the prior 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile-rolling.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 2019 and 2020 Dogs of the Dow\n\n&gt; The Dogs of the Dow strategy is a simple, hands-off investment approach that says to buy the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow 30 at the start of each year. With the calendar turning over from 2019 to 2020, below is a look at how the Dogs strategy performed in 2019. As shown, the 10 Dogs posted a total return of 19.38% in 2019, which was below the 25% return for the Dow and well below the 28% that the 20 non-Dogs returned. The biggest winner in the Dogs in 2019 was JP Morgan (JPM) with a gain of 47.27%, but Pfizer's (PFE) decline of 6.92% really hurt overall performance.\n\n&gt; The 20 non-Dogs were led by Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V), and United Tech (UTX), while Walgreens Boots (WBA) and 3M (MMM) were the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019.

Eight of the ten Dogs from 2019 remain on the list, while 3M (MMM) and Walgreens Boots (WBA) -- the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019 -- have replaced JP Morgan (JPM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) -- the two biggest gainers of the Dogs in 2019. Dow Inc. (DOW) is the highest yielding Dog at 5.12%, followed by Exxon (XOM), IBM, and Verizon (VZ), which all have dividend yields above 4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Full Year 2019, Q4, and December Asset Class Total Returns\n\n&gt; Below are the final total return performance numbers for key ETFs across asset classes in 2019. For each ETF, we also include its performance in Q4 and December.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied 2.9% in December and 8.99% in Q4 to finish the full year up 31.22%. The Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) was by far the best performing US index ETF in 2019 with a gain of 38.96%, and it was the third best ETF in the entire matrix. The title of best performing ETF in 2019 goes to the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector ETF (XLK), which rallied 49.86%. Remember, 40% of XLK is made up of just Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which gained 89% and 58% in 2019, respectively. The Russia stock market ETF (RSX) was the second biggest winner in the matrix with a 2019 total return of 40.79%.\n\n&gt; Everywhere you look across the equity landscape, there were big winners in 2019, but the weakest area of the market was the Energy sector ETF (XLE). Even still, XLE managed to put up double-digit percentage gains on the year at +11.74%.\n\n&gt; In the commodities space, we saw oil gain 32.61% in 2019, which actually bested the gain for the S&amp;P 500. Gold (GLD) and silver (SLV) both put in solid gains in the mid-teens, while the perpetually losing natural gas ETF (UNG) was the only ticker in the matrix that fell across all three time frames (December, Q4, and full year).\n\n&gt; Looking at fixed income, the aggregate bond market ETFs (AGG and BND) posted total returns of 8%+, while the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) gained 14% on the year. Q4 and December were tough for fixed income, however, as rates moved higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/assetclass1231.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Almanac: Average Performance Slips in Presidential Election Years\n\n&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations typically propels stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&amp;P 500 and sixth for DJIA since 1950. It is the end of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.\n\n&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. Last year, January was downright stellar after the worst December since 1931 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; In election years, Januarys have been weaker. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 slip to number #8 while DJIA average performance dips negative. NASDAQ slips to #3, but average performance remains respectable at 1.7%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/891a38b2171ab08b547127db29f12536/f4d2c822df56176c-4f/s400x600/8f8fe64b2da5c123c7e073095dd8b656e1066429.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 3rd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.5.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$WBA** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$CALM** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$ANGO** \n&gt; * **$AZZ** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$UNF** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$SCHN** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$KRUS** \n&gt; * **$FC** \n&gt; * **$SLP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Trp0mo0.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lNG07hG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/Y1KO0R4.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DNOQOhD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.7.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QorVd8K.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xTrYEcQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.8.2 0Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TRPytQz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/owUNbSh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RXUjAgC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/m5AQPKl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/v60Cw2n.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.10.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $229.38\n&gt; **lululemon athletica inc.

      "selftext": "While there was little news from large cap names this week, President Trump managed to keep things interesting with his New Years eve tweet that he expected to sign a Phase 1 trade agreement with China in the next couple of weeks. That sent Chinese stocks, along with US companies that import and use Chinese products, higher on Thursday. Then on Friday, oil and defense stocks, along with gold, received a boost (for the want of a better word) from the US airstrike that killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani. Airline stocks fell as oil reached a seven month high.\n\nIn Japan, Carlos Ghosn, the 5 foot 6 inch ex CEO of Renault and Nissan who was facing charges of financial misconduct charges, provided a great story that seems more appropriate for Hollywood than Wall Street. Despite being held under strict bail conditions including constant surveillance, Mr Ghosn apparently climbed into a case for musical instruments on Sunday evening before being whisked off to a local Japanese airport and flown to Turkey and then on to the Lebanon.\n\nBack home, Barron’s ran a worrying story about **Canada Goose’s** ($GOOS) $1,000 signature parkas and how they are stuffed with goose down and trimmed with coyote fur. That’s a dangerous product to be associated with in the age of the anti-fur movement and social media. The Daily Beast has already run a story claiming that owning a Canada Goose parka may even put off potential dating partners. Canada Goose’s stock price has fallen 50% from 2018 highs and its valuation at 35x earnings would normally be reasonable for a company growing at around 30% p.a. However the risk of being outed for the use of fur in the fickle fashion industry means I would avoid.\n\n**Cassave Science Inc’s** ($SAVA) stock price almost doubled after CEO Remi Barbier bought 100,000 of stock on New Years eve. The purchase follows positive data from a mid stage trial for one of its experimental Alzheimer’s disease drugs. There is still a way to go before approval, meaning the stock may yet have to give up all the recent gains (and more), but with a market cap of just $166 million the potential upside from an approved Alzheimer’s drug would be huge. The purchase by the CEO is a big vote of confidence from those in the know and sends out a strong signal to the market.\n\nOn Monday, **Sol-Gel** ($SLGL) jumped 90% after reporting positive phase 3 trial results for its acne treatment drug Twyneo. Sol-Gel now plans to file a new drug application (NDA) in the second half of 2020. It is more good news for the company which was already planning to file an NDA for its rosacea drug Epsolay and potentially going from zero to two commercial stage drugs in one year. The company’s valuation has jumped to $320 million, but that looks reasonable given its two drugs that are close to approval with a combined total addressable market of $10 billion.\n\nOtherwise the news was largely confined to analyst upgrades and downgrades. A couple that caught my eye were Goodyear Tire and Axsome Therapeutics.\n\n**Goodyear Tire** ($GT) is a cyclical stock that will never trade at a premium but with the stock down 55% over the past two years and trading on 7x 2020 consensus earnings its valuation is looking cheap. Nomura Instinet analyst Anindya Das agrees with a target price 33% above Fridays close. Das says GT has a strong earnings outlook having largely completed its restructuring. I would agree, auto sales have slumped since 2015 but, with the average auto age at an all time high of 12 years (and in the absence of a recession), it’s likely that the renewal cycle will begin in the near term. GT’s forward PE looks cheap compared to peers such as Cooper Tires (10x 2020 earnings). The 4.2% dividend also looks attractive.\n\n**Axsome's** ($AXSM) was up on Monday after reporting positive results from a late-stage study to evaluate, AXS-07, its drug for the acute treatment of migraine. Good news for Axsome and 37 million Americans suffer from migraine. Axsome said it plans to file an NDA in the second half of 2020.\n\nIt follows news earlier in December regarding Axsome’s new clinical drug the blockbuster, AXS-05, which reported significant improvements in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). 47% of patients with MDD achieve complete remission, as opposed to the 16% of patients taking the placebo. Depression treatments are one of the largest healthcare markets in the U.S., with around 7.1% of adults -- or 17.3 million -- Americans affected each year. Estimated at USD 15.60 Billion in 2018. And there's not a lot of competition.\n\nAxsome's stock has surged by almost 4,000% since the beginning of 2019, pushing the stock from a $93 million market cap into the $3.5 billion range. But it could have further upside potential due to AXS-05 and AXS-05 and the large addressable market. Priced at $95.20 at Fridays close Cantor Fitzgerald raised their price target to $125 and HC Wainwright increased theirs from $170 to $200.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Follow\" me if you would like to receive updates during the week.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.

Google already has a partnership with Fitbit with its health analytics , and Fitbit partners with Google Cloud to house its data. \n\nSo, why wouldn’t a simple opt in/opt out alleviate these privacy concerns (like GDPR) and collapse the spread, causing the stock to rise closer to $7.35? \n\nThe background on the merger is worth a read [Fitbit merger proxy ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1447599/000162828019015006/fitbitdefinitiveproxy.htm). Google and Fitbit will exercise their best efforts to get the deal done, and there was a very active second bidder here (rumoured to be Facebook, which would arguably face the same scrutiny). \n\nGoogle was also Investigated for its recent acquisition of Looker , and that was approved a few months after (frankly, any mega tech/internet mergers will be investigated in detail). Perhaps this one is no different ?\n\nWould love to read any opposing (or agreeing) thoughts here. \n\nI currently don’t have a position in $FIT",

I know there is a lot of reports of Dish not trying to build out it's spectrum and just sit on it to sell it but I can say the fulfillment company I work for has actively been a part of the build out. I have personally been to cell phone towers participating in the build out. I do think at this moment Dish has pulled back a little bit on the build out compared to last year waiting to see how the T-Mobile Sprint merger goes, as Dish is set to acquire Boost mobile along with more spectrum and become the 4th mobile provider, but I do believe that they are waiting to officially acquire the new spectrum before they continue any more build out along. Dish is in a unique position of all the carriers by not having an existing network in place, they can go all in on 5g and do not have to divide their spectrum covering older 4g, 3g, and 2g devices.\n\nI am reading a lot of mixed reports of the T-Mobile Sprint merger though. Some say it looks like it will likely go through, while other reports say it is 50/50. I personally think it will go through. Dish's internal communication throughout the company and the fulfillment partners seems to be very positive for the future. I also think Dish's stock isn't reflective of all of the current projects that they have going on. Last quarter was the first subscriber gain in years and the stock didn't move like I thought it would. On top of the subscriber gain, Dish has officially partnered with Google, building the Google Assistant into our remotes and UI of the Hopper set top box and even allowing integration of Nest into the Hopper such as setting the Nest thermostat from the voice remote, or when the Nest Hello Doorbell is rang it shows up as a notification on the screen of the Hopper. Dish has also began shifting focus of the technician job position from being just a satellite technician to being an all around electronic technician with partnerships with Samsung (doing fulfillment work such as repairing appliances), Amazon (doing basic A/V work like hanging tvs and setting up soundbars etc purchased thru Amazon, along with Ring product installs), and as mentioned above, Google (all techs are official Nest Pro installers, and offer Nest products to every customer). \n\nThrough these partnerships Dish has spun off another brand that started in November, OnTech, where the technicians do fulfillment work for pretty much any company that wants a skilled technician that is part of a JD Power customer service award company to do their labor. Most of the partnerships above have been branded as OnTech going forward, and they are actively pursuing all sorts of other partnerships for fulfillment work going forward, with a road map for this year that includes adding more partners that need technicians for tech product installs such as big box stores like Lowes, Bed Bath and Beyond, and even insurance and mortgage companies looking to offer smart home devices and security systems to lower their risks such as Quicken Loans. Customers can also go directly to OnTechs site and purchase products from select partners and schedule appointments. I haven't found too much press on this venture for Dish and think it isn't being reflected in the stock prices. We have heard there will be a big advertisement push in the Spring to increase awareness for this, but this brand is live now. \n\nSprint looks like a good buy to me, as under the terms of the merger, Sprint shareholders would receive 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile for every share of Sprint. With T-Mobile currently trading at about $78, that implies a merger price of $8 for Sprint. But Sprint is trading at $5.18, a 35% discount to the implied merger price if the deal is approved. \n\nI am kind of new to stocks and would like some opinions on this. I currently have a little invested in Dish because I do believe they are trying to adapt to the streaming TV landscape and are planning on dominating the DIFY (do it for you) landscape. \n\nMy questions are: \n\nDo you guys think the T-Mobile Sprint merger will pass? And do you anticipate the ruling to go quickly or be drawn out in the courts?\n\nDo you feel like Dish's stock is currently not pricing in their other ventures and partnerships as they transition from being a satellite/cable provider into more of a tech labor force and 5g provider? Also, assuming the merger goes thru, will the Boost acquisition and additional spectrum drive Dish's stock up alot?\n\nIs Sprint a good buy considering there it is a 35% discount to the merger price?\n\nIs T-Mobile a good buy assuming the merger goes thru even with John Legere leaving?",

      "selftext": "I've read a few times that some people anticipate Boeing's price to drop after it's 2019 fourth quarter earning report (end of January). They cite the same issues related to the 737s. My question is, don't the expectations for the next ER already price in the 737 issues? We can fairly well estimate how much revenue and profit was lost due to the 737s, the backlog, the slowing production, the compensation payouts to airlines, and the expenses related to preparation for further payouts and litigation. Isn't the expectation now for the next ER already that Boeing will be down significantly compared to last year? None of this is news. Assuming the ER is closely aligned with these expectations, why would the price drop upon the ER release confirming such? Sometimes individual investors panic when seeing what they already knew to be true generally printed in the ER, but this would be brief at most, and institutions probably wouldn't be phased.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe know the ER will be pretty bad generally, but it'll likely match expectations. I think there's little reason to think the expectations will be off. If they are, they could just easily go the other way - that is, maybe the ER isn't quite as bad as we anticipate, in which case the price might even rise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I misunderstanding anything here?",

Currently, I'm looking at these few stocks for the following reasons. \n\n1. Tesla - Tesla had just successfully ramped its Model 3 production in the US to achieve 86,000+ units in Q4. It has achieved record delivery numbers quarter after quarter since Q3 2018 (with exception to Q1 2019). Now with a new factory completed tooled up for 2020, am expecting further increase in productions and delivery numbers if economic conditions stays the same. Estimating the stock to surpass $500 before the end of the year. Thou, the buy in may be a bit too high right now.  \n2. Disney - I have just started following this stock for the past month and had little idea of what's coming for it. However, there's a lot of chatter about its new streaming service Disney+. New contents like The Mandalorian had definitely drove sign ups and more contents based on Marvel (WandaVision &amp; The Falcon and Winder Soldier) that are coming in 2020 is definitely an encouraging sign. The service, however, is yet to proof if it can surpass Netflix in terms of contents. The buy in seems to be reasonable (assuming it has yet to fully price in Disney+) but there's some risks attached. \n3. AMD - Had once owned the stock before it rallied in 2018. From what I've read so far, a lot of the stock's momentum seemed to be driven by the Ryzen chips, which is now widely believed to be the industry leader. There's also some talks that Apple may consider the change from Intel to using AMD's CPU's in the far future. More research is definitely needed to justify the current price to buy in. May need your opinion on this as well. \n\nFeel free to add your stock ideas in the comments as well but be sure to add your reasons and justifications for the price too. Otherwise, it wouldn't be much of an idea to discuss about. Looking forward to your replies!",

I'm 26 and I didn't start investing until the beginning of 2018, my parents are Asian immigrants and have never invested in stocks and think they're akin to gambling especially after the recession. I say this to emphasize how little I knew of stocks and the fact that it was frowned upon. I made IRA contributions in 2016 and 2017 but just let it sit in money markets collecting less than 2% interest, stupid I know. In the beginning of 2018 I decided I wanted give investing a chance with approximately $12k. I read a handful of Warren Buffet quotes and thought I was ready. \n\nFast forward to December 2018 and my portfolio was **down 25%**. My $20k of contributions was only worth $14k, I literally lost an entire year of contributions. I felt like my parents were right and I was an absolute idiot for wasting not only my time but my hard earned money playing with the stock market. On the news and even reddit people were talking about how the market was going into another recession. I was super depressed and just stopped looking at my account all together. I even came here and posted on 12/21/18 how defeated I felt. *Be greedy when others are fearful,* perhaps the Oracle of Omaha's most famous and cliche quote. I couldn't stop hearing it in my head so in January 2019 I decided to double down on my picks and invested my entire $6k contribution. \n\nI'm really happy to say that a year later today my portfolio is **up 41%** and worth $44k on $26k invested. A lot of this is definitely due to luck but if I did not push myself to buy this time last year my portfolio would be barely break-even today. This is my portfolio today: [https://imgur.com/a/Da06frF](https://imgur.com/a/Da06frF)\n\nThis subreddit has been a great community for me, a place for ideas, to vent, and to gauge sentiment.

      "selftext": "**TL:DR**  I own shares.  Someone's been buying A LOT of BPT shares this week. The asset of the trust is currently under acquisition.  The buyer is not obligated to pay the royalties &amp; why would the seller continue to after the sale but someone has to.  I expect a move to acquire shares on the open market to gain majority ownership to close the trust.  If thats not the case, based on the buyers talents in other areas, I see improved production and increased field life.  Tell me what I'm missing here. Share your thoughts..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclosure:** \n\nI do not work for BP, I have never worked for BP, my understanding and interest come from being an Alaskan and I have worked in the Alaskan north slope oilfield.  I am not an insider.  I DO have a position in BPT.  The information provided comes from my first-hand account, publicly available information including the 10Q &amp; 10K reports.\n\n**Current State &amp; Some Context of the Acquisition:** \n\nHilcorp is currently in the process of acquiring the BP Alaska subsidiary from BP America (BP PLC).  The formal acquisition completion date is up in the air: it could be as early as April or as late as December.\n\nBP Alaska has a number of leases on the north slope of Alaska, one of which is the Prudhoe Bay Unit which has shared ownership with other oil companies -- BP Alaska is actually the minority shareholder at \\~26%.  The BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust pays a royalty based on the oil production from the Prudhoe Bay Unit alone.  Hilcorp is buying ALL of BP Alaska and therefore absorbing the share of the Prudhoe Bay Unit.  Hilcorp has a reputation of improving production in older, depleting oil fields.\n\n**The Opportunity:** We do not know what will come about with BPT.\n\nFrom my understanding there are a number of scenarios that will play out.\n\n**Scenario 1:** BP America will continue to pay royalties from the oil Hilcorp produces from Prudhoe Bay.  Hilcorp is not obligated to. \n\n*From 10K “BP Alaska may sell or transfer all or part of its working interest in the Prudhoe Bay Unit, although such a transfer will not relieve BP of its responsibility to ensure that BP Alaska’s payment obligations with respect to the Royalty Interest and under the Trust Agreement and the Conveyance are performed. BP will be released from its obligation under the Support Agreement upon the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of BP Alaska’s working interest in the Prudhoe Bay Unit if the transferee \\[Hilcorp\\] agrees in writing to assume and be bound by BP’s obligation under the Support Agreement. The transferee’s agreement to assume BP’s obligations must be reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the transferee must be an entity having a rating of its unsecured, unsupported long-term debt of at least A3 from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a rating of at least A- from Standard &amp; Poor’s, or an equivalent rating from at least one nationally-recognized statistical rating organization (after giving effect to the sale or transfer and the assumption of all of BP Alaska’s obligations under the Conveyance and all of BP’s obligations under the Support Agreement).*\n\n**Scenario 2**: Hilcorp agrees to the Support Agreement and pays the royalties until the trust is terminated.a.\tThe Trust will terminate if either (a) holders of at least 60% of the outstanding Units vote to terminate the Trust or b.\tthe net revenues from the Royalty Interest for two successive years are less than $1,000,000 per year (unless the net revenues during the two-year period have been materially and adversely affected by certain extraordinary events).\n\n**Discussion**: Royalty distributions for the last four quarters was $35 Million.  I think we’re far from 1 million mark, especially if Hilcorp is successful with their value proposition of improving production.\n\n**If either Scenario 1 or 2** is the case, Hilcorp’s value prop is to extend the life of depeted fields, they are very efficient in doing well workovers and there is also a couple of coil rigs on the slope that are faster and will likely result in a production boost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Scenario 3:** Hilcorp or BP Alaska (or BP America) buys up enough open market shares to close the trust. OR They buy up a significant amount of shares, lobbies for support and puts it up to a vote.\n\n**Discussion:** We’re at \\~5x the trading volume in the last two days compared to the 3-month average.  Someone is buying a lot of shares, and I’m hard pressed to believe Warren Buffett is going long.  I’m also hard pressed to believe now there is some institutional investor that’s caught wind of the deal.. the news has been out for months. I also doubt the volume pickup is strictly due to Friday’s trust distribution announcement.\n\nHilcorp certainly doesn’t want to pay the royalties, especially if they’re not obligated to! And, BP America certainly doesn’t want to pay royalties for a field they’re not getting any money from!  I theorize one of these operators is making a move to scoop up shares on the open market to his 60% share ownership needed to close the trust.  Hilcorp is spending $5.6 Billion on the deal.  Certainly, they expect the Prudhoe Bay unit to perform.\n\nPlease share your thoughts, tell me what I’m missing.  I will wait and see what happens here, per the SEC.  Anyone taking a &gt;5% share must disclose within 10 days, so we’ll soon see what happens.  I’m keeping a close eye on volume during the next couple of weeks..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Theres also this tidbit: “Upon termination of the Trust, BP Alaska will have an option to purchase the Royalty Interest at a price equal to the greater of* \n\n*(i) the fair market value of the Trust property as set forth in an opinion of an investment banking firm, commercial banking firm or other entity qualified to give an opinion as to the fair market value of the assets of the Trust, or*\n\n*(ii) the number of outstanding Units multiplied by (a) the closing price of Units on the day of termination of the Trust on the stock exchange on which the Units are listed, or (b) if the Units are not listed on any stock exchange but are traded in the over-the-counter market, the closing bid price on the day of termination of the Trust as quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market.* \n\n*If BP Alaska does not exercise its option, the Trustee will sell the Trust property on terms and conditions approved by the vote of holders of 60% of the outstanding Units, unless the Trustee determines that it is not practicable to submit the matter to a vote of the Unit holders and the sale is made at a price at least equal to the fair market value of the Trust property as set forth in the opinion of the investment banking firm, commercial banking firm or other entity mentioned above and on terms and conditions deemed commercially reasonable by that firm.*  ***(what the hell does that entail, seems pretty subjective... is this their get out of jail free card?)***",

International oil prices initially surged 4%. But like stocks, crude steadied as the Iranian attacks were less than feared. (CNBC)\n* The direction of the Dow, which closed lower Tuesday on concerns about rising U.S.-Iranian tensions before the airstrikes, could be swayed by the ADP’s December report on private sector employment this morning. The government issues its monthly employment report on Friday. (CNBC)\n* Weekly mortgage applications fell in final weeks of 2019, but homebuyers were out shopping (CNBC)\n* Constellation Brands (STZ), Lennar (LEN), and Dow stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) are out with quarterly earnings this morning. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) and Helen of Troy (HELE) are among the companies releasing numbers after today’s closing bell. (CNBC)\n* There are no reports of any U.S. service members being hurt after Iran last night launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against multiple bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq. President Donald Trump tweeted: “All is well!” He plans to make a statement this morning.

There were no survivors. Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 had 167 passengers and nine crew members on board. (CNBC)\n* United Airlines (UAL) will take a $90 million charge against fourth-quarter earnings, due to Hong Kong disruptions from ongoing anti-government protests. United said the protests have reduced demand for travel to Hong Kong. (Reuters)\n* Fugitive ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn’s lawyers attacked the auto maker this morning, before he was scheduled to hold a highly-anticipated news conference, accusing Nissan of using a “flawed, biased” internal probe to engineer his arrest. (Reuters)\n* Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Senate Republicans are prepared to move forward on a Trump impeachment trial without agreeing first to rules about witnesses and without any Democratic votes. (CNBC)\n* Facebook (FB) and eBay (EBAY) have removed hundreds of groups and accounts engaged in trading fake reviews, after the U.K. antitrust regulator flagged concerns over them in June.

When comparing companies that pay out dividends quarterly to those who do yearly and reinvesting them, I came to the conclusion that yearly dividends seem more advantageous. One side of me understands that my maths are wrong but the other side cant seem to find the mistake. Please enlighten me.\n\nIt goes as this:\n\nLets say company X has a 6% yearly dividend yield.\n\nCase 1: Yearly payment. \nIf we invest $12000 ($1000 per month) at the end of the year we would receive 12000*0.06 which = $720, putting us at $12720.\n\nCase 2: Quarterly payment. \nSame thing, invest $3000 ($1000 per month) and at the end of the first quarter receiving $3000*0.015=$45 putting us at $3045. Next quarter we add another $3000, standing at 6045 and getting 6045*0.015=$90.67 putting us at $6135.67. Third quarter comes around and again we add $3000. From that we get $9135.67*0.015=$137.03 in dividends. Add that to our total and we are at $9272.7. And the last quarter is the same story, add $3000 = $12272.7 and from that we get $12272.7*0.015 = $184.09. Overall this adds up to $12456.8 compared to $12720. \n\nIf we continued the same way for several years the difference would increase.\n\nPlease provide some kind of mathematical explanation or any other way of understanding this because i cant seem to be able to work it out. \n\nThank you.",

      "selftext": "I have a large amount of shares (approaching over 10,000) in a particular company that people for a long time said was going nowhere. It is opening facilities worldwide and about to start full-time production later this year when they're all open. The company is doing this to be able to provide worldwide volume once they start production and basically not hit any snags due to being overwhelmed.\n\nI feel extremely confident in the company and have done thorough research for months. I strongly feel that this company is going to blow up when everything opens. Customers are already waiting for products, partnerships have been signed, patents have been acquired, licenses have been put in for already and approved, etc. Very unique company with technology and methods that far surpass their competitors who really aren't competitors because they can't produce similar products. A couple of months from now, their efforts so far will be released and profits are estimated at over $10 million. Future estimates after that keep going up and will only increase because I'm familiar with the demand and partner companies.\n\nThis is a hobby investment that has turned more serious for me once I saw the potential. I am in the USA and use a Roth IRA (Fidelity) to do the trade. I do active trading, so it is more so the \"sell and wait 2-3 days to clear\" type of deal before buying again. I'm not in a hurry to trade like a stock market broker and I'm perfectly fine with this method. As I understand it, there also aren't any taxes on the gains in a Roth IRA, which is another reason why I like it. So I don't have to keep up with that stuff.\n\nIt is an OTC trade. I got that many shares at pretty low prices. I researched and watched the stocks of the company for months before initially investing, then I invested a certain amount. It wasn't all that much. When I saw the weekly trend of it averaging an up-and-down 6 to 8 cent variation per week, I basically started selling when it went up 6-8 cents and then letting the money in the Roth IRA clear and buying back days (or a week or whatever time) when it dropped down as much as I have seen it drop before. Then I would buy back in, gain about 500-600 shares in that single buy and wait for it to climb up another 6-8 cents again, then sell again. Repeating the \"sell when high, buy when low\" strategy. \n\nI literally started with hundreds of shares and have turned that into 10,000 shares with very little of my own money. The other money came from selling when high and buying back when low. Now, will this method always work? No. I can think of two scenarios. One, the price of course could drop (and for any company, for that matter - risk is always there in investing) and not go back up and I could lose my money. The company could tank for some reason, even when appearing to do well, and I could lose it that way.\n\nThe second way...the company could surge in price during one of the times when I've sold when it was high and the price could climb much higher and the company could take off. Yes, I'd lose some money, but could easily just go all-in again.\n\n**Now here's my question in all of this**:  Is there anything that I'm missing from this scenario? Clearly, my balance has increase positively from doing this and I have a lot of shares in the company. The company seems to be doing really well. I'm asking if there's anything that I *don't know of* in regards to the back-and-forth trading that I'm doing as active trading. Are there any unforeseen stipulations that I'm overlooking? Of course, as the amount of shares increases and the balance increases, every time that I do a sell-and-buy trade like that, the amount of shares continues to climb. When I first started out, I gained hundreds of shares per trade. Now I gain thousands more shares simply using that same method. A lot of people seem to call this method \"share recycling\" and I see some investors in the company (I monitor a major online forum for investors in the company) who are just buying in at x price and not even doing any of that. They're just buying more and more, even if the price keeps climbing, but not recycling any. I have a lot more shares than they do, of course.\n\nSo...are they just really overlooking this opportunity or am I missing something? I commented my number of shares on the forum and the low price that I bought in at and I got some comments that said, \"You're going to make some big bucks!\" from a lot of people who couldn't believe the number of shares and the super low price from where I sold when it was higher and then went all-in one day when it hit its lowest point of the year before rebounding. Just trying to cover my bases. What can you comment on this?",

      "selftext": "I have over 10,000 shares in a particular company presently. I did my research on the company a long time ago and have been investing for months. It has gotten better and better with time, they're in \"facility building mode\" around the world, basically. Profits above $10 million are forecasted a couple of months from now. They just posted over $1 million profit for the past fiscal quarter. It is expected to keep increasing after that as they open the buildings that they're constructing worldwide. Unique company, unique tech, the only company in the world capable of such production for a particular product of much higher quality than all of their competitors. Lots of potential partners, with some signed already. Lots of potential products and research that has been made by their own team of scientists and they basically sell those product ideas and formulas to client companies. The client companies start producing them as if they are their own idea, basically.\n\nI invested a small amount of money initially. I have \"share recycled\" my way from hundreds of shares bought initially with my own money to over 10,000 shares, most of which I didn't contribute a dime to. I saw a rollercoaster effect in the market on a weekly basis and memorized it for that company. It was like clockwork and I became darned good at predicting it. I'm still doing it to this day and hoping to get to 50K or more shares. I do about 2 trades per week in a Roth IRA via Fidelity. When I see the price spike up about 6-8 cents to what I feel is the \"max\" it will reach given the current waiting status, I sell. I wait for it to drop down to the regular weekly low about 6-8 cents lower than that and I buy back at a much lower price. As the price rises again, I gain money. I can usually gain a good bit by selling. \n\nFor instance, 10,000 shares x .06 cent increase in the stock for the week. I see it and sell. That's $600 of increase that I've old, basically. I do active trading, so I do about one sell and one buy every week or so. It takes 2-3 days sometimes for the cash to post and be available again. Perfectly okay with this method. I buy back when it drops down to x amount, about $0.06 lower. Because of the number shares, that buys about another 2,100 shares. The number of shares that I gain with each trade and the balance itself will of course increase with each trade. Eventually it will be like 5,000 or 10,000 shares gained with each recycle.\n\nOf course, I can't do this forever. But there's an internet forum for that company's stock. Everyone else seems to have bought in at a higher price and just dug in their feet at that price, leaving it. Then they're buying it more on top of that at a similar or higher price. When I posted my share numbers and the low price that I bought it for, they all seem shocked and did the, \"Man, you're going to make some big bucks!\" thing.  I want to take it to 50,000 shares or 100,000 if I can get it up there quickly enough, then stop and wait. When it goes up to the much higher dollar amounts (people are predicting $10 to $20 a share and it may very well hit that and go above it in a year or two), I want to pull out and move half of that money over into a target retirement fund or other safe place to grow a little and yet remain more stable than all stocks. The other half I want to put into a total stock market index fund for growth and move a little at a time over to the more stable fund as it grows with time so that too much isn't in to stocks.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this share recycling method? Apparently no taxes get paid on gains in Roth IRAs. I like that. I don't want to do day trading too quickly, anyway. So am I overlooking anything?\n\nOf course, I can reason that something could go wrong. The company could tank and I could lose most or all of it. I'll take that risk. Also, I could sell all shares during one of the half recycles and the share price could shoot up one day and cause me to have to buy back in at a much higher price and therefore have a lot less shares. I'm willing to take that risk to keep bumping up share numbers. It seems to greatly outweigh that if it grows as fast as other investors in it seem to think it will.\n\nSo...my question is more so, \"Why aren't they doing this?\"  Is there anything else in the background that I need to know about share recycling? Why do I seem to be doing better than what appear to be seasoned investors? Are they just scared to sell all in fear that the price could jump or something?",

Here are your pre-market movers and news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, January 9th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/09/dow-indicated-at-record-trump-war-powers-vote-and-tesla-new-high.html)\n\n* U.S. stock futures were pointing to more gains on Wall Street after Wednesday’s turnaround that saw the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq log new intraday highs. The Nasdaq also closed at a new high, and indications this morning point to the Dow joining the record run on an easing of fears about a possible escalation of U.S.-Iran hostilities. The projected gains for the Dow would be enough for it to set a new intraday high at the open. It needs a little less than 128 points. (CNBC)\n* On today’s economic calendar, the Labor Department is out with its weekly report on initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Additionally, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, New York Fed President John Williams, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard all have public appearances today. (CNBC)\n* Lighting company Acuity Brands (AYI) is among the few companies issuing quarterly earnings this morning, while home builder KB Home (KBH) and lubricant producer WD-40 (WDFC) issue numbers after the closing bell.\n* For the first time, Tesla’s (TSLA) stock market value has eclipsed the combined values of General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). The electric car maker’s stock jumped nearly 5% on Wednesday, closing at a record $492.14 per share and elevating its market capitalization to almost $89 billion, or $2 billion larger than the sum of GM’s and Ford’s respective market caps of $50 billion and $37 billion. (Reuters)\n* The House will vote today on a resolution to curb President Donald Trump’s power to take military action against Iran. Nancy Pelosi said some members of Congress have “serious, urgent concerns” about Trump’s strategy, which the administration did not assuage with a briefing or its “insufficient” notification of the strike to Congress under the War Powers Act. (CNBC)\n* Trump pulls back from more military action in Iran crisis, promises new sanctions (Reuters)\n* GOP Sen. Mike Lee: Iran briefing from Trump administration was ‘insulting and demeaning’ (USA Today)\n* Two rockets reportedly hit the Green Zone in Iraq’s capital of Baghdad, a day after Iran launched missiles at bases housing U.S. and other coalition forces in Iraq. The rockets were fired several hours after Trump declared that Iran appeared to be standing down from military conflict with the U.S. (CNBC)\n* A Ukrainian International Airlines plane that crashed shortly after leaving Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board, was reportedly on fire before impact, according to Iran’s civil aviation authority. The plane’s trajectory indicated it strayed from its route and was on its way back to a nearby airport at the time of the crash. (CNBC)\n* Here are the unanswered questions about the deadly plane crash in Iran (CNBC)\n* China’s Vice Premier Liu He, head of the country’s negotiation team in China-U.S. trade talks, will sign a “Phase One” deal in Washington next week. No version of the text has been made public, and Chinese officials have yet to publicly commit to key points such as increasing imports of U.S. goods and services by $200 billion over two years. (Reuters)\n* A federal appeals court allowed the Trump administration to move forward with plans to use billions of dollars in military construction money to build a long-promised wall along the border with Mexico. (WSJ)\n* Following a secretive escape last week from Japan to Lebanon, former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn publicly defended himself Wednesday against accusations of financial misconduct and misuse of corporate resources. Ghosn adamantly denied all charges against him and defended his decision to become an international fugitive by fleeing Japan as a necessity to receive a fair trial and “escape injustice.” (CNBC)\n* Lebanese investigators finish questioning Ghosn, file referred to prosecutor: judicial source (Reuters)\n* Ghosn regrets not accepting US offer to lead GM for double his salary (CNBC)\n* Fugitive former Nissan exec feared he would ‘die in Japan’ if he didn’t escape (CNBC)\n* China’s popular video sharing app TikTok had “multiple” security vulnerabilities, said cybersecurity firm Check Point. It found flaws that could allow hackers to take control of TikTok accounts and manipulate the content, upload and delete videos and reveal personal information such as a private email address. (CNBC)\n* Twitter (TWTR) said it will test new features early this year that would allow users to control who can reply to their tweets, as it looks to limit abuse and harassment on the platform. Social media firms are under pressure to address harassment on their services. (Reuters)\n* Facebook’s final word on political ads: No changes to microtargeting but more control for users (NBC News)\n* Verizon Communications (VZ) is eliminating traditional cable bundles and the handcuffs that often came with them, making it easier for households to switch video packages in the hopes they won’t cut the cord entirely. (WSJ)\n* Accolade, a start-up that helps workers navigate their health benefits and dealings with insurance companies, has hired banks including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to advise ahead of a possible initial public offering, CNBC reported. The company is expected to file later this year.\n* Australian authorities urged another mass evacuation across the heavily populated southeast today as a return of hot weather fanned huge bushfires threatening several towns and communities. Thousands have been made homeless and thousands have had to evacuate repeatedly because of the volatility of the fires. (Reuters)\n* Many Puerto Ricans slept outside and woke up to an island still largely without power after a string of earthquakes rocked their home in recent days. The worst quake, a magnitude 6.4 that struck early Tuesday, killed at least one person, injured at least nine.

I am just putting out next week's most anticipated earnings calendar a day earlier than usual due to not being able to get around to do this tomorrow or this weekend. I really don't like to post these up any earlier than Friday's because sometimes the calendars can look a bit wonky where you might see some companies on the calendar that are actually not scheduled to report, or are reporting on another day, etc etc. but unfortunately I don't really have much of an option here...it's either putting this up now or no earnings thread at all for next week. Anyway, please do me this favor everyone and review carefully the companies that are scheduled to report on their respective days for next week. Admittedly, I did not get a chance to confirm all the companies that are on this week's calendar are actually reporting, but if you see something that doesn't look right, as far as a company that is listed up on this calendar on a particular day that isn't expected to report, please just post a little notice in this thread so that everyone is made aware of it!

Year half later not significant but I'm up 700 after  deploying rest of the 8,000 left and sticking to my strategy and not making emotion plays. The point of this post is start young when your broke. (Clarify was able to invest due to scholarships and family financial support. If you don't have this luxury you should be saving up not investing. If I could go back I you should always have a cushion based off your current living cost and how long it will take to find a stable income to support your cost.) Learn the mistakes now instead of when you actually have a lot of capital to lose. Do your research and prepare but don't over prepare. Once you actually make your first trade you honestly don't know you will react. I think the most important thing is learning your emotions how you react to massive losses, stocks skyrocket, missed opportunities, diversification, and etc. Also Simulation trading means nothing when actually trading.

But then his principle #4 is that you can't see the future by looking in the rear view mirror (more common sense). Hmmm... so am I supposed to believe principle #2 or should I ignore it and make my own conclusions with regards to stocks vs. bonds? \n\nI got really pissed off when he spent almost all of chapter 2 talking about how he and all those other super rich investors would spend a week each year claiming the economy was under attack and withering away while all those journalists, photographers, and videographers were capturing their every word. Meanwhile they were actually pumping millions of dollars into stocks contrary to what their public worries were. Seems very unethical and quite frankly, fucked up. \n\nAgain, I'm only 50 pages in, but I feel like all I'm gonna get out of this book is that when the market is good, invest.

      "selftext": "The market hit new highs this week as the number of news stories picked up considerably.  Despite the lofty levels, a number of the releases identified some cheaply priced value opportunities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Value stocks**\n\nOn Thursday **PVH Corp** $PVH (the owner of global brands including Van Heusen, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein) announced a new regional president for its fast growing Asian business and raised its guidance saying it now expects full year EPS of at least $9.45 (compared to its prior view for $9.43 to $9.45).  Not a huge increase, but with the stock down 25% from year highs and trading on a TTM PE of 11.8 it looks cheap compared to peers such as Tapestry (14.7x), Ralph Lauren (20.9x) and VF Corp (29.5x).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stage Stores Inc** $SSI, the rural department store operator, dropped 10% on Friday after a remarkable run up in the stock over the past two months. It follows a difficult period for the retailer as the company’s profitability had been affected by the retail apocalypse.  To offset negative trends it had recently begun transitioning a number of its stores to an off-price model in an attempt to boost margins.  \n\nHowever, in September the company announced the decision to transition all 783 stores to the off price model by the end of 2020.  A clear signal that the transition was going well.  Subsequently, Q3 figures in November reported comps up 17% (with the 89 converted stores revenues growing 40%). \n\nThat’s a remarkable improvement.  CEO Michael Glazer said on the November 21st earnings call;\n\n*“I want to share with you the incredible excitement that is going on here at Stage Stores. We are absolutely thrilled with our third quarter results. And on nearly every key financial metric, the third quarter of 2019 was a record setting.”* \n\nThe stock price has rocketed after touching a low of $0.55 during the year, but is still only a third of the price it traded for in 2015.  That still looks cheap with a market cap of just $250 million compared to trailing sales of $1.6 billion and full year EBITDA guidance of $37.5 million.  Importantly, with the remaining 90% of stores on target for transitioning by Q3, there is a real potential for the company to increase revenues significantly leveraging fixed costs and boosting margins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Wednesday, strip club operator **RCI Holdings** $RICK reported sales up 10.1% to a record $47.8 Million with same store sales also increasing 0.7%. However it did little for the stock which was down 5% on the year and down 20% from this years highs.  “Highs” may not be the best word for RCI which is trading on just 11.5x trailing earnings and just 7.6x current year estimates.  \n\nThe company has been hit by dissatisfaction regarding governance that has resulted in the resignation of its auditor and a formal investigation by the SEC into related party transactions.  That’s the type of news no investor wants to hear.  However, for investors that accept that strip club industry executives are not always the same as your typical Wall Street executive then the current valuation looks attractive. RCI Hospitality enjoys high growth, high margins, strong cash flows, and a regulatory moat that protects its business and profits.  The industry remains highly fragmented and there is a huge potential for growth through acquisitions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Growth Stocks**\n\n**SmileDirectClub** $SDC announced on Monday that it was launching a new line of oral care available exclusively at Walmart. That is good news but surely the bigger story is that this $4 billion company is disrupting a huge market. \n\nIt is estimated that there are 124 million potential orthodontic customers in the U.S. and half a billion worldwide. That's a total addressable market of $245 billion in the U.S. and $700 billion in the rest of the world. That is a global TAM of $945 billion with SmileDirectClub's current market cap amounting to a tiny fraction of that.\n\nThe company is high risk and speculative.  It faces challenges from the dental lobby, state regulators and a class action suit.  However when considered against the huge potential opportunity and cheap valuation, it looks like a tempting gamble. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso on Monday **Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico** $PAC reported passenger traffic increase of 11.4% for December.  Nothing new there.  Mexican air travel is a growth industry and PAC is the leading Mexican airport operator with diverse operations in strategic locations.  PAC has recently agreed its 5 year development plan with the Mexican government including healthy rates and no meaningful changes to capital expenditures. That takes away some uncertainty and the stock has risen 36% this year.  Trading on 18.1x next year’s forecast earnings, with favorable long term trends, it still looks very reasonably priced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pharmaceuticals**\n\nI**ntra-Cellular Therapies** $ITCI dropped after reporting a public offering on Wednesday that would dilute existing shareholders by 21%.  That’s larger than expected but shareholders shouldn’t really complain.  The stock soared before Christmas after the company reported FDA approval on Monday for Caplyta (lumateperone) for treating schizophrenia. Intra-Cellular Therapies expects to launch Caplyta at the end of the first quarter of 2020 making it the first commercialized asset of Intra-Cellular Therapies.\n\nThe stock is up 100% over the past year with a market capitalization of $1.6 billion but that looks reasonable compared to a TAM of $7 billion.  Additionally ITCI is expected to seek approval for other neurological diseases, including treatments for Alzheimer's, depression, and bipolar disorder.  That would open up a potential $25 billion market for Calypta. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSMBC Nikko initiated its coverage of **Dermira** $DERM with Outperform rating and $21 (39% upside) price target. Dermira has tripled since October when the company published positive results from a mid-stage clinical trial for its new eczema treatment, lebrikizumab. 44% of patients treated with lebrikizumab exhibited 90% skin clearance. Thats similar to recently launched eczema treatment Dupixent. However, unlike Dupixent, lebrikizumab also proved to be effective at reducing chronic itching (pruritus) which is often a significant issue for eczema sufferers. It also had less of an impact on the immune system.\n\nDermira received a $1.1 billion bid from Ely Lily on Friday that looks low.  There are nearly 7 million eczema sufferers in the US with currently untreatable conditions and the total addressable market for Dermira is estimated at $5 billion. Given its commercial advantages, regarding pruritus, Dermira should take a significant share of this if it can successfully transition from Phase 3 trials to FDA approval.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn contrast to Dermira, **Sorrento Therapeutics** $SRNE jumped 40% to $4.76 on Friday after receiving a non-binding bid from a private equity fund for $7.00.  \n\nSorrento has a number of commercial and late stage non-opioid pain therapies as well as four immuno-oncology (treatments that use the body's immune system to fight cancer) programs in development. Management as usual believe that these have a great outlook for growth. To be fair the non-opioid market is expected to grow from $4 billion to $9 billion over the next 10 years and I have to say it looks like an exciting opportunity for Sorrento with numerous therapies and a market cap of just $763 million (after the recent increase).\n\nThe $7 bid follows two bids in December between $3-$5 which Sorrento immediately declined saying “the offer significantly undervalued Sorrento and was not in the best interest of the Company's stockholders.\"  The $7 bid, binding or not, suggests other parties may very well agree.  Either way, management clearly think the company’s value is well in excess of Friday’s close at $4.76 and, with all their insider knowledge, they probably know more than most.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Insider buying**\n\nBoth the President and CEO of **Hersha Hospitality Trust** $HT picked up around $400,000 of stock on Tuesday.  Hersha is a small hospitality REIT focusing on quality hotels in \"gateway cities\" clustered on both coasts of the U.S.  The two executives already had significant holdings but it’s a vote of confidence in the business after a difficult period competing with Airbnb that has seen the stock price fall 50% over the past five years.     \n\nIn a November interview CEO Jay Shah said the company will be benefiting from some tailwinds in 2020 as a number of properties that were closed from hurricane Irma have now reopened and that Miami is forecast to be a top growth market in 2020.  When asked about the competition from Airbnb, Shah said that many municipalities are cracking down on illegal rooms with additional regulations resulting in some markets seeing Airbnb rentals fall by up to 50%. \n\nHersha’s stock price is down 23% over the past year.  Its trading at a 40% discount to book value with an 8% dividend yield and payout ratio of just 55% of AFFO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Finally**\n\nAn article in Fool.com on Wednesday highlighted **Valens GroWorks** $VLNCF as one of the top marijuana stocks to buy.  A rare combination of revenue growth of 200% (expected in 2020) with a forward PE of just 8.0. \n\nValens processes cannabis and hemp biomass to produce the resins, distillates, concentrates, and targeted cannabinoids being used in edibles, infused beverages, and topicals.  That puts Valens right in the middle of some of the hottest trends in cannabis. Its customers include all of the main Canadian cannabis producers, including Canopy Growth, HEXO, Organigram, and Tilray with most being tied into multi year contracts.\n\nCannabis extracts, edibles, and non-edible derivatives could generate Canadian sales of close to $6 billion by 2025 according to projections from Ernst &amp; Young.  While the potential for international growth also exists, especially in the US, Europe, Latin America and Australia.\n\nWith a market cap of just $400 million, Valens looks like a bargain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Follow\" me if you would like to receive updates during the week.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everyone.  Some of the stocks mentioned are risky small cap and/or highly speculative.  Please do your own research.",

      "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 13th, 2020.\n\n# **Trade deal and earnings season could shape the market’s next moves  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/trade-deal-and-earnings-season-could-shape-the-markets-next-moves.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The stock market’s race to new highs could be put to the test in the coming week by two events — the signing of a phase one trade deal with China and the start of corporate earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have been gaining steadily since it became clear late last year that the U.S. and China reached a truce and would agree to a phase one deal, rolling back some tariffs and avoiding new ones. But details of that deal have never been made clear, so markets will be focused on any information that will clarify how it will be implemented and what checks and balances there are to ensure compliance.\n*****\n&gt; The market has also reached a lofty premium that could be challenged if earnings disappoint, though analysts widely expect to see the majority of companies able to beat lowered expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Banks are first up with J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo releasing earnings Tuesday, and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs reporting on Wednesday. Earnings could be a slight positive for the market, analysts say.\n*****\n&gt; “I think earnings are going to be a good component,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “Companies have lowered the bar enough to where I think most of the companies will easily step over it, and we’ll all have a sigh of relief that the earnings this quarter won’t be as bad as it could have been. It won’ be strong. We’ve seen revisions across all of the sectors come down.”\n*****\n&gt; According to Refinitiv, fourth quarter earnings are expected to be down 0.6%, based on results of companies that have already reported and estimates for others that have not.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks started out the past week worried about a blowup in the Middle East, after the U.S. killed Iran’s top general. But by midweek, tensions dissipated and stocks were higher. On Friday, stocks sold off again, after a lackluster jobs report, though the Dow briefly topped 29,000 for the first time. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.9% for the week, at 3,265, and the Dow was off 0.7% at 28,823.\n*****\n&gt; The China trade deal is expected to be signed on Wednesday, and while it may be a nonevent, it has the potential for surprises. The deal most likely will be seen as a positive, but it is not expected to do much to curb technology transfers, which are expected to be part of the next phase discussions.\n*****\n&gt; “If the deal is more watered down than anticipated, if there’s skepticism about how China will adhere to its promises” it could be negative, Arone said. “There’s skepticism already. If there’s something in the details that suggest doubt about how are we going to police this or how are we going to enforce this, I think that could cause markets to move some.”\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group said he thinks the market has moved past the trade news. “I think they’ll try to emphasize some IP protection. I honestly think people have already moved on,” he said. President Donald Trump has also lowered expectations by noting that the next phase of the deal would not come until after the election.\n*****\n&gt;# Economy\n&gt; Markets also will focus on some of the upcoming data in the week ahead, particularly CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for December on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Core CPI is expected to increase by 0.2%, putting the annual pace at 2.3%, and retail sales are expected to rise by 0.3%.\n*****\n&gt; “The holiday season when all was said and done should have been pretty good. You had low gas prices, rising wages and a super tight labor market. It has to be good,” said Joseph LaVorgna, Natixis chief economist Americas.\n*****\n&gt; There is also a parade of Fed speakers in the coming week, but they are unlikely to offer any clues about when the Fed will move off the sidelines. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who voted against the Fed’s rate cuts three times last year, speaks Monday. There are a half dozen more appearances by other Fed officials, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, who speaks Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; LaVorgna said the Fed could begin to focus more on the rapid rise in the stock markets, as Kaplan did this past week. “It seems to me the hawks might worry about financial instability and the market being excessively exuberant,” said LaVorgna.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CmRDJ3H.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HlaBE2S.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/Mo3s1ZX.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/4GkiL8Z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wA851N3.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nbY9KQS.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vGlTvp3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2v0Lf7h.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zi8Gzi5.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lm2IGKk.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YDrQkZN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VzMB0Wn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/V8ea808.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/HXQ4K2F.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Expiration Week: Mixed Bag Last 21 Years\n\n&gt; Over the past thirty-seven years, since 1983, the S&amp;P 500’s performance during January’s option expiration week has been a tepid. Friday has been up 21 and down 16, and the entire week has been down five-plus times for every four times it has been up. However, in the past twenty-one years (1999-2019), the S&amp;P 500’s performance has taken a turn for the worse with expiration day falling ten times with an average loss of .08% and the full-week declining 14 times with an average loss of 0.74%. DJIA and NASDAQ have similar track records since 1999.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6fef4ad5d96054008c1e22c647ef89b/f40a371ec0746e08-6e/s500x750/7ef3526f7c7aa39a8e897b65d44ba23869993cbe.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3c8ee058fc90aa22adb4e5a8985e306/f40a371ec0746e08-73/s500x750/a78a5931f9321df2ca4938803b6adba45329fa6c.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b5741ff34a0d07dd0833b196609574b9/f40a371ec0746e08-77/s500x750/282a979aced717ffa33f2e4ebf6cac6eb92e0118.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 378 Days since Last 10% S&amp;P 500 Correction &amp; Still Counting\n\n&gt; There is little doubt that 2019 was a good year for the market. DJIA advanced 22.3%, S&amp;P 500 climbed 28.9% and NASDAQ jumped 35.2% in 2019. Even for a pre-election year, those gains are above average. Gains of this magnitude also have a tendency to cause some uneasiness as valuations are generally getting stretched and thoughts turn to profit taking or the possibility of a pullback or a correction.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P 500 completed its last correction (defined as a 10% or greater decline, but less than 20% because that would be a bear market then) on December 24, 2018 after falling 19.8%. That was 378 calendar days ago and it was the fifth correction of the current bull market that begun on March 9, 2009. Since 1948, the current bull market is the second longest in duration and magnitude. The longest was 4494 calendar days from December 4, 1987 through March 24, 2000. S&amp;P 500 gained 582.1% during that bull while enduring five corrections. Even though it has been 378 days since the last does not mean one is imminent. S&amp;P 500 has gone as along as 2553 calendar days without a correction before (October 1990 through October 1997).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5fbda173e8dc370504a0f606427f62e1/ed8a77a7fe8ca133-e0/s540x810/8954d23b3dc93b4653c4fbb6e79bc909488fdeec.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Stocks Do During Geopolitical Events\n\n&gt; It was a volatile night for the U.S.-Iran conflict.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P 500 Index futures dipped 1.5% and global markets swung after Iran shot several ballistic missiles at U.S.-Iraqi military bases. Markets recovered their losses overnight on news that there were no American casualties, but tensions remain high in the Middle East.\n\n&gt; As concerns over the Iran conflict continue to build, we’ve received many questions asking what this could mean for the market outlook. We discussed our initial thoughts regarding the conflict in our January 6 blog, but we believe it is important for investors to remember that there have been many times historically when stocks stood strong in times of conflict. In fact, the best ever annual Dow Jones Industrial Average gain was in 1915 during World War I.\n\n&gt; “No doubt worries over Iran have investors on edge,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stocks could be volatile for a while, but the impact to stocks from geopolitical events historically has tended to be short-lived.”\n\n&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 fell 5% on average in 20 major geopolitical events dating back to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. However, the S&amp;P 500 recovered those losses in fewer than 50 calendar days on average.\n\n&gt; A special thanks to Sam Stovall of CFRA for sharing the data below with LPL Research.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/geopolitical-events-and-stock-market-reactions.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The First Five Days Of 2020 Could Have Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; The first five days of 2020 are in the books. Although the headlines have been quite scary, equities have picked up right where they left off last year. In fact, after the first five trading days of the new year, the S&amp;SP 500 Index is up a respectable 0.65%.\n\n&gt; Jeffrey Hirsch of The Stock Trader’s Almanac follows and tracks many interesting seasonal patterns. One that we find very interesting states that how stocks perform the first five trading days of a new year could indicate how the full year will go. Now, we’ll be the first to admit no one should invest based only on this adage, but the results have been quite compelling.\n\n&gt; We did some research and found that when S&amp;P 500 returns in the first five trading days of a new year have been higher, the full-year total return for the S&amp;P 500 has been positive 80% of the time. Compare that to returns being up only 60% of the time when the first five days have been lower, and we have something that has our attention. What about big gains? Well, when those first five days have been up more than 2%, the full year return has been positive a very impressive 16 of 17 times! Only 2018 didn’t follow suit when the first five days were up 2% or more.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/do-the-first-5-days-of-a-new-year-matter.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; “Should you ever invest for a full year purely because of the first five days? We would emphatically say no,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But put in context, this seemingly random bit of info does have a very impressive track record. It is only a small piece of the pie, but the good news is we still don’t see any major warning signs that this bull market is over just yet.”\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when the S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 0.65% the first five trading days of a new year—like 2020—the full year has finished in the green 31 out of 35 times, with a very solid 17.2% average annual return. Although we aren’t expecting gains quite that large in 2020, it does help support the case for the bull for at least the rest of this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-first-five-days-of-2020-could-have-bulls-smiling.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# \"Take my crude, please\"\n\n&gt; Crude oil is just about as popular or maybe even less popular than tobacco these days. Sure, there was a brief spike in prices following the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani last Thursday night, but ever since then, crude oil has done nothing but trade lower. Just the fact that crude only managed to rally 3% in the lead up to what many thought to be a full-blown war with Iran shows just how out of favor crude is. This isn't the first time crude hasn't been able to hold onto gains either. As noted earlier this week, besides the last week, there have been two other periods of heightened tensions between the US and Iran over the last year where one would have expected prices to rally, but instead they sold-off.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-Crude-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; When a stock consistently opens at one price and then closes lower than it opened, it's considered a negative as it signals that investors are selling into strength. Applying that logic to crude oil confirms just how out of favor it has become. This week alone, the daily closing price has been lower than its open on all five days. The chart below shows daily streaks where crude oil closed below its opening price going back to the start of 2009. While the current five-day streak isn't anything to write home about, we would note that even before this past week's tensions in the Middle East, in late September/early October there was a streak of 13 trading days where the commodity closed lower than it opened, and that was the longest losing streak since at least the early 1980s! Before that, there was another streak of 7 trading days in July. In other words, two of the five longest streaks since 2009 where crude oil closed below its open both occurred in the last six months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-WTI-Declines.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dow 29,000?\n\n&gt; By posting this, we're probably jinxing it, but the DJIA is on the verge of topping another 1,000 point threshold less than two months after first topping 28,000. While the media makes a big deal of each of these thresholds, we would note that the road to 29,000 from 28,000 is only 3.4%. That's hardly a momentous move. Since Trump became President in January 2017, though, 29,000 would be the 10th 1,000-point threshold that the DJIA would cross under his watch.\n\n&gt; The table below lists the date that the DJIA first crossed each 1,000-point threshold throughout history. For each level, we also include the number of calendar days that elapsed between the first cross of that threshold and the prior one, how large a percentage gain that the 1000-point threshold represents versus the prior one, and then how many times the DJIA has crossed each threshold (on a closing basis) both to the upside and downside. One of the most notable aspects of the table in our view is that even though each threshold is a smaller percentage than the prior one, there have been so few crosses (above and below) of most of the thresholds since the Dow first crossed 19,000 after the 2016 election. 19,000 was only crossed once, and six of the other nine thresholds since then haven't been crossed more than ten times. That's indicative of a market that has been rallying and not looking back.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-DJIA-29000.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 10th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$JPM** \n&gt; * **$APHA** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$C** \n&gt; * **$WFC** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GS** \n&gt; * **$BLK** \n&gt; * **$PNC** \n&gt; * **$FRC** \n&gt; * **$USB** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$PPG** \n&gt; * **$FAST** \n&gt; * **$WIT** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$KSU** \n&gt; * **$TSM** \n&gt; * **$WNS** \n&gt; * **$SJR** \n&gt; * **$AA** \n&gt; * **$BK** \n&gt; * **$CSX** \n&gt; * **$MS** \n&gt; * **$JBHT** \n&gt; * **$HOMB** \n&gt; * **$SCHW** \n&gt; * **$RF** \n&gt; * **$OGI** \n&gt; * **$STT** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CFG** \n&gt; * **$HWC** \n&gt; * **$WAFD** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$EGBN** \n&gt; * **$OZK** \n&gt; * **$BEDU** \n&gt; * **$PBCT** \n&gt; * **$FHN** \n&gt; * **$INDB** \n&gt; * **$VOLT** \n&gt; * **$BMTC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zi8Gzi5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/2sH0ItO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/acnOb3c.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e3hO4am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/duE2t8W.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I9iQ8f1.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pQtl1r8.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lXhI0YM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jpODGmg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NYyWxgm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJ8xHj2.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nsBUIFM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.17.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. $136.07\n&gt; **JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

The correction in gold is over and we are well on our way into the new bull market. The gold stocks don’t get much coverage, but they’ve been the best performing sector and will continue to do so. \n\nThe federal reserve has injected over 500 billion into the repo markets; if you take a look at a chart you can see spikes of green directly corresponding with the amount of liquidity injected. We’re well into QE 4, it’s laughable that the fed won’t call it that; but if they did they would be admitting to debt monetization. Who gives a fuck what they say, care about what they do. They flip flopped on monetary policy last winter, rates going back to 0. Its honestly fucked up how they teach monetary policy and inflation to children. Scumbags would rather see the stock market up in nominal terms, than actually do their jobs and not get involved. \n\nWe’re headed right into a currency crisis. Surprisingly gold has gone up before the drop in the dollar has even started; shows just how weak the dollar is, and how the risk premiums are starting to be built in. \n\nNow I don’t expect the public/general investors to hop into gold until it is well over $2000 an oz. Increasing demand has come from central banks globally, they’ve been buying large amounts of gold and selling off US treasuries. Some people will take advantage of this undervalued asset and buy while it’s cheap; most will be deterred from the stigma. \n\nA lot of people will get caught up in the passive investing scheme. General investors WILL ride this market all the way down. Out of greed they won’t sell, they’d rather lock up their money for years while waiting for it to come back.",

In contrast, executing an option should always be possible, since that burden on the seller side is part of the the option's contract.\n\nIs that reasoning correct?

Using stock data going back to 1871, we show that buying stock on margin when young combined with more conservative investments when older stochastically dominates standard investment strategies?both traditional life-cycle investments and 100%-stock investments. The expected retirement wealth is 90% higher compared to life-cycle funds and 19% higher compared to 100% stock investments. The expected gain would allow workers to retire almost six years earlier or extend their standard of living during retirement by 27 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome key things to discuss (in my view): \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- We're taking young investors only. If you are retiring in 10 years I'm sure you'd delever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- There are ways to leverage that don't involve borrowing money. Example: SSO. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Do daily balancing costs offset the gains? The article above gives a clear explanation of why they DONT. If you think they do (which is a very reasonable position), tell us where these authors make a mistake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- There's a huge psychological element. There's sure to be a 25% crash in the next 20 years. Seeing your entire retirement go down 75% might be a reason not to do this. However, let's suppose you ARE psychologically ready. Then is this the best way to save for retirement?",

(OTC.QB: CYDY)**, (“CytoDyn” or the “Company\"), a late-stage biotechnology company developing leronlimab (PRO 140), a CCR5 antagonist with the potential for multiple therapeutic indications, announced today that the Company has filed for Breakthrough Therapy designation (BTD) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of leronlimab as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC).  \n\n\nThe BTD filing is based on data from the first patient in the Company’s mTNBC Phase 1b/2 trial and an additional single-patient trial under an emergency investigational new drug (IND) protocol evaluating leronlimab for the treatment of HER2+ metastatic, stage 4, breast cancer (MBC).\n\nData from the first patient in the Phase 1b/2 trial showed the patient had no detectable circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or putative metastatic tumor cells in the peripheral blood and additional large reductions in CCR5 expression on cancer-associated cells at 11 weeks of treatment with leronlimab. This patient’s data also demonstrated tumor shrinkage of &gt;20% after just a few weeks of treatment. The data from the patient under the emergency IND protocol with HER2+ metastatic, stage 4, MBC showed no sign of new metastatic spots in the liver, lung and brain during the treatment with leronlimab.\n\n“This strong data confirms the power of leronlimab as a CCR5 inhibitor for patients living with mTNBC, and is clearly replicating early animal study results that demonstrated 98% elimination of metastases,” said Bruce Patterson, M.D., chief executive officer and founder of IncellDx, a diagnostic partner of CytoDyn, and an advisor to CytoDyn. “Our collective team of key opinion leaders believes that all patients with similar cancers in regards to CCR5 expression may also benefit from the use of leronlimab, including melanoma, brain, throat, lung, stomach, breast, ovarian, uterine, pancreatic, bladder, and thyroid cancer patients. We also believe the mechanism of action for leronlimab may have potential indications in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, polymyolitis, Crohn’s disease, inflammatory bowel syndrome and psoriasis.”\n\nNader Pourhassan, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of CytoDyn, added: “In the early stages of these clinical trials, we are seeing remarkable improvements in patients living with metastatic breast cancer, a deadly disease that requires imminent new treatment options. We now have several different types of cancer patients reaching out to us to be treated with leronlimab under both the expanded access program, and the Right to Try Act. Currently, we have 4 patients enrolled (2 in the Phase 1b/2 mTNBC trial and 2 under the emergency IND protocol (expanded access program).  Our thought leaders believe that leronlimab may have the potential to treat over 20 different cancer indications and at least 10 autoimmune diseases, including graft versus host disease (GvHD) and NASH.  Based on the number of indications we intend to pursue, we believe we have one of the broadest platform technologies in biotech and are extremely excited to accelerate development of future indications. CytoDyn has been cleared by the FDA to proceed with its Phase 2 trials for both GvHD and NASH. Today’s announcement ushers in a new phase in our corporate history, as we anticipate dramatically increasing the patient population we can help.  We look forward to working with the FDA and continuing to provide additional data that further supports leronlimab as a potential treatment option for patients.”",

At the moment I am mainly invested in tech stocks, simply because this is a market that I understand quite well.\n\nI'm looking to expand further into financial blue chips and my eye fell on the major credit card companies. All three tickers in the title seem to have consistent growth and dividends and just sokid companies overall.\n\nNow one of the things that interests me most when choosing a specific ticker to invest in is its moat or edge in the market. I was therefore wondering what separates these companies and what makes it so they can thrive side by side in the current market.\n\nI know this question will probably sound naive if you are knowledgeable on these companies. I'm really, honestly looking for a starting point on understanding them better.\n\nAny advice and discussion is appreciated. Thanks.",

      "selftext": " \n\nIf you are not familiar what CANSLIM is, it is an acronym that investor William O'Neil used to identify the core qualities of super-performer stocks. These are stocks with the potential to become the next Apple, Netflix or Amazon. Perfect for swing trades and longer term positions.\n\nCANSLIM: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/canslim.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/canslim.asp)\n\n**Tesla** is on a **170%** run since June of 2019, driven by all the key chart patterns I like (breakthroughs of resistance on high volume, small pullbacks on low volume)\n\nI wanted to share some quick thoughts on Tesla from the CANSLIM perspective. Below is each letter and how it applies to Tesla.\n\n· C- Current Quarterly Earnings\n\nTesla's current earnings growth is not great with its most recent quarter EPS % Change of -36% being a prime example. But there are some positives. Last quarter reported an **EPS % Change Surprise of 495% which is huge. Many big runs start with an earnings surprise of over 100% and Tesla's current run could just be the beginning.**\n\n· A- Annual Earnings\n\nLike the quarterly earnings not much positive here. However, Tesla's **3 year Sales Growth Rate is 63%** which could start translating well to earnings soon.\n\n· N- New Highs, New Products\n\nThe CANSLIM way is to focus on stocks continually hitting new highs just like Tesla is doing. This means that everyone getting in right now is in the green and there is **no overhead supply holding the stock back**.\n\nObviously Tesla is making revolutionary products. Its models have brought electric and AI driven vehicles to the consumer market and **every** **new model create waves as we saw from the Cybertruck.** Tesla does not even have to pay for advertising, everyone does that for them on social media\n\n· S- Supply and Demand\n\nYou want to be focusing on stocks where the supply is low and full of long term investors. That way when more buyers come in, that drives the price up due to the high demand and little supply. You can see in Tesla's chart the high price spikes after its earnings report on 10/25. These are not retail buyers **these are institutions, hedge funds and banks taking up large stakes in Tesla.** IBD gives Tesla an **Accumulation/Distribution ranking of A+** and **reports a 4% change in Funds owning the stock.** This metric lags the true number and was just increased.\n\n· L- Leader or Laggard\n\nTesla is Ranked number 2 in its group by IBD, and **its group rank is number 2 out of 197 industry groups**. For CANSLIM its best to focus on the top 20 groups which are leading in the market, so Tesla fits that Bill. The Group also has a relative strength rating of A+. **Tesla is a clear leader among growth stocks.**\n\n· I- Institutional Support\n\nAs already mentioned, **Institutions are taking up positions in Tesla**. Always best to follow the smart money and ride in their wake\n\n· M- Market Direction\n\nWe are currently in a **confirmed uptrend** and so this is a perfect time to be looking for new investments.\n\nSources: [Investors.com](https://investors.com/)\n\n**If you want some more Tesla Analysis I just made this video all about Tesla's 2019-2020 run and how it compares with other recent CANSLIM market winners ARWR and INMD :** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THgtmsCiyCI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THgtmsCiyCI)\n\nFeedback is encouraged!

The update made it clear that the business was still struggling to overcome severe headwinds facing generic drugs in the United States, which are being pressured by unsustainable levels of competition, manufacturing missteps, and changing distribution models. \n\nThe barrage of bad news continued a week later when 44 state attorneys general alleged that generic drug manufacturers from Teva Pharmaceuticals to Lannett Company to Mylan engaged in a far-reaching price-fixing scheme covering dozens of drug products. \n\nIn the final days of July, investors finally had something to look forward to: Mylan and Pfizer's Upjohn division agreed to combine operations. The idea is that bigger is better when it comes to successfully navigating the headwinds of the generic drug industry. The combined company, which will be called Viatris, is expected to generate pro forma revenue of at least $19 billion in 2020. Now what\nFor Mylan, the merger with Upjohn is also a rebranding effort, which could help given all of the negative news swirling around the company's current name.

      "selftext": "Hi [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) !\n\nI got a lot of requests and messages to keep coming out with posts of stock picks. If you missed my last one, here's the [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ej4aqf/top_stock_picks_for_2020/). Hopefully, many of you are enjoying gains in $PGNY - up 30% from the date of the post! :)\n\nFeel free to add comments/questions below and I'll respond as fast as possible.\n\n**Livongo Health (**[$LVGO](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=lvgo&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)**)**\n\n* A consumer digital health company, launched today with a vision to empower people with chronic conditions to live better through the combined power of technology, real-time personalized information, and support from their chosen care team.\n* The platform analyzes data to build a picture of a person’s patterns, while dietitians and physiologists give them real-time advice about diet, medication and exercise by apps or text message. If a patient’s blood sugar is dangerously low or high, a coach will call to warn them within 60 seconds. Inspired by how big tech companies personalize services and nudge people into certain behaviors, Livongo — short for living-on-the-go — started by treating diabetes, before moving on to hypertension, weight loss and mental health.\n\n**Why?**\n\n* Livongo provides a truly disruptive technology and they're targeting a massive TAM (total addressable market). 90% of the $3.5 trillion spent annually on healthcare is dedicated to people with chronic and mental health conditions -- this is only expected to increase.\n* It also just signed its [largest contract ever](https://www.businessinsider.com/livongo-lands-biggest-contract-yet-2019-10) for the US government, allowing it to provide its diabetes solution to 5.3M employees as part of the Federal Employee Health Benefits Platform starting in 2020. Launching at the start of 2020, the tool will be available to 5 million federal employees and their families — and Livongo is optimistic that the partnership will afford it 45,000 new members and a revenue boost of up to $60 million through 2021. That's a significant lift given that Livongo brought in a total of [$68 million](https://e.businessinsider.com/click/18262001.4/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE2MzkyMjUvMDAwMTE5MzEyNTE5MTg1MTU5L2Q3MzEyNDlkczEuaHRt/5d233c18f730436f2414784fB050eba75) in revenue in 2018, it reported in its S-1 filing.\n* LVGO's clients include 20% of the Fortune 500 (Target, Pepsi, Microsoft, Merck, and Citigroup) and boast a high retention rate of \\~96%. They reported a 121% YoY growth in Q3 2019 and continue to grow exponentially.\n* Announced partnership this week that they were collaborating with Dexcom ($DXCM) on user data dissemination. In a joint press release, the two companies said that users of Livongo's health information platform would be able to sync their data from DexCom's G6 glucose (blood sugar) monitoring system.\n* Livongo and health kiosk startup Higi have teamed up for a new program that will bring a Livongo-branded on-stage program to nearly 500 retail pharmacies. Higi has smart health stations at more than 11,000 chain grocery stores and pharmacies sites around the country. They include major brands like Rite Aid, Walgreens, and Kroger.",

I saw the news about new contracts and the initial rise, and I liked the price of 112 that it was at when I put in my order. I wasn't really paying attention to timing, though, and I put in my order after the market closed. Of course the market opened at 125, so my market order was at that much higher price. And as we all know the stock sank fast from that. I was thinking I'd go in at 112 and deal with some fluctuations before I think it's likely to eventually go up. I'm \"long on BYND,\" as you might say. But I screwed up the numbers so I'm down quite a bit in just two days. And it looks like it's still going to go down, more than I though it would.\n\nSo my question: should I cut my losses and buy something else until BYND starts to prove itself better, or should I stick it out?",

He pushes his expensive stock market course which I never tried and probably never will try, but his YouTube channel is worth a follow. He’s a student of Warren Buffet with an emphasis on more modern stocks, that actually makes long term investing interesting. A feat that is difficult because the standard advice is dollar cost average into the S&amp;P 500 or Vangaurd Total Stock Market index. I’ve been following him for over 2 years and made 60% gains last year.",

I was curious just how rare such long weekly runs are. Also, once they end, do stocks typically reverse? Or do they just take a breather?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to download weekly stock performance for all current constituents of the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, which combined to 514 different ticker symbols in all. The data came from Tiingo and went back as far as mid-1972.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's what I found (so far): The just-ended run, with its uninterrupted 69% gain was indeed the longest ever put in by $AMD. The previous record (from 2018) was at 10 weeks, while the most productive in terms of total return was an eight-week run in the fall of 1998, which took $AMD up over 106%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSurprisingly or not, none of the FAANG stocks had any streaks extending beyond 12 weeks. Overall, I found that among the more than 322k streaks I logged, only 61 lasted for 14 weeks or more. The absolute longest, running for 23 weeks (!), was established in 1978 by SYY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterestingly, though the numbers for upward and downward runs are evenly split, \"down\" runs are typically shorter. Among the 61 14-week-plus runs, only 5 were \"down\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the question of what happens next: The average return for the 4 weeks after a 14-week-plus \"up\" run ends was almost precisely what it was for any shorter \"up\" run: A modest 2% decline.",

It’s the ratio of almost all US stock prices vs the GDP. \n\n\n\nThe idea is basically that if the ratio is low, say &lt;40% then stocks right now are generally cheap. At 100% things are generally priced accordingly, and after 100% things are becoming expensive. It was under 40% until the 80s, and currently it’s at 170%. He uses this as an explanation/proof that things are very expensive right now.\n\n\n\nThe two main points I’ve heard from r/investing arguing that the Wilshire-GDP isn’t a useful indicator are:\n\n\n&gt;1. If there were only 1 public company, the Wilshire-GDP would be almost zero.\n\n\nWell yeah that’s true, but there isn’t just 1 company. In fact, there are [far fewer public companies right now than there have been historically](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/where-have-all-the-public-companies-gone-1510869125), so this doesn’t explain why the ratio is currently so high.\n\n\n&gt;2. Many US-based companies now are globally involved, so it isn’t accurate to compare their revenue to the United States GDP.\n\n\nThis is true, and it’s important to keep in mind when talking about the Wilshire-GDP and its validity. Again though, [2018 sales brought in $665 billion in overseas sales](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/27/us-companies-bring-home-665-billion-in-overseas-cash-last-year.html) which does have an impact on the ratio. However, the impact isn’t as big when considering a GDP of $20 trillion.\n\n\nThoughts?",

Obviously if a stock is on a tear I'd want to let it ride, but if it gets around 20% then tapers off or retracts, I try to just lock in that 20% gain then on to the next opportunity. I'm willing to hold longer term if the rate of return is lower than that.\n\nMy view is that there's no where else you're going to find a 20% return in this economy so might as well take that opportunity when it presents itself. Obviously the stock could rebound and go higher but I feel like a 20% return is definitely a win.\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts.\n\n*For example:* I bought some shares of SPCE recently.

      "selftext": "TLDR: Tesla will lend cars for revenue for each ride. Uber will manage legal issues, logistics, and process optimisation with data they already have on car rides. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, this is my thoughts, not based on any evidence. It applies to any other ride sharing company, as well as companies which work on autonomous driving. If anyone has already came up with this idea, please link - I'd love to read that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously it's a look in the future, could be 3, 5, 10 years. I'm not optimistic that it will happen in next few years, but I think it's highly likely we will have it in 7+ years - as 5 might be not enough, while 10 is a bit much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see a lot of negativity around Uber and Tesla. A lot have been said about Tesla, so I will move on to Uber.\n\nPeople are caught up short term bad news, which are white noise in the long term. It's not profitable, faces a lot of legal issues in different countries. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut Uber could be profitable today by upping their prices by 10-20% (I haven't done any calculations, it's just an arbitrary number). Consumers won't feel it much, but it would make a world difference for the company. Why don't they do it then? Because it's one of their moats. Their buisness model is easy to copy, but while they have cash to burn, they can dump prices and improve their services, work out legal issues and competition will stay in the dirt. Once regulations are done and services are feature full, it would require very little upcost to maintain the train going and refining it to earn profits. Uber CEO expects it to be net profitable in 2021 iirc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, let's look further into the future. I'm a software developer, so I view this from my expirience and expertise. Elon was a software dev too, and his approach to problem solving is easy to understand. I think he still uses that brain framework and it did well for him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is fear that autonomous robotaxis will kill Uber's buisness. I believe that is not true. There will be a lot of issues to manage robotaxi network (I will go through it below). It's boring, and there is a smarter way to monetise your autonomous driving. Any software engineer would think on building a service and making others want to use it. Amazon, Google, Microsoft could have solved any software problem in the world, but they focus on cloud services for this exact reason. Writing software is easy, but to build a service this big you need huge capital investment, technology advantage and different kind of skill teams collaborating, which few have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe goal is to get autonomous cars on the roads and get that profits from each ride going.\n\nThere are issues you would need to solve - these are off the top of my head, there should be more:\n\n1) Parking spots - imagine Tesla hiring people just to solve that for each city. Uber already has data they can use to make quick, smart and low effort solutions on this. They can track&amp;learn where drivers stay idle. So Uber could be renting parking lots in popular places, or abusing unpopular parking spots, or whatever else.\n\n2) Goverment regulations - Uber is already solving this problem, it is one of their moats. Nothing changes if you replace human with computer vision and algorithms. Once autonomous driving statistically is 5-10x safer than human (and I think Tesla could have already achieved that. There is huge power behind camera eyes looking at all directions, ever tireless with perfect reaction time), everyone will allow it. In the case of algorithm being the culprit of an accident, compensation will be paid from Tesla's insurance program.\n\n3) Consumer patterns. Uber is already gathering huge data in all countries. So it can anticipate request loads at any place and point of time and optimise fleet distribution accordingly.\n\n4) Charging people with car damage. There will be cameras in cars to watch passengers, but there always are idiots who would damage the interior.\n\n5) Maintaining the cars. Any interior wear, cleaning or simple repairs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nElon Musk is a big dreamer. He solves interesting tasks. These are stupid and tedious. Why would you spend time on it? Better solution is to create a service to lend cars. There would be an app for private owners (average Joe who buys a Tesla). It will allow them to summon their car, share rides etc. But why would average Joe buy a car? It's too expensive once you have a ride service like that. It's so cheap because you don't have to pay drivers. So Tesla creates an API, which is used by both this app, and companies like Uber. They lend cars to them, insure it, and Uber does all the stupid work. Both Tesla and Uber make revenue from each ride.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think about this? Forgive any mistakes, not my native language.\n\nDisclosure - I have a big position in Tesla and want to build a position in Uber",

      "selftext": "**Growth Stocks (Medifast and Cardlytics)**\n\n**Medifast** $MED, the weight management company, presented at the ICR conference on Monday and restated its goal to double in size every 3-4 years and targeted 2021 revenues of $1,000 million (2019 guidance $700-$710 million)  That’s reassuring after a disappointing Q3 when the company was hit by a credit card fraud.\n\nThe stock dropped 29% after those results which seemed a little harsh since the issue was fully resolved, revenues still managed to grow 36.5% and guidance for the full year forecast 40% revenue growth and 26% EPS growth.  It’s not as if Medifast was trading on a big multiple.  The stock has since recovered from the post release drop and then, as it is now, trades on around 2x trailing revenues and 20x trailing earnings.  Pretty reasonable for a growth stock.\n\nThe problem is is that Medifast has been tarred with the same brush as Herbalife and other multi level marketing schemes which use agents to promote sales.  However, the model is quite different. Medifast sells direct to the customer.  Its agents don’t get discounts or handle stock.  That means Medifast isn’t artificially boosting sales by recruiting and selling to its own agents.\n\nA few years ago the company was a quiet and essentially family run affair.  That was until Dan Chard was appointed in 2015.  Formerly the President of Global Sales and Operations at Nu Skin he was the right person for the job.  He developed the Optavia Diet brand and put in place the direct marketing business model. Sales exploded from $273 million to $689 million in less than four years.\n\nWith a product that works and a growing level of demand (driven by obesity) coupled with a capital light highly scalable business model and effective management, Medifast looks very attractive.  The company also has a potentially huge global opportunity but only recently moved to grow internationally with expansion into Hong Kong and Singapore 2019.  Europe and South America and Australia would also make excellent markets.\n\nCEO Dan Chard’s comments this week suggest the bright outlook has not changed.  2021 targets for revenue of $1,000 million and 15% operational margins remain.  That  would generate net income of $115 million if we apply the current effective tax rate.  The $115.58 stock price at Fridays close would represent a forward earnings multiple of just 11.7 (TTM PE 19). With a strong growth forecast, the stock looks cheap.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cardlytics** $CDLX reported preliminary Q4 revenues this week that were up 44% at $69 million and thrashed estimates of $59 million.  The digital advertiser uses a proprietary native bank advertising channel that enables marketers to reach consumers through their trusted and frequently visited online and mobile banking channels.\n\nHowever Cardlytics’ main advantage is the use of purchase intelligence outside the banking channel to boost advertising effectiveness. It’s not difficult to see why knowing what customers have bought in the past is a good predictor of what they will buy in the future.  The company claims that its return on ad spend (ROAS) is 10x the industry average at $30 for each $1 spent. \n\nThe stock price has risen 22% since the announcement but (valued at 11.3x revenues) still looks reasonable compared to peers such as The Trade Desk (valued at 21x). With a huge ROAS advantage, it seems likely that strong growth will continue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Value Stocks (Samsung, Signet and Fluent)**\n\nFool.com reported that this is an exciting and pivotal time for NVIDIA. The company remains at the forefront of gaming and is well placed to thrive in the new frontiers which lie in data center, artificial intelligence, and automotive applications.  However, if the valuation at 35x forward earnings is too much for you (and you don’t mind looking abroad) then perhaps **Samsung Electronics** ($005930.KS) is a better buy. \n\nSamsung has a dominant position in memory chips and memory demand is exploding with the roll out of 5G and applications in artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. The company is currently trading on just 9x last years earnings. Additionally, net cash (including short term investments) is equivalent to a remarkable 25% of its total valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Signet Jewelers** $SIG stock price jumped 40% on Thursday after the company reported a significant beat and raise. The company, whose outlets include Kay Jewelers, Zales and Jared, said comps were up 1.6% as a 13.5% growth in digital sales helped offset a 0.2% decline in brick and mortar sales.  That’s encouraging as it seems jewelry buyers switching to online channels prefer to buy from names they know and trust.  The retailer still faces headwinds but its valuation doesn’t look expensive.  EPS guidance was raised to $3.42 to $3.56 from $2.99 to $3.26 meaning, even after the recent price jump, the $29.52 stock is valued at just 8.4x earnings.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Fluent, Inc**. $FLNT announced on Tuesday that it expects to exceed its previously provided guidance for full-year 2019 with revenue now anticipated to be $280.8 - $281.8 million, representing growth of 12% and an increase from previous guidance of $265 - $267 million. \n\nThe company operates in a fast growing, fast changing and competitive sector - digital marketing. It has built up a huge database of (150 million+) that it can target on behalf of clients. It uses competitions to get details and, importantly, gets consent from clients to contact them. A former CEO has said that if European data protection laws were introduced in the US it would give Fluent a huge advantage as it (largely) already has consent. Indeed Europe offers a huge potential market for Fluent and the company has already reportedly started testing in the UK.\n\nThe news this week is an important development for Fluent whose stock has not had a good year. The data driven digital marketer is down 60% (with a valuation of 0.8x sales and 1.1x book) from the years highs after reducing guidance, not once but twice.\n\nIn fairness, management have been clear throughout that the outlook for the core advertising platform remains very good. The drop in revenues and rising costs are due to the company exiting peripheral ventures that have been explored and not met revenue/return targets (as well as a couple of bad debts deemed unrecoverable). \n\nThe recent results support that thesis and suggests growth should accelerate once the headwind of exiting non core businesses passes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Insider (RumbleOn)**\n\nBoth the CFO and a director at **RumbleOn** $RMBL each picked up $114,000 of stock on Tuesday following $90,000 of purchases by the CEO last month.  (Warning RumbleOn is a high risk nano cap stock)\n\nMake no mistake RumbleOn is tiny with a market cap of just $16 million.  A development stage e-commerce platform that facilitates consumers and dealers to buy, sell, trade, and finance pre-owned recreational vehicles. It primarily focuses on pre-owned Harley-Davidson motorcycles and other powersports and also provides third-party financing services.  However, it is growing rapidly leveraging its capital-light network of 17 regional partnerships and disrupting the old-school pre-owned vehicle dealerships.  Thats a massive and highly fragmented market with around $1 trillion of sales.\n\nRumbleOn expects to achieve its first quarter of EBITDA profitability in 2020 and have a full year of EBITDA profitability in 2021. That seems reasonable given recent growth.  In November Q3 results reported revenues of $220 million compared to just $19 million in 2018. Last week the company reported preliminary results expecting full year 2019 revenue range to $837.7 million to $840.7 million compared to $156 million in 2018.  Margins are tight but the company is moving swiftly from dealers to consumer sales which are almost three times are profitable.  \n\nRumbleOn CEO Marshall Chesrown said “We are pleased with the progress we are making” going on to add “We continue to expect an acceleration in unit and revenue growth in the first half of 2020”.   \n\nThe company is a high risk development stage nano cap with dilution being more of a certainty than a risk.  However its fast growth suggests it is resonating well with users and, if it is even slightly successful in winning a small share of the huge vehicle sales market, current stock holders should do very well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Follow\" me if you would like to be informed of updates during the week.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everyone.  Some of the stocks mentioned are risky small cap and/or highly speculative.  Please do your own research.",

      "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 20th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings will decide whether the market continues to hit new highs after another week of records  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/earnings-will-decide-whether-market-continues-to-hit-new-highs.html)**\n*****\n&gt; With the Chinese trade deal out of the way, earnings could be the biggest driver for stocks in the week ahead, as big tech, financial, consumer and industrial companies report.\n*****\n&gt; So far, the early rush of earnings are beating estimates at a pace of about 70%. Just a few dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report in the four-day trading week, including IBM Tuesday and Intel on Thursday. Johnson &amp; Johnson reports Wednesday; Procter &amp; Gamble is Thursday, and American Express releases results Friday. The stock market is closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump travels to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum, where he speaks Tuesday. With the China trade deal signed this past Wednesday, strategists say they are now watching for any signs of a bigger trade row brewing between the U.S. and Europe.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports, including existing home sales Wednesday; leading indicators Thursday, and the Markit PMI data for manufacturing and services on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; But it’s earnings, where investors will take the pulse of corporate America, and decide whether forward guidance is justifying the stock market’s record highs and price earnings ratio of more than 18.5. The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 2% in the past week, its best week since August. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,329 Friday and is now up about 3% since the start of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow and Nasdaq also ended the week at new highs. The Dow ended up 1.9% for the week, at 29,348. The Nasdaq rose 2.3% in the past week, ending at 9,388.\n*****\n&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse, said the fourth quarter could be a turning point for earnings, after a poor performance in 2019. So far, earnings are down about 0.8% this quarter, based on actual releases and estimates, according to Refinitiv. If not for the drag from energy companies, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies would have been 1.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; “2019 was a year of lousy earnings, and the fourth quarter is the end of a lousy year,” said Golub. “I think earnings surprises will be fine, but what the real story here is, it looks like magically the 2020 numbers are going to be much, much stronger than 2019.”\n*****\n&gt; Golub said there are two big themes this earnings season. “The first one is tech-related companies. Many of the mega caps had okay earnings, but their margins were under a lot of pressure and it subtracted earnings growth in 2019. Those trends are supposed to reverse. So what was a negative because of easy comps becomes a positive,” Golub said. “The same thing with the energy sector which was a disaster in terms of earnings growth in 2019.”\n*****\n&gt; He said the market rally can continue in part because investors are not yet on board with the earnings story.\n*****\n&gt; “While everybody is looking at the fourth quarter, I think they’re not really reading the right script, and the script they should be reading was this was the last quarter where tech margins and energy sector headwinds are overwhelming the market,” he said.\n*****\n&gt; The hearings on Trump’s impeachment are so far ignored by markets and will be underway in the Senate. While the market continues to shrug it off, traders are monitoring the situation for any change in tone.\n*****\n&gt; “Will there be new evidence/witnesses at the Senate trial to make it politically significant?,” wrote Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Alan Ruskin. “Let’s not forget that for many voters, the President seems to be the main motivator for voters on both sides of the political spectrum — for and against. This argument runs along the lines that Trump is running against himself/‘the anti-Trump’, and, the election will be heavily impacted by which Democrat candidate least impacts the ‘anti-Trump’ vote — a view that some argue tends to support centrists like Biden.”\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7YCrtpo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9jQCYRG.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXureFC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/3upRv6z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O07l30Z.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BjiCdpH.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/w5fgr9y.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/L81ewyy.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vroSSfA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MMO35Qf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/dCxJl8u.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading Mixed since 1998, But Improving Lately\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 22 years since, the market’s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.79% by DJIA to 0.14% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last eight years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef3ff1e52532ea69e189a7cd90e7b27/bf3ce263396269e9-14/s500x750/4fc5ea153df07c1e2ab94f583409f214f2eae3c6.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Closer Look At Election Years\n\n&gt; 2020 is off to a roaring start, picking up right where 2019 left off. Many investors are eyeing the upcoming presidential election as an impending storm for the stock market. In the four-year presidential cycle, pre-election years have tended to be the strongest for stocks, as sitting presidents have taken measures to boost the economy and stock market higher to garner votes. It sure worked out well last year, with the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 31% total return.\n\n&gt; Returns in election years, however, have been quite bifurcated.\n\n&gt; “If an incumbent president was up for reelection, stocks tended to do extremely well,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “On the other hand, if there was a lame duck president in office, returns were quite muted.”\n\n&gt; Note that a “lame duck president” means the sitting president either isn’t running for reelection or has already fulfilled the maximum two terms. It makes sense, as the president could be less motivated to do things to heat up the economy if they know they are leaving office. Possibly, investors may also get cold feet knowing a change is coming. The S&amp;P 500 was down in 2000 and 2008, and the sitting president was a “lame duck president” both years.\n\n&gt; In the LPL Chart of the Day, we break down election years by whether the president was running for reelection or a lame duck. The chart shows the S&amp;P 500 up an impressive 11.7% on average if the President was running for reelection, compared to up an average of 2.4% if president was a “lame duck president”.\n\n&gt; Given most presidents who have run a second time have tended to win, this could be the market’s way of saying it is comfortable with the status quo over change.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another encouraging historical trend is that the S&amp;P 500 hasn’t been lower during an election year with an incumbent president up for reelection since 1940. To be clear, stocks have been up during election years when the incumbent president actually lost. In 1980, the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 26%, but Jimmy Carter still lost to Ronald Reagan. In other words, this does support the notion of higher stocks in 2020, but higher stocks can’t always tell you who will win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Q4 Earnings Season is All About 2020\n\n&gt; Fourth quarter earnings season kicked off this week with 24 S&amp;P 500 Index companies slated to report results. Our expectations are for a marginal increase in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis, based on current FactSet consensus estimates (-2% year over year) and the average historical upside of roughly 3 percentage points.\n\n&gt; We’ve become accustomed to meager earnings growth. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if fourth quarter results are anywhere near expectations, 2019 will end up as a year with S&amp;P 500 returns of more than 30% and no corporate earnings growth to speak of. That means expanding stock valuations drove the market’s gains last year, a trend we do not expect to continue.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Earnings-blog-011520-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; “We expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “With valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.”\n\n&gt; Accordingly, the key to this reporting season will be whether the optimistic growth outlook reflected in consensus earnings estimates for this year remains intact after companies issue guidance. Many companies will be commenting on 2020 for the first time. Our estimate of $175 per share in S&amp;P 500 EPS for the entire year represents a 6–7% increase from our $165 forecast for 2019. Based on the latest consensus estimates, that growth rate may get pushed up a bit. We still think $175 is attainable if capital investment picks up after stalling last year and wage growth remains stable.\n\n&gt; Trade progress may help. The United States and China will sign the phase-one trade deal later today. While negotiations on the next phase will be tougher and could even stall out, businesses would welcome the additional clarity that de-escalation can provide, something that clearly weighed on corporate profits last year.\n\n*****\n\n# January Off To Stronger Than Usual Start – But 2nd Half Is Weaker\n\n&gt; Stocks are off to a stronger that usual so far in January 2020 when compared in the chart above to the average performance over the most recent 21-year period. As of today’s close DJIA is up 1.41%, S&amp;P 500 +1.61%, NASDAQ leads the pack +3.11% and the Russell 2000 was in the red until the past two days and is now up 0.44%. This is well above historical average performance in recent Januarys.\n\n&gt; The market was up nicely today until reports hit the newswires at about 1:30 pm ET creating uncertainty that the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed tomorrow between the US and China may be pabulum. The realization that the tariffs on Chinese goods may remain in place until after the election as the review process runs its course drove stocks lower this afternoon. The market gave back most of its early gains with only the Dow and Russell 2000 eking out gains today.\n\n&gt; However, as you can see in the dotted lines so far in 2020 the indices are tracking the last 21-years rather closely. If the pattern continues to pan out this year, look for a little strength over the next two days. Then weakness has been prone to appear just after mid-month after the eleventh trading day with mild average losses from on or around the eleventh trading day to the fourteenth trading day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2f102c5c61bd803b4bc407e8c4812e3/1b34c8a8e7ad3e39-e9/s500x750/829ff7ea82b52109b737d17e4b24cb0a4d28e434.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Jackpot for Stocks\n\n&gt; Solid across the board gains this year have put another January Trifecta Jackpot in our sights for 2020. So far our January Trifecta is two for two. Our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system came in positive up 0.7% on January 8 following up on a positive reading for our Santa Claus Rally (SCR) on January 3. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month’s end.\n\n&gt; We just published an update on The Incredible January Barometer: Only 11 Major Errors in 82 Years that runs through the reasons behind the efficacy of the January. We discuss how the passage of the Twentieth “Lame Duck” Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 created the January Barometer. We also compare the January Barometer results along with the full year results, the following eleven months results, and the subsequent twelve months results to all other “Monthly Barometers” using the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite\n\n&gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table below). In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing “Last 11 Mon” years, in the table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 –19.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.\n\n&gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain decent. Of the last 10 times since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.\n\n&gt; A positive SCR and FFD are encouraging and further clarity will be gained when the January Barometer (page 16, 2020 Stock Trader’s Almanac) reports at month’s end. A positive January Barometer would certainly boost prospects for full-year 2020. The December Low Indicator (2020 STA, page 34) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow’s December Closing Low of 27502.81 on 12/3/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1bcaf64028a60761e27f90b96cd50a5/be57098a98452149-c8/s500x750/8bde32d516bf2811adabb784ab6de926796ad504.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equities Closing In On A Breakout\n\n&gt; Below is a chart of the Bloomberg World Equity Market index, which is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 publicly listed companies around the world (including the US). While the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 15% from its January 2018 high, it's notable that we still haven't seen equities break out on a global scale. As shown, the Bloomberg World Index is now just a hair below its prior all-time highs (22 basis points to be exact).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-BBG-World.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-SP-5-years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Three Months And Counting Since Last 1% Decline\n\n&gt; It has now been over three months since the S&amp;P 500's last decline of 1% or more back on 10/9. While it seems like an eternity, the current streak of 67 trading days is nowhere near any sort of record on either a long or short-term basis. The chart below shows historical streaks without a decline of 1%+ for the S&amp;P 500 dating back to 1928. The record for the longest streak was back in 1963 when the S&amp;P 500 went 174 trading days - a full eight months - without a 1% drop. Even more impressive is the fact that in both the 1950s and 1960s there were numerous streaks of 100 or more days. For a decade that is looked back on as one with a lot of upheaval in the US, the 1960s was a period of relative calm for the equity market.\n\n&gt; More recently, the current streak of 67 trading days doesn't look all that impressive relative to streaks we saw back in 2017 and 2018. Right after the election in 2016 and into March of 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had a 109-day streak without a 1% decline, and then from late 2017 through January 2018, there was another streak of 112 trading days without a 1% drop. Even in October 2018, there was another streak of 74 trading days. In other words, in just the last three years there have been three longer streaks without a 1% decline than the current one. In the S&amp;P 500's history, there have been 26 other streaks that have been as long or longer than the current one, and half of those went on to last at least 100 trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011420-Streaks-Without-a-1-Percent-Decline.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 17th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$TAL** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$TEAM** \n&gt; * **$KMI** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SWKS** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$MBWM** \n&gt; * **$TXN** \n&gt; * **$COF** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$UNP** \n&gt; * **$AMTD** \n&gt; * **$FNB** \n&gt; * **$SBNY** \n&gt; * **$RCI** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$STM** \n&gt; * **$AUB** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$BKR** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$NAVI** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$APH** \n&gt; * **$NTRS** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$TER** \n&gt; * **$ZION**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/cCUTW9b.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/HZqsu6j.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

They're the only one with that capability.\n\nThey've been around for like 2-3 years now, but they have been laying groundwork during that time, building a team, etc. They have one building in operation in Canada. It just went to 24/7 operation 5 days a week. They have a few more buildings opening up in latter 2020. One in Germany and two more in Canada. Final production will be hundreds of thousands of kilograms a year. Stock is at about 27 cents per share now. I know that generally \"penny stocks\" are looked down on. This company used to be at like $1.50+ per share. It went down as people became frustrated due to the company literally just starting out then. \n\nThis past fiscal quarter, the company turned its first official profit because they were focusing more on producing instead of just laying ground work and building. They were processing $20+ million in biomass. It was about 1.2 million dollars of earnings for this past fiscal quarter, if I remember correctly.

I'm fairly new to technical analysis, but I have recently been learning the basics to it. I'm considering taking my first turbo position tomorrow on the stock PostNL (PNL) and would like your opinion on it. I'll run my thoughts down for you here:\n\nThe stock's had a fairly rough 2019, plummeting from 2.5 to 1.4 between May and June. I've done my fundamental DD on it, since I was also invested in it for its recovery to 2.0 in the few months after that. Recently PNL has plummeted again due to some bad merger news. In my personal analysis I have concluded that the company is worth a lot more than the current cap of 885M (euro's) because, among other things that I won't get into here, it's the only postal delivery service in my entire country (The Netherlands) and has a fairly stable income in a growing industry.\n\nFor the technical side: I'm considering the stock, because i saw a series of red candles with an inverted hammer at the end. In the little knowledge of TA i have this could mean that the stock is going to bounce back. The RSI is also fairly deep into oversold territory (about 20 at the moment).\n\nI'm considering buying a 5x leveraged turbo (\"Postnl BNP turbo long 1.57) IF the stock opens positively tomorrow, possible confirming a reversal and an uptrend. My goal would be around the 2 euro's mark and my stoploss would be at around 1.69. This equals a ratio of about 3:1 regarding profit/loss.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? If anyone with more experience thinks I'm being ridiculous, please let me know ;). I'm open to all comments. Thanks in advance!",

Ag has high upside when producers can maximize efficiency, find production equilibrium with supply needs through economies of scale (which allows for fewer producers to need to play and those producers increase the size of their enterprise). But in order to really make economies of scale advantageous, it requires mechanized help. \n\nJohn Deere tractors are your flagship tractor. When you think of tractors, the green with yellow accented behemoths tilling those fields are probably the first that come to mind. But what happens when farmers begin to look at secondary markets to satiate their equipment needs when the producer of their prized equipment no longer is working with their customers to meet their needs? \n\n[Newer models can run upwards of $300,000 for a rig](https://www.fastline.com/farm-equipment-for-sale/listings/john-deere-tractors/results?category=Tractors&amp;manufacturer=John+Deere&amp;minprice=220000&amp;page=1) even on the used market. Why pay $200,000+ for a machine that you could buy for $30,000 thats 40 years old? In fact, farmers are turning to these older machines because they are less complicated to fix. But the demand for those older models are actually driving up the prices in the secondary markets because sellers realize how valuable their old machines are becoming. \n\nJohn Deere tractors are becoming more technologically advanced, but this may not be a good thing. Deere is raising the prices of their machines, and making it such that farmers are looking to used markets to find older machines. If you’ve ever worked on an old car, you can think of it in the same manner—the older tractors are very barebones and mainly mechanical. If you understand how to repair the machine, it’s a fairly straightforward process. \n\nNot only is the upfront cost a factor when it comes to investing in one of these machines, but maintenance repairs is a contributing factor. These newer machines have technological locks built into the operating systems that limit private owners from performing their own repairs on the machine, forcing them to contact the dealership, have them send out a mechanic representative at the dealerships convenience, potentially holding up production for extended periods of time. This puts the farmer’s operations at a reduced level unnecessarily, and at a greater cost, than what they normally would repair themselves.\n\nDue to this, farmers have found an outside solution to this roadblock Deere corporate has put in place to lock the technology systems of the machines: [Ukrainian software hacks.](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware). [October of 2016, buyers were required to sign a licensing agreement forbidding the repair and modification of farming equipment.](https://www.deere.com/privacy_and_data/docs/agreement_pdfs/english/2016-10-28-Embedded-Software-EULA.pdf)\n\nIs John Deere alienating one of its leading sales segments? With international trade agreements being formed, amended and expanded—soybean, grain and corn is going to be in great demand. Farmers are going to need equipment that fulfills their operations, small or large scale. These new equipment prices, in addition to prices to maintain the machines, are going to be passed onto consumers, ultimately driving up prices for some of our most common goods. Why pay more than you have to for a machine today when one three decades old can be refurbished and folded into operation for significantly less cost? \n\nAccording to their financial statements, FY 2019 revenue was the first year since FY 2014 that it was greater. Bringing in $39.26B in 2019, 8.9% greater than the second highest year this decade in FY 2014 at $36.02B. $DE’s brought in a net profit of $3.25B in FY 2019, up 2.8% from FY 2014. FY 2015-2018 all showed negative growth from the peak in 2014 if omitting 2019 data. \n\nWith John Deere and Caterpillar ($CAT) being some of the leading manufacturing segments in the United States, is manufacturing at risk if $DE doesn’t change their business model to be more accommodating to their customers? $DE and $CAT are both major construction equipment manufacturers, with Caterpillar leading over Deere in that segment.\n\nFrom John Deere’s financial statements, they revenued $20,511B in Ag sales (84% of total sales), compared to construction at $3,831B (16% of their equipment sales). So clearly, their ag customers will have significant leverage if a portion of them begin to look in the secondary markets for used equipment they can fix themselves, or even if they purchase new equipment, but use this Ukrainian hack to crack the operating systems of their machines and fix it themselves. \n\nWith agriculture being Deere’s most prominent segment, if they don’t begin to accommodate their farmer customers more carefully, $DE could begin to face sales pressures in the next coming years. The commodities will be needed to be farmed with or without Deere, so will they bend the knee? Or continue in an adverse customer-producer relationship that ultimately may hurt the company. If Deere doesn’t change their business model, they may eventually price themselves out of the market.\n\nTL; DR: if John Deere doesn’t start making efforts to work with the customers as opposed to trying to squeeze every penny out of them.",

The idea of owners selling their shares being a red flag. It does seem intuitive.\n\nAnd there's been examples in the past. Mark Cuban broadcast.com etc.\n\nBut how often does the reverse happen?

I've done some research on the stock market to get a general idea of different trading strategies. In everyones opinion, what is the best way to get the absolute most bang for your buck for long term investing (25+ years)?\n\nI am stuck between choosing these 3 different strategies:\n\n1. Opening a Roth IRA and investing in only a total market ETF and Mutual fund and MAYBE investing 10-20% of my portfolio in 1-3 tops blue chip stocks (AAPL, V, MSFT for example)\n\n2. Having a taxable stock account where I invest half of my portfolio in a blue chip stock when it dips and then selling it when it shoots up e.g. BA right now, AND a Roth IRA for the other half of my portfolio with a total market index fund (looking at VTI) and/or mutual fund.\n\n3. Investing in 10-20 low risk blue chip stocks in a Roth IRA for 50% of my portfolio and the other 50% of my Roth IRA in a total market mutual and/or ETF.\n\nOption number 2 clearly has the most risk involded but possibly the most reward if executed rationally? What strategies does everyone else employ that work for them? Any tips or suggestions on strategies, stocks, ETFs and Mutual funds would be helpful. Again, I've done a fair share of research but am still newb.\n\nI should also add that:\n -I currently make 28,000 a year\n -My salary (fingers crossed) SHOULD\n  increase by 10-20 thousand this next   \n  year if all goes well with getting a new\n  position in the laborers union and then \n  slowly increase each year after that.\n- I currently have 6,000 to start investing.\n-In a few months I will be completely debt free and be able to devote 50-60% of my earnings towards investing.",

For all of Boeing’s business coups and innovation, one stark statistic has come to symbolize the company’s priorities: Over the past six years, Boeing spent $43.4 billion on stock buybacks, compared with $15.7 billion on research and development for commercial airplanes. The board even approved an additional $20 billion buyback in December 2018, less than two months after the first 737 Max crash, though it subsequently shelved that plan. \n\nBut the fallout from the Max crisis may well push Boeing in the opposite direction. Costs related to the Max have topped $9 billion and could easily double. To shore up its balance sheet Boeing is reportedly considering borrowing money to pay shareholder dividends—and cutting R&amp;D spending. Those are steps in the wrong direction, says Epstein. The only way forward is to put investors’ short-term interests on hold, he argues: “If you don’t do that—if you cut R&amp;D, cost-cut, give cash to shareholders—then you’re playing with Boeing’s future.” ",

Minor losses I know, but as there's no apparent run up for FDA approval and the price is being heavily controlled, I'm starting to get angsty that approval is now priced in and the market makers are trying to screw everyone with options higher than $4 in Feb. as they know the price is fixed. I feel like they're going to drop the price further closer to the approval date to shake loose hands, if Twirla is approved there will be a pop premarket to around $5, market makers and premarket traders will make their money, price will drop back to around $3 and anyone that bought at the $2.90 mark will be screwed once the market opens for a low gain.\n\n\nWe're less than a month from the approval date and the price action on this stock has been so fishy I'm starting to get really edgy about it and considering taking a small loss than risking it. \n\n\nI've 1500ish share @2.85.",

In the above example lets say you lost -$50K with the same stock or similar priced stock, but with your other trades you made $10K in profits for the year. If a wash sale NEGATES your capital losses, wouldnt that essentially mean you made $60K in GAINS for the year and must pay taxes on that amount even though you're actually down -$40K gross profits?\n\nOr what if you made $20K in gains and -$10K worth of wash sales? Do you get taxed on $30K in capital gains since the wash sale rule negates the -$10K as a loss?\n\nAnd how about if you consistently re-enter a stock everyday but instead of losing money each time, you profit everytime you re-enter sell and repeat.

You can just plug in a stock like MSFT into the search box and it'll pull reports from like Argus.  Kind of cool to see their perspective and ratings and how they build portfolios.\n\nLast tab, Investment Ideas will help you generate ideas based on filters  such as, Bullish and Bearish, Technical or Fundamental Analysis,  Sectors, Short, Medium, Long Term holding and Buy, Hold, or Sell  Ratings.   I like this the most as you can play around with filters and gets some of ideas of stocks to want to add to your watch list.  I'd never just blindly follow analysis of course so definitely make your own investment decisions and do your own research.\n\nTo sum up, I personally don't think it is worth $34.99 a month or $349.99 annually.

With the rising equity value, everyboy feel rich and they use that appreciation to buy rising price houses, etc. \n\nWhat happens if there is a long. hard correction? These employees will get wiped out 20-30% of their annual salary. This never happened before (employees get compensated mostly in stock). The snow ball effect will be devastasting. Companies won't be able to switch back to normal compensation. Yes they can lay off and reward employees w more stocks but employees will turn around and sell it rightaway w fear that they will loose value. Again, this type of dynamic didn't happen before.

The rule has faced a number of courtroom challenges that so far have prevented it from going into effect. Now, a handful of tech companies have signed [an amicus brief filing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (PDF)](https://assets-wp.boundless.com/uploads/2020/01/Public-charge-amicus-for-Boundless-et-al-CA4-FINAL.pdf), putting their public weight behind rescinding the rule.    \n\nThose companies argue that the rule will prevent them from hiring the talent they need. From the filing:\n\n&gt;“American businesses depend upon an efficient immigration system to ensure that they have access to the talent that they need to grow and succeed. Although the American-citizen workforce is highly skilled, businesses sometimes benefit by hiring foreign nationals for certain positions, often sponsoring these workers for permanent residency. Immigration law has long recognized that, in such circumstances, businesses require pathways (such as H-1B and L-1 visas adjusted to 5 employment-based permanent residency) for foreign nationals to come to and remain in the United States to work… The Rule, however, would restrict American businesses’ ability to hire foreign-born workers, because, under the Rule, many skilled workers who would otherwise have been eligible for permanent residency would now be barred from receiving it.”\n\nIn other words, these companies feel that the rule is too broad: “Given the numerous and amorphous factors—and the unfettered discretion given to immigration officials—virtually any applicant could be found to have some basis for a denial.”\n\nfrom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://insights.dice.com/2020/01/21/low-income-immigrants-rule-microsoft-push-back/](https://insights.dice.com/2020/01/21/low-income-immigrants-rule-microsoft-push-back/)",

I am just putting out next week's most anticipated earnings calendar a day earlier than usual due to not being able to get around to do this tomorrow or this weekend.

Admittedly, I did not get a chance to confirm all the companies that are on this week's calendar are actually reporting, but if you see something that doesn't look right, as far as a company that is listed up on this calendar on a particular day that isn't expected to report, please just post a little notice in this thread so that everyone is made aware of it!

I met with my dad's financial planner (a person who works at Allianz--the same place where he has this annuity), but I feel this is a conflict of interest on their end and I'm not comfortable with this, which is why I'm here. My understanding is that I either leave the full amount in the annuity or take the full amount out and pay taxes and possibly a penalty on it. Does that sound correct? If I do take it out, I'd like to invest it in a mix of growth stocks and dividends.   \n\n\nWhat would you do in this situation? ...Is there any way that I can pull out the funds and reinvest them into a \"like\" product without paying a penalty or taxes?  \n\n\nThank you again for your time.",

      "selftext": "Hello friends,\n\nFirst off as the title states I think there will be a correction in the near future. Take this with a grain of salt but this is only my opinion but we have multiple bubbles brewing. I always advise dollar cost averaging but I would also recommend holding a healthy amount of cash. Now I am leaning towards cash because the market is strange to say the least. \n\nWhen the correction happens, it will be catastrophic. I know it will impact everyone but I believe it will hit millennials and 60+ the hardest. \n\nBelow are the bubbles I see:\n\n60+ effects: Health care costs: Health care inflation rates have outpaced wages for decades. This will affect everyone but mostly older adults because it is the time in their lives that they typically need care. A larger and larger % of their money is dedicated to costs each year. Why is this bad? As elderly run low on money more and more will slip into poverty. This takes money out of the market/economy, and will begin to stress the medical system, especially Medicaid which is gradually lowering benefits.  As Medicaid begins to fail/reduce benefits/reduce payout the medical institutions will have to learn to recoup cost from another source, AKA the rest of us not using the services. Combine this with the exploding aging demographic the current infrastructure is in danger. The premiums for the average family are already over 1200$ per month, + whatever deductible, + plus bullshit out of network expenses. To me this is the scariest bubble we have over the next 2 decades. \n\nHousing: effects millennials and 60+: How does this effect both? Home prices have also been outpacing inflation consistently. On top of this the average new home built is significantly larger and more expensive. This restricts a lot of new home buyers (typically age 25-35) from entering the real estate market. Homes have historically been one of the primary sources of family’s net wealth as they age (equity grows via inflation/down payment). On top of this because younger adults are being restricted from buying homes they are forced to rent, which further delays them because rentals all over the country have also been steadily increasing in rates. Meaning younger adults are losing out on years of a crucial long-term investment. Here is the kicker though, many adults retiring were expecting to sale their homes and downsize. This process of transferring wealth potential to younger generations is eliminated because the younger generation does not have the money. Now the retiring adults are stuck with a home with higher expenses, until they can sale at a rate lower than they expected. \n\nSchool debt: This will effect mostly younger adults &lt;35: This basically builds on the two above. National student loan debt is close to $1.5 T (T = TRILLION). Young adults with an education are typically defined as the middle class because with the education they have higher earning potential. Due to the increasing student loan debt many are unable to take the “risks” and “opportunities” the older generations could afford to take. Student loan debt not only restrict them from homes, but it also delays many from investing in the markets long term. Which is devasting long term if you invested 500$ monthly at 8% for 30 years starting at 0 you have 750k$ if you had 40 years of growth it is $1.75M that is a 1,000,000 difference……. Basically, the demographic which would typically support the economy/market is being severely limited. I WILL CAVEAT THIS if you go or went to school for a degree which had no earning potential and came out with massive debt I am sorry, but that was just stupid on so many fronts on your part, and mostly your fault.\n\nOil: Effects everyone: Our global economy is based on oil. Oil is already struggling due to demand being too low and supply too high. As global sentiment continues to decrease towards the industry and new innovative technology is released to replace oil the demand will further deteriorate. What is going to happen is the big companies like OXY, EXXON, BP, CHEVRON, etc will survive and absorb some smaller entities. However, many of the less profitable sectors will erode leaving ghost towns and 100,000 of thousands of people out of work. The industry that takes its place will be a shell of itself. Cities across the country are already starting to ban 1-time use plastics.\n\nWages: effects all: Combine all the above with wages being stagnant over the past decade. \n\nYet again take my advice with a grain of salt: However, we are now in the longest bull market in history with unprecedented growth. Which is why I am invested in cash, total market index funds, and individual stocks with a strong dividend.\n\nTLDR: medical sector, student debt, homes prices have been increasing and hinder growth, major market players being disrupted, wages stagnant all lead to an economy which is not going to be sustainable long term.\nIll edit grammatical erros tomorrow when I wake up, wrote this in response to an article stating they don’t understand the current market surge.",

(CNBC)\n* Dow stock Intel (INTC) was rising 5% in premarket trading after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit and revenue after the bell Thursday.

The Wall Street Journal reported that law enforcement will begin identifying cases immediately and “seek all available statutory authorities to pursue civil fines and other penalties against these entities.”\n* J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon got a 1.6% raise to $31.5 million for his work in 2019 after his bank posted record earnings and shares of the company surged.

(CNBC)\n* The U.S. government announced that former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf has been banned from ever working at a bank again and will pay $17.5 million for scandals in which millions of fake accounts were set up to meet sales quotas. Regulators plans to target other individuals, including former executives, for their role in the scandals.

      "selftext": "**Value Stocks (Bed Bath and Beyond, Subaru and Express)**\n\nBarron’s round table last weekend highlighted a couple of interesting opportunities, namely Bed Bath and Beyond and Subaru. \n\nAfter years of poor performance, that has seen the stock price fall by 80%, **Bed Bath and Beyond** ($BBBY) appointed a new CEO Mark Tritton in October last year.  Mr Tritton has an outstanding track record, having previously helped turn around Target and Nordstrom.  His speciality is improving merchandise and reducing the cost of private label.  \n\nThat’s particularly relevant for Bed Bath who have seen their margins fall to just 3%.  If Mr Tritton does what he’s demonstrably good at and implements better sourcing, cost-cutting, and sales growth -- then margins could double, earnings should grow to about $4 to $5 a share and the stock could rise from $16.35 on Friday to $45 or higher.\n\nThat sounds very achievable on paper.  However, what makes it more interesting is that Mr Tritton is backing himself with an equity heavy package.  Instead of looking for cash he has taken $1 million - $2 million in cash with the remaining $8 million - $10 million in stock.  That means his interests are aligned with stockholders and that he sees upside in owning shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso highlighted by Barron’s was **Subaru** ($FUJHY).  Subaru is one of the lowest-cost car producers and yet one of the most profitable, with 9% margins. \n\nIts stock is very cheap (trading at nine times next year’s earnings, with a 5.4% dividend yield and 30% cash-to-market cap) because the market is concerned that volumes are about to peak.  However the economics look good.  Subaru’s cars are taking more market share (4% in the US) and consumers are shifting to sport utility vehicles which cost more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nElsewhere, clothing retailer **Express** ($EXPR) shares jumped 20% on Wednesday following plans to shutter 100 stores by 2022.  The move is expected to cut costs by $80 million and boost profits by $15 million annually.  Additionally,  over the same period, operating lease obligations are expected to drop by $85 million. \n\nThese are both significant amounts for Express and should provide a significant boost to its $80 million trailing EBITDA.\n\nIt’s no surprise then that the stock price rose 20%.  However Express’ valuation still looks incredibly cheap -- even after the increase. Its enterprise value is just $142 million with a market cap of $309 million, $167 million of cash and no debt the enterprise value. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Growth Stocks (Ollie’s Bargain Outlet and eHealth)**\n\n**Ollie’s Bargain Outlet** ($OLLI) shares hit a 52 week low on Tuesday before rebounding.  However, as of Friday’s close, the stock was still down 40% from the all time highs set in May last year. \n\nI am not surprised the stock is rebounding.  The company had a bad start to the year in Q1 and Q2 as poorly-timed inventory decisions led to an excess of out of season goods and rapid expansion led to some cannibalization of sales.  However Management’s assurances that set backs were temporary proved to be true as strong Q3 results in December beat expectations. Net sales increased 15.3%, operating income increased 22.0%, adjusted net income increased 28.3% and the company reaffirmed full year guidance.\n\nLonger term, the potential for growth is very good. The company has 345 stores in 23 states and plans to increase its store count nationally to over 950.\n\nThe stock is currently trading on 26x trailing earnings. That looks cheap for a fast growing “off price” retailer with big plans that is (once more) executing well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShares of **eHealth** ($EHTH) jumped 27% on Friday after the online health exchange provider announced that preliminary Q4 revenue will be between $257.5 million and $259.5 million with earnings between $53 million and $55 million (c.$2.34 per share).  Consensus estimates were for Q4 revenue of  $194.9 million and EPS of $2.15. \n\nBusiness is picking up for eHealth and the trend seems likely to continue.  An ageing U.S. population, with the 65+ population expected to increase from 40 million in 2010 to 80 million in 2030, will mean more people buying private health insurance to enhance Medicare for decades to come.  Additionally, its likely that those purchases will be made increasing online, where eHealth has established itself as a leader in a very fragmented market.\n\nThe stock is priced on 50x 2019 estimates but with 50% growth and a bright outlook the valuation looks very reasonable.\n\neHealth CEO Scott Flanders said, \"We remain excited about the Medicare market opportunity and significant growth potential ahead of us and are looking forward to sharing our outlook for 2020 as part of our fourth-quarter earnings release next month.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pharmaceuticals (TherapeuticMD)**\n\n**TherapeuticMD** ($TXMD), a commercial-stage biopharma focused on women's health, jumped over 20% on Tuesday after it was reported that JP Morgan had taken a 7% shareholding.  \n\nThe company has three drugs on the market (Imvexxy, Bijuva and Annovera) with combined peak annual sales estimated at $1.85 billion.  Be that as it may, TXMD is still in the early stages of building demand with trailing revenues of just $40 million.  \n\nThe investment by JPM is important as the company burns through its $155 million of cash and investors look for signs that management is capable of delivering commercially.  Reassuringly JPM’s move follows recent purchases in the past six months of $300,000 by the CEO and $400,000 by the company President.\n\nConsiderable risks remain with TherapeuticMD and its plans to develop commercial sales.  However, I would say that with a market cap of $672 million compared to forecast peak sales of $1.85 million, the rewards should significantly outweigh the risks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Follow\" me if you would like to receive updates during the week.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everyone.  Some of the stocks mentioned are risky small cap and/or highly speculative.  Please do your own research.",

      "selftext": "# Introduction\n\nMy background; three years of work experience in the financial services industry for a large global firm in the area of asset management. My role is centred around financial statement analysis and basically, just due diligence into the fundamentals of a company. \n\nAnyways, the reason I decided to write up this guide for /r/stocks is that I frequent the subreddit quite often and although there are a few good posters here and there, it seems there is a lot of misinformation that goes around, and thus, I wanted to set out a foundation for a due diligence template that new investors can use so that they can have some sort of basic guideline in terms of what to look out for before buying or selling a stock.\n\n---\n\n# 1) What does the company do?\n\nStep number uno; figure out what the company does. This is where google is your friend. Simply type up the company's name or ticker into google and read what it is they do.\n\nIf you don't understand what it is the company actually does after looking through google, don't invest.\n\nIf the company deals with complicated business models that require technical knowledge which you don't have, for example; an early-stage biotech undertaking Phase II clinical trials, don't invest.\n\nIf the company is vague about what it does or you're using google translator to read their business description, don't invest.\n\nGenerally, the more complicated the business model of the company, the riskier it is to invest. This includes conglomerates that may be involved in many simple business ventures individually, but when bunched up all together, it becomes complicated to analyse and thus, the risk to invest increases (e.g. GE -- to this day, I still think no one knows what they actually do).\n\nSo you're probably wondering by now, what is all this talk about *risk*? Don't worry about that for now, we will get to it later I promise.\n\n# 2) News\n\nIn other words, what is currently happening with the company? There is no point wasting your time to research on further sections of your due diligence process if the company has publicly stated its intentions to file for bankruptcy.\n\nContrary to step 1, this is where google might not to be your friend. There tends to be a lot of spam articles, advertisements or just plain misinformation on google news. Normally, I just spend a minute on google news before doing some more serious research on better news site such as [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) (again, simply search the company name).\n\nDo not slack off here. The easiest way to lose money is to buy into a stock when litigations or liquidity concerns are going on which you could had easily avoid with a few minutes of reading the news.\n\nAnother reason why the news is important is that it can tell you things that aren't on the financial statements. What you read on the news can and 99% will impact the subsequent steps of this guide i.e., financial statement analysis.\n\n\n\n# 3) Revenue drivers\n\nHow does the company make money?\n\nRevenue is the second most important thing on a company's financial statements.\n\nIf you're going to read only one thing on a company's financials (which I seriously suggest you do not do), then that one thing should be revenue.\n\nNow, I'm not going to go into too much detail of why revenue is important. That's not the purpose of this guide, I'm not here to teach undergrad finance.\n\nEssentially, just imagine I'm offering you to buy my lemonade stand. Now ask yourself *how you should go abouts* figuring out how much you should pay for the lemonade stand. If you don't know the answer to this, read up on the [time value of money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp) and [discounted cash flows](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp).\n\nAnyways, let's move on. Revenue can be found on the first line item in a company's income statement. The breakdown of revenue (i.e., the drivers) can be found in the segment reporting section of the financial statements (just ctrl+f and look for 'segment').\n\nA quick sense check I like to do here before doing anything else is revenue growth over market cap growth for the most recent period (use excel).\n\nIf market cap growth is outpacing revenue growth, that's already a bad sign. Keep in mind that it's not an absolute indicator you should steer away, but it's just a quick and dirty calculation that gives you a general idea of where the stock is at in the market.\n\nThe two common reasons for why market cap growth is outpacing revenue growth is either that the stock is overvalued or that the market is predicting exponential revenue growth (i.e., revenue growth in the future should outpace this period's market cap growth).\n\nNext, let's figure out the revenue drivers.\n\nMost companies will have multiples revenue streams relating to different business operations, thus, it is important to figure out which one of those streams are driving revenue and by how much -- revenue stream divided by total revenue.\n\nThen, we look at the growth of each revenue stream over the most recent periods. Simply looking at revenue on its own is useless without looking at growth.\n\nAssuming you have done both of the above and listed them in descending order, you should now be able to determine which ones are the core revenue drivers.\n\nPersonally, I like to use the [BCG Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth%E2%80%93share_matrix) as a guideline when looking at the qualitative nature of the revenue drivers but everyone has their own way of doing things.\n\nIf the company is generating most of its investments from Dogs, that's probably a bad sign.\n\nAgain, I'm not going to go through what each combination of the BCG Matrix means, have a read through the wikipedia as the information is all there.\n\nThis is usually the time when I can determine whether I should spend additional time analysing the company or move onto the next.\n\nIf you proceed, here is where things start getting quantitative and time intensive. \n\n\n\n*Note: In case some of you do not know where to get a company's financial statements, go to the [SEC site](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html). Simply search for the company's name, then search for filling type '10-K'.*\n\n**To be continued in Part 2**",

      "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 27th, 2020.\n\n# **After virus scare, markets look to Fed rate policy to keep stock rally going  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/after-virus-scare-markets-look-to-fed-rate-policy-to-keep-rally-going.html)**\n*****\n&gt; With stocks coming off their first losing week of the year, investors will be looking for the Federal Reserve to soothe markets by reaffirming its position that interest rates will be low for a long time into the future.\n*****\n&gt; The outbreak of the coronavirus in China in the past week took the steam out of a market that has been repeatedly rallying to new highs since December. The S&amp;P 500 fell just about 1% for the week, amid fears the virus could lead to slower growth not only in China, but across the globe.\n*****\n&gt; Those concerns could continue to spook markets in the coming week, but stocks should be buffeted by the Fed’s anticipated commitment to low rates and its current Treasury bill buying program. The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize that the Fed remains on a neutral policy path and that would only change if there was a significant change in the economic outlook.\n*****\n&gt; There are also some major earnings reports, including from Apple, which hit an all-time high Friday morning before closing lower with the broader market. It could have a big impact on sentiment and help influence trading across the technology sector.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, and Treasury yields have been sinking on worries about the new virus. The 10-year yield sunk to a Nov. 1 low of 1.68% and investors drove gold prices higher in a flight-to-safety trade.\n*****\n&gt; “It’s overshadowing everything, and what the market is looking for is that the Chinese are containing it, and the spread is minimal,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The derivative of all of this is what does it do to growth? Traders and investors are hoping the stimulus that has been introduced into the Chinese economy is going to take hold, and this is not going to halt that turnaround.”\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the market has been looking for an excuse to pull back. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,295, off 1%, but it is still up about 2% for the year so far.\n*****\n&gt; “You could see going into the weekend the 10-year Treasury yield is down, gold is higher, the market is in a text book defensive state,” said Krosby. “We had a market that was poised for a bout of profit-taking and this is it.”\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings roll out\n&gt; There are more than 135 S&amp;P companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, with a heavy focus on technology, industrials and consumer stocks. Apple reports Tuesday, and Microsoft and Facebook are Wednesday. Boeing and General Electric report Wednesday, while McDonald’s releases results Wednesday. On Friday, big oil reports with ExxonMobil and Chevron expected.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings reports so far have been mostly better than expected, with 68.2% of companies beating earnings per share estimates, according to Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to be down about a half percent for the fourth quarter, based on actual reports and estimates of companies yet to report.\n*****\n&gt; “Coming into any earnings season with stocks at all time highs is fraught with peril,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s precarious because you have the opportunity for outsized moves if you miss earnings, revenues or guidance.”\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said companies may be able to give a better indication of the future, now that there’s a first phase trade deal between the U.S. and China. He said markets will also be looking for guidance from China and elsewhere on whether the virus appears to be containable or not.\n*****\n&gt;#  Fed is big story but won’t say much\nThe Federal Reserve is not likely to say much has changed in its outlook, except that it’s last three interest rate cuts may have helped the economy and financial conditions.\n*****\n&gt; “The big news is just talk on the balance sheet. I think that’s going to be the key messaging,” said Jim Caron, portfolio strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “I think the data has been okay. There’s really nothing new there. The only thing that’s really new or interesting is going to be what’s going on with the balance sheet.”\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has been buying about $60 billion in Treasury bills each month to expand its balance sheet, ending a program where it was shrinking the balance sheet. The Fed is adding reserves to end a problem in the repo market, which is basically the plumbing of the financial markets where institutions go to get short term cash.\n*****\n&gt; Many traders believe the program is adding liquidity to markets, and therefore driving investors into stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Mark Cabana, head of short rate strategy at BofA Securiteis, said the Fed is not changing its benchmark fed funds target rate, but the fixed income market has been expecting the Fed to make a technical adjustment to another rate. He said the fed funds rate, trading at about 1.55%, has come to the lower end of the Fed’s target range of 1.5 to 1.75%.\n*****\n&gt; For that reason it is likely to raise the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. “The intent is to affirm the bottom end of the Fed’s target range, ” he said.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the technical move, they “may be will provide a little more guidance on what it would take to vote rates one way or the other,” he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Economic data\n&gt; There’s an important data calendar in the coming week, including the first look at the fourth quarter’s gross domestic product on Thursday. Personal income and spending data is Friday, and that includes the personal consumption expenditure inflation deflator, watched by the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; New home sales could continue the string of positive news in housing, when they are released Monday, and there are durable goods Tuesday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Jh9TsGk.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PC0Wzg3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HbDh9Vc.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/mbOqHih.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vvAjRp1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H2E0IGA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EzxkRa0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D9nkFqV.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BhyYBqu.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ueyg2Ui.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xc2z54D.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/mFxq4a0.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XjxVPqW.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/uiduXrQ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February’s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Solid January Starts Not Rare, February Could Be Tepid\n\n&gt; Bullish sentiment is running high and why not. A new decade has begun, January has been bucking the recent trend of volatile performance and the market is trading at or near all-time record highs. Big round numbers like 29000, 3300 and 9000 are also emotionally satisfying. Our Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days indicators were both positive and the market is well on its way to completing a historically bullish January Trifecta. A positive January Barometer is all that remains to complete the January Trifecta.\n\n&gt; As of yesterday’s close DJIA was up 2.3% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was up 2.79% and NASDAQ stood at 4.44%. Although these gains are above average, they are actually not all that uncommon by the thirteenth trading day of the New Year. Since 1901 (119 years), DJIA has been up 2.3% or more on the thirteenth trading day 33 times before this year. DJIA’s largest gain on the thirteenth trading day was 11.4% in 1976 (+17.9% for the full-year). S&amp;P 500 has equaled or exceeded 2.79% on the thirteenth trading day 26 times since 1930 while NASDAQ has bested 4.44% 15 times since 1971. Depending on index, gains equal to or greater than this year come about approximately once every 3.3 to 3.6 years. 2012 was the last election year where all three indexes were up more on the thirteenth trading day than this year.\n\n&gt; In the following Seasonal Patten Charts of DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, we compare 2020 (as of yesterday’s close) to All Years and Election Years. Here it is clear that the market has gotten off to a solid start with well above average gains so far. Throughout 2019, the market tracked its historical patterns quite closely which suggests some mean reversion could occur this February as the month has been historically tepid for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40266be6ec0ea5254acf28b7b6d1382f/9bf6345fd07e4a41-a7/s500x750/adacad5fc51e44798ccb9e3f4f840aeb1cf88bad.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/64ed8994efe5e18c82cdb0e191844380/9bf6345fd07e4a41-00/s500x750/da09894ccf7e9c51f7a3814ee73a4a9e65fefeca.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/71145fa04257eb5aad5eec7945276aa7/9bf6345fd07e4a41-02/s500x750/48e6c017697fc7e130ffcdabcb46093f3c28522b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Another Look At Election Years\n\n&gt; Last week in our LPL Research blog, we took a closer look at how stocks have performed during an election year. We found that since 1940, the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn’t been lower during an election year when an incumbent president has been up for reelection.\n\n&gt; We’ve had many requests to look more into election years, so we thought we’d take another look at this impactful year.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500’s track record for reelection years has been impressive, but its average path during these years has been quite interesting, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. In ten reelection years since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 on average has barely budged from February through June, before breaking out in the second half of the year.\n\n&gt; “Stocks actually have traded in a tight range from February through June during election years, with the big rally taking place during the second half of the year,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reelection-012220.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; From a quarterly view, the S&amp;P 500 has historically posted modest returns in the four quarters of an election year, but the benchmark has been higher an impressive 82% of the time in the fourth quarter of all election years. That’s one of the best track records of any quarter in the four-year presidential cycle.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/quarterly-return-012220.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Recession Watch Update\n\n&gt; As the economic expansion caps its first decade, we thought it’d be a good time to check on LPL Research’s leading indicators in our Recession Watch Dashboard.\n\n&gt; As you can see in our latest update and in the LPL Chart of the Day, the overall view hasn’t changed much. We believe we are in the later stages of this economic expansion, but we still see little threat of imminent recession. The current expansion is the longest on record, at 126 months, but the economy has grown at a slow and steady rate. We believe this measured pace, along with supportive fiscal policy, has contributed to this cycle’s continued durability.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/012120-recession-blog.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; In the fourth quarter, the needle moved in different directions for two of our five forecasters:\n\n&gt; We removed the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve from On Watch status as the spread between the 3-month and 10-year yields moved back into positive territory. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields also climbed to an 18-month high following the Federal Reserve rate cuts. Going back to 1955, a yield curve inversion (long-term yields falling below short-term yields) has preceded each of the nine recessions. It’s important to note, however, that parts of the curve flickered between positive and inverted territory several times before the actual recession occurred.\n\n&gt; We added Market Valuations to On Watch status, as the S&amp;P 500 Index trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio rose near cycle highs. The P/E ratio is now comfortably above our 2020 target of 18.75. With the S&amp;P 500 surpassing the upper end of our year-end fair value target of 3,300, we are watching closely to see if earnings growth is strong enough to justify these elevated valuations. The low interest-rate and inflation environment continue to be strong tailwinds for market valuations.\n\n&gt; “We remain optimistic of continued, albeit possibly slower, economic growth in the United States in the coming year, bolstered by recent progress on the U.S.-China trade deal,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “While we continue to monitor the indicators closely, at the present time, we see only a modest chance of recession starting within the next year.”\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 24th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.26.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$PYPL** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$DHI** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$UTX** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$S** \n&gt; * **$NURO** \n&gt; * **$HMST** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$XLNX** \n&gt; * **$ARNC** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$BX** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$GD** \n&gt; * **$PHM** \n&gt; * **$NVR** \n&gt; * **$PII** \n&gt; * **$SALT** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$NOW** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$NUE** \n&gt; * **$ALK** \n&gt; * **$PLUG** \n&gt; * **$MPC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BhyYBqu.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/LryC0HR.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/UJ0XUOn.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4WIKCya.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZqdHlAC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uNAMC1F.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yyFyqKK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nGue9UL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D7CJT4Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gAvYCNR.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RKvojKG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1aQuGJs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.31.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5YpKIPM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.31.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/r0KJmsx.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Apple, Inc. $318.31\n&gt; **Apple, Inc.

      "selftext": "\nTesla’s stock price has left orbit, not unlike one of founder Elon Musk’s Falcon 9 rockets. But there are those who think it might soon plummet back to earth.\n\nJ.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, in a research note on Friday, urged “extreme caution” regarding the shares of the maker of electric vehicles, which he said could drop 58%.\n\nTesla’s shares (ticker: TSLA) are up about 35% this year and 90% in the past 12 months. Shares closed at $564.82 on Friday, down 1.3%. Brinkman reiterated his Underweight rating.\n\nSuch a bearish tale won’t surprise investors. Tesla is a controversial stock. The average analyst price target, for instance, is well below where the stock trades. Still, investors have been piling in. The surge began last year, when Tesla beat expected third-quarter earnings projections after months of turmoil. Since reaching a 52-week low in June last year, shares have climbed more than 300%. A new plant in Shanghai began production within a year of groundbreaking.\n\nBut Brinkman isn’t buying the hype. “Better deliveries, better earnings, and on-time start of production in China seem the likeliest catalysts, but a closer look suggests less enthusiasm may be warranted,” he writes.\n\nHaving eclipsed Volkswagen (VLKAF) as the world’s second most valuable auto maker, the German giant’s dominance in China should provide an apt benchmark from which to measure success. But market capitalization means little when it comes to sales.\n\nTesla sold 367,500 cars in 2019, just 3.4% of Volkswagen’s total the year prior. Compared to General Motors  ￼(GM) and Ford ￼ (F), Brinkman doesn’t think Tesla has the tools to keep up with its lofty valuation. The company is facing new challenges in 2020. Federal tax credits are dissipating and start-up costs in China will take their toll.\n\nInvestors expect Tesla to ultimately generate more than $9 billion of free cash flow annually, but similar to comparisons to Volkswagen’s size and profitability, it seems premature, given Tesla’s history of negative free cash flow, Brinkman wrote in his report.\n\nSource: Barron's",

      "selftext": "First attempt at thoroughly researching a company. Wish I could I could attatch the spreadsheets I made which more clearly display the financial ratios of Target and its main competitors (Costco &amp; Walmart). I am by no way an expert, and any constructive criticism is valued, especially if there is something I failed to miss or fundamentally don't understand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Strengths**\n\n* Target has a higher **gross margin** (26.32%) than its peers (Costco: 12.98%, Walmart: 25.10%). This means that the company retains more capital on each dollar of sales, which can be used to pay other costs or satisfy debt obligations.\n* Target has an **operating margin** of 5.58%, meaning that each dollar earned in revenue brings 5.58 cents in profit. Because its operating margin is higher than its competitors (Costco: 3.16%, Walmart: 4.50%), the company a has a greater proportion of revenue available to cover non-operating expenses like paying interest.\n* Target has a **net profit margin** of 3.89%, the highest of its main competitors (Costco: 2.40%, Walmart: 1.30%). A net profit margin of 3.89% means that for every dollar generated by Target in sales, the company kept about 4 cents in profit. Retailers tend to have profit margins that are lower than in other sectors, which can run between 0.5% and 3.5%.\n* Target’s **price-to-earnings ratio** of 20.01 is relatively lower than its peers (Costco: 35.53, Walmart: 23.20) which suggests the stock is potentially undervalued among its main competitors.\n* Target has the lowest **price-to-book ratio** (3.26) among its competitors (Costco: 8.50, Walmart: 3.80) which suggests its stock is undervalued. However, this alone shouldn’t be used to assess whether a stock is undervalued. It’s useful to consider the P/B ratio with the company’s ROE, as they both factor in the book value of equity. Because Target has a relatively low P/B ratio and a relatively high **return on equity** (25.47%), the company’s stock is likely undervalued.\n* Target’s **price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio** of (2.48) is lower than its peers (Costco: 4.49, Walmart: 2.48), suggesting its stocks is more undervalued than its competitors.\n* Target’s **price-to-sales ratio** of (0.50) is lower than its peers (Costco: 0.85, Walmart: 0.55) which suggests its stock is more undervalued than its competitors. Furthermore, when complementing the company’s low P/S ratio with its high **net profit margin** (3.89%), the same conclusion can be made.\n* Target’s **price-to-cash-flow ratio** of (6.35) is lower than its competitors (Costco: 20.54, Walmart: 10.17). Although there is no single figure that points to an optimal P/CF ratio, a ratio in the low single digits may indicate the stock is undervalued\n* Target’s relative low **enterprise value to EBITDA** of 11.25 (Costco: 20.06, Walmart: 11.37) indicates that the company may be undervalued\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Good, but Not the Best**\n\n* Target has an **interest coverage ratio** of 9.15, meaning it has around nine times as much in EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) as in debt interest. Although Target is more than able to cover their interest expense with their earnings, the company has the lowest interest coverage ratio among its top competitors (Costco: 32.15, Walmart: 9.67). \n* Target’s **return on assets** (7.30%) is between its competitors (Costco: 8.49%, Walmart: 3.15%). Every dollar that Target has invested in assets generates 7.3 cents of net income, Costco 8.49 cents and Walmart 3.15 cents. This means that Target is better at converting its investments into profits compared with Walmart but not as good as Costco.\n* Target’s **return on equity** of 25.47% is significantly higher than Walmart’s return on equity of 8.87% but slightly less than Costco’s return on equity of 26.10%. A return on equity of 25.47% implies $0.25 returned on every $1 invested. Target’s relatively high return on equity suggests the company efficiently uses its stockholders’ equity to earn profits.\n* Target’s **earnings per share** of 5.56 is between Costco’s (8.32) and Walmart’s (2.28). With a higher earnings per share, we can assume that Target is performing better than Walmart in terms of profitability. This is also reflected in the gross profit margin and net profit margin \n\n  \n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n* Target has the lowest **quick ratio** (0.20) among its peers, with Costco’s and Walmart’s quick ratios being 0.52 and 0.23, respectively. With a quick ratio under one, the company does not have adequate current assets to cover short-term obligations. However, this is not a significant issue, as the retail sector has traditionally had a very low quick ratio. Companies leading the retail sector typically negotiate favorable credit terms with suppliers due to their dominance over the market.\n* Target’s **receivables turnover ratio** of 74.28 is much lower compared to its competitors (Costco: 95.32, Walmart: 86.48), indicating that the company’s collection of accounts receivables is inefficient, and that the company has a high proportion of customers that are either not financially viable or creditworthy. Whereas it takes a around four days for Costco and Walmart to collect its accounts receivables, it takes Target about five days to do so. \n* Target has a significantly lower **inventory turnover ratio** (5.90) than its peers (Costco: 11.80, Walmart: 8.80) which means the company is selling goods at a slower pace and there is less demand for the company’s products. It takes Target approximately 62 days to sell its inventory on hand while it takes Costco about 31 days and Walmart about 41 days.\n* Target’s **asset turnover ratio** of 1.88 is lower than its competitors (Costco: 3.54, Walmart: 2.43), signaling the company is not efficiently using its assets to generate sales. For every dollar in assets, Target generated $1.88 in sales, while Costco and Walmart generated $3.54 and $2.43, respectively. Target’s low turnover may indicate that the company is experiencing sluggish sales or obsolete inventory. Furthermore, its low inventory may also mean the company the company has lax collection methods.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**  In comparison to its peers, Target Corp. struggles to effectively use its assets and manage its liabilities in the short-term. The company’s collection of accounts receivables is inefficient, likely a result of lax collection methods, it sells goods at a slow pace, possibly due to less demand for its products, and the company may be holding obsolete inventory. With regards to liquidity, Target and its top competitors all have a quick ratio of less than one which would indicate that the businesses are not able to meet short-term obligations. However, this is not an issue, as large-cap retailers typically negotiate favorable credit terms with suppliers due to their dominance over the market. The company outshines its competitors in terms of profit-generating abilities. Target retains a great deal of capital on each dollar of sales, it has a large proportion of revenue available to cover non-operating expenses, and it keeps a considerable amount profit for every sale it generates after accounting for all expenses, costs, and cash flow items. Although not up to par with Costco, Target is better able to convert its assets and stockholders’ equity into profits than Walmart. Finally, when examining the company’s market prospect ratios, Target appears to be undervalued when considering its low market value ratios (P/E, P/B, PEG, P/S, EV/EBITDA). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Overall Costco seems to be the best business to invest in with Target being a close second. That said, right now Target looks relatively undervalued in comparison to both companies.",

      "selftext": "# Company Overview\n\n##### Assure Holdings Corp. (“Assure”) was founded in Colorado in 2015 to provide intraoperative neuromonitoring (“IONM”) services for spine, ear, nose, throat, cardiovascular, and other surgeries involving a patient’s central nervous system. IONM has been developed and used over the past 20 years and has become a standard of care in the healthcare industry. \n\nIONM reduces the risk of central nervous system damage after certain types of surgeries. Injuries stemming from surgeries involving a patient’s central nervous system can be difficult to detect immediately following surgery, so IONM allows physicians to detect injuries before they become so severe that no viable action can be taken. Common risks of surgeries involving the central nervous system include paralysis, muscle weakness, and hearing loss.\n\n# Management Team\n\nIn 2018, Assure’s founder and CEO, Preston Parsons, transitioned to a director on the company’s board, focused on key growth initiatives such as surgical/geographical expansion and strategic acquisitions. Simultaneously, John Farlinger became the company’s CEO. Mr. Farlinger has \\~20 years of experience as a venture capital and private equity executive. It’s worth mentioning that both Mr. Parsons and Mr. Farlinger received total compensation around $350,000 in 2018 with Mr. Parsons owning \\~39% of the company (equivalent to a $16 million stake at today’s stock price of $1.22). As a result, I believe the company’s management team is well incentivized to maximize shareholder value over the long-term. \n\n# Financials\n\nYear-to-date 2019, the company grew revenue 112% to $22.4 million, as well as increasing net income and adjusted EBITDA to $9.3 million and $13.8 million, representing increases of 143% and 154%, respectively. In addition, Assure grew its managed case volume by 95% in Q3 2019. In the first half of 2019, the company completed a $0.7 million tuck-in acquisitions that added a couple hundred cases to Assure’s market share. The company recently announced a $7.0 million acquisition for a company that is slated to close in early 2020. This acquisition has completed 2,500 cases in the last 12 months, 95% of which were derived from commercial insurance payors (compared to \\~50% for Assure). I would expect Assure to continue to pursue more acquisitions as the company continues to scale and is able to gain access to more growth capital to further consolidate the IONM industry. \n\n# Key Risks\n\nIt’s worth noting that this company is fairly small, with a market cap of approximately $50 million. This means the company historically had a fairly concentrated portion of revenue generated from a single state/surgical procedure, in addition to various other operational/execution risks. For instance, the company suffered from some revenue cycle management and cash collection issues in 2018, which resulted in a large bad debt expense for the year. The company recently hired a VP of strategy and a revenue cycle management director in order to better control cash collections and avoid a similar bad debt expense charge the company recorded in 2018. Out-of-network revenue and cash collections remain key issues to monitor going forward.\n\n# Summary\n\nGiven the company’s progress in 2019, I estimate that Assure will generate revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA of $30 million, $12 million, and $18 million, respectively. This equates to net and EBITDA margins of 40% and 60%, respectively. Practically every financial metric has grown 90%+ in 2019 (compared to pro-forma 2018 figures reflecting the company’s bad debt expense), so I think it is reasonable to conclude that the company is able to grow its top and bottom-line by 30% in 2020. This would result in revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA of $39 million, $15.6 million, and $23.4 million, respectively.\n\nBased off my 2020 projections, the company has a forward price/sales ratio of 1.3x, a P/E ratio of 3x, and an EV/EBITDA ratio of 2x. With 2020 EPS of $0.39 and a P/E ratio of 15 (given a 30% growth profile), the company should be trading at a price of \\~$6.00 per share (\\~4-5x the current stock price of $1.35). Assuming 25% top and bottom line growth in 2021 and 20% top and bottom line growth in 2022, the company should generate EPS of $0.59. At a P/E ratio of 15, the company is likely to trade at $8.85 per share. Given the growth profile of Assure, I would expect the market to attribute a P/E ratio closer to its bottom line growth profile (a company growing earnings by 20% should trade a at a P/E of 20, all else being equal). Of course, the general level of interest rates and other macroeconomic factors impact the multiples certain companies trade at; however, I believe as Assure scales, the company will attract more institutional capital and will trade closer to a P/E ratio around 20x in 2022. Assuming EPS of $0.59, the company should trade at a price of $11.80 (\\~10x the company’s current share price). \n\nI have a long position in ARHH.

U.S. stock futures are sliding early Monday following Wall Street’s worst day of 2020 on Friday. The Dow already has a four-day losing streak in place, its longest since August, and is coming off its largest weekly loss in five months. The S&amp;P 500′s weekly decline last week was its largest in nearly four months. (CNBC)\n* Treasury yields move lower as coronavirus fears escalate (CNBC)\n* Gold climbs to 2-week high as virus fears spark safety buying (Reuters)\n* International oil prices drop below $60 as China virus drives demand concern (Reuters)\n* More than 2,800 people in China are now infected by the fast-spreading Wuhan coronavirus while more countries have reported their first confirmed cases. Chinese officials have said there are 2,862 confirmed cases, with the death toll rising to 81. On Sunday, the United States on Sunday reported its fifth confirmed case in Arizona. (CNBC)\n* Travel-related stocks are likely to be hit once again as coronavirus cases mount, including major airlines like United (UAL), Delta (DAL), American (AAL) and Southwest (LUV), and cruise line operators like Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald’s have temporarily closed near the Chinese city of Wuhan.\n* On today’s U.S. economic calendar, the government will release its December report on new home sales at 10 a.m. ET. Arconic (ARNC), DR Horton (DH) and Sprint (S) are among the companies issuing quarterly earnings this morning, while Whirlpool (WHR), Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Rambus (RMBS) report after the bell.\n* Federal safety investigators launched a probe into a helicopter crash in the LA area that killed basketball legend Kobe Bryant and eight others, including his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna. The cause of the crash has not yet been determined. NBA athletes, officials and fans mourned Bryant’s death in messages and memorials across social media. (CNBC)\n* ‘Terrible,’ ‘heartbreaking,’ ‘devastated’ — World leaders and athletes mourn the death of Kobe Bryant (CNBC)\n* Athletes pay tribute to Kobe Bryant. ‘He was like a little brother to me’ Michael Jordan says (CNBC)\n* A passenger plane crashed in central Afghanistan, senior Afghan officials said today. According to local media, the plane went down in territory under Taliban control. It was initially reported to be a jet from state-owned Ariana Afghan Airlines. However, the airline’s acting CEO has denied that one of their planes has crashed. (CNBC)\n* President Donald Trump is expected to disclose details of his long-delayed Mideast peace proposal to Israeli leaders today. Trump will hold separate, back-to-back meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White Party. Gantz is Netanyahu’s rival in March 2 elections. (Reuters)\n* Trump’s impeachment trial enters a pivotal week as his defense team resumes its case and senators face a critical vote on whether to hear witnesses or proceed directly to a vote that is widely expected to end in his acquittal. The articles of impeachment charge Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. (AP)\n* Democrats stepped up their calls for former national security advisor John Bolton to testify at the trial after an explosive report alleged that in his unpublished book, he said Trump personally tied Ukraine aid to an investigation of the Bidens, an account that conflicts with the president’s. (NBC News)\n* Trump denies telling Bolton Ukraine aid was tied to investigations (The Hill)\n* Sen. Bernie Sanders holds an edge in the 2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary as the key presidential nominating contest nears, according to an NBC News/Marist poll. The Vermont senator garners the support of 22% of likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State, the survey found. Ex-Mayor Pete Buttigieg trails at 17%. (CNBC)\n* Sen.

On Monday, SVB Leerink analyst Ami Fadia published her answer, and it wasn’t rosy.\n\nFadia downgraded Mylan (ticker: MYL) to Market Perform from Outperform, writing that she sees earnings for the combined companies dropping for the next two years.\n\n“We do not see the combined business starting to grow until 2023, which we believe is not fully understood,” Fadia wrote. “This is because we see the business deteriorating faster than realization of cost synergies and we do not see revenue synergies anytime soon.”\n\nFadia set a price target of $24, down from her previous price target of $27. The stock closed on Friday at $21.85.\n\nShares of Mylan were tumbling Monday morning, down 3.3% to $21.13 in early trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.4%. Mylan didn’t immediately respond to request for comment on the downgrade.\n\nThe back story. Mylan is set to merge with Pfizer’s (PFE) generic-drug unit, called Upjohn, later this year to become a new generic-drug company called Viatris. The merger marks a major turning point for Pfizer, but also for Mylan. In early January, Piper Sandler analyst David Amsellempublished a cautionary note on the merger, giving Mylan a Neutral rating. Mylan was up 8.7% this year as of Friday’s close, but down 24.8% over the past 12 months.\n\nWhat’s new. In her Monday note, Fadia warned that the Upjohn part of the business faces serious challenges, attributable in large part to changes in how the Chinese government buys drugs.\n\n“We believe the potential impact from China’s [volume based procurement] program for Lipitor and Norvasc is underestimated by both Pfizer and the Street, with potentially a $1.3 [billion] revenue headwind in 2020, or $200-600 [million] more than Pfizer’s guidance,” Fadia wrote.\n\nShe also wrote that Mylan’s own earnings would see only slow growth in the coming years. “We see the Mylan standalone business growing low single digits at best through 2023 with all key major products declining and no clear sustainable growth drivers in the pipeline,” Fadia wrote.\n\nStill, she said that there is hope for the stock. “We acknowledge that this merger could become accretive to Mylan’s shareholders if Viatris can pull off revenue synergies faster and/or realize more cost synergies, but the potential scope and timeline of such synergies so far remains unclear,” she wrote.\n\nLooking forward. Fadia argued that the current price of Mylan factors into the merger. “We forecast revenue decline of 13% in 2020 and 3% in 2021 for Viatris, followed by a relatively flat top-line in 2022-2023.”\n\nPfizer reports earnings Tuesday morning and investors could learn more about the merger on a conference call scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Eastern time.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/mylan-stock-upjohn-pfizer-merger-earnings-2023-synergies-51580138201",

Trump is impeached or B. He is not impeached? I'd imagine not much would change if he wasn't, but I could foresee a slight to moderate drop if he was.

So far I have not had a day of loss since I started trading again, which hasn't been too long.  I don't really want to trade with money that I cannot afford to lose, so even trading with a margin loan just makes it so that I'm borrowing money where my collateral is *my* money.  So if the value of a stock goes against me by 50%, I lose 100% of my investment and my shares get closed out (long/short).  Not to mention margin calls and margin maintenance.  However, if I take out a personal loan with a monthly repayment of around $100-$150, then I am trading with more than I can currently trade with, and I'm not risking losing money that I cannot afford to lose.  And I wouldn't have to worry about losing twice the money in half the movement.  So then this loan would be exclusively for trading with.  Worst case scenario I'm paying $100/month and have learned a valuable lesson which is fine with my current financial situation.  I'm only going to be going long and short on companies that fit my trading strategies.\n\nFor all intents and purposes taking out a personal loan feels wiser in my current situation than taking out a margin loan, as I otherwise would not have what feels like a safer way of coming up with a significant enough amount of money to have consistent small percentage gains generate passable supplemental income; though I would likely put the profits back into the investment account and pay the monthly repayment cost out of pocket.\n\nThe people in my life that I have shared this with see where I am coming from, though initially being against it, are now starting to agree with me, given certain life circumstances that restrict me from generating much investment capital otherwise.\n\nIn any posts however people have been against it for the most part, so I wanted to explain my reasoning and see what anyone here thought of it.

      "selftext": " \n\nJan 27, 2020 (TheNewswire.ca via COMTEX) -- (via TheNewswire)\n\nVancouver, Canada - TheNewswire - January 27, 2020 - Guyana Goldstrike Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"Guyana Goldstrike\") (GYA) [**GYNAF,** **+37.43%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gynaf?mod=MW_story_quote) (1ZT) is pleased to announce the Company has signed a definitive gold forward purchase agreement (the \"Agreement\"), dated January 24, 2020, with an arms-length investor (the \"Investor\") for proceeds of up to US$9,000,000, for the Marudi Gold Project (\"Marudi\" or the \"Property\", or the \"Project\") located in Guyana, South America.\n\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, the Investor will make an initial payment of US$2,000,000 on or before April 14, 2020. Thereafter, a second payment of US$7,000,000 will be advanced within thirty days of a royalty interest in the Project in favour of the Investor having been registered.\n\nThe Agreement is non-dilutive to the Company's current share structure as no shares or warrants will be issued to the Investor. The proceeds will enable the Company to finalize its purchase of the Project and further explore and develop the resource potential of the Property.\n\nIn consideration for providing funding, the Company has agreed to deliver 30,000 ounces of gold, representing approximately 10% of the Project's current mineral resource estimate (please see \"Mineral Resource Estimates\" below). Deliveries will commence within 120 days of a declaration of commercial production from the Project, or within 36 months of the initial funding under the Agreement, whichever the earlier, with an annual delivery schedule of 3,000 ounces. The Company has also agreed to grant the Investor a right of first refusal to acquire a further 30,000 ounces of gold, on terms to be negotiated between the parties.\n\nThe delivery obligation of the Company will be secured by a 12.5% net smelter returns royalty in favour of the Investor, to be registered against the Project. The royalty will not be payable while the Company meets the deliver schedule and will expire once all delivery obligations under the Agreement have been satisfied.\n\nMineral Resource Estimates\n\nThe Mazoa Hill Zone contains the Company's current mineral resource estimate. Data analyzed suggests that the mineralized zone is open in several directions including at depth.\n\n\\- 243,300 indicated gold ounces within 3,637,000 tonnes grading 2.1 g/t;\n\n\\- 78,800 inferred gold ounces within 1,278,000 tonnes grading 1.9 g/t\n\nFor further information concerning the Mazoa Hill Zone Resource Estimate, readers are encouraged to review \"Technical Report: Marudi Property Mazoa Hill Mineral Resource Estimate\", a technical report prepared for the Company by Global Mineral Resource Services and is available at: GYA Mazoa Hill Zone 43-101, at the Company's website [**www.guyanagoldstrike.com**](http://www.guyanagoldstrike.com/) and under the Company's profile on [**www.sedar.com**](http://www.sedar.com/).\n\nReaders are cautioned that although the Project has a mineral resource estimate and a mining license a production decision has not been reached by the Company in respect of the Project, nor has a feasibility study been completed to assess the economic viability of commercial production at the Project. Also note, mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n\nAbout Guyana Goldstrike Inc.\n\nThe Company is developing the Marudi Gold Project, which has a 17-year mining license and is located in Guyana, South America. Historic diamond drilling completed on the Project by prior operators have delineated two zones of gold mineralization: Mazoa Hill and Marudi North zones. A mineral resource estimate has been completed on the Mazoa Hill Zone. Data analyzed suggests the zone is open to mineralization in multiple directions and at depth.\n\nThrough the recent exploration program, the Company has discovered a third mineralized zone, called Toucan Ridge, which is situated approximately 1000 metres to the northeast of the Mazoa Hill Zone. In addition to the known gold zones and the new Toucan Ridge zone, the Company has over 45 sq. kms of underexplored land and believes the greater land position has excellent upside potential for the discovery of new mineralized zones through the development of previously and newly identified mineralized bedrock targets on the Project.\n\nAbout Guyana\n\nThe Republic of Guyana is located in South America adjacent to Suriname. The country is English speaking and its legal system is based on British common law with a democratically elected government. It has an established mining act and a rich history of gold production. The Fraser Institute's 2016 Annual Survey of Mining listed Guyana as the third best mining jurisdiction with regards to investment attractiveness in the Latin America and Caribbean Basin sub-group. The Guiana Shield is the geographic gold-hosting region and is world-recognized as a premier gold region that is highly prospective, under-explored and has geological continuity with West Africa. Barrick has recently announced that the Giuana Shield will be their priority region for discovery opportunities and early stage exploration.\\* Exxon Recently announced the discovery of 6 billion barrels of offshore oil with production scheduled for first quarter of 2020. This discovery will designate Guyana as having the fastest growing GPD in 2020, estimated to be 86%.\\*\\*\n\n\\*[**https://www.reuters.com/article/us-barrick-gold-randgold-rsrcs-explorati/barrick-keen-on-guyana-shield-canada-for-exploration-executive-idUSKCN1NL276**](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-barrick-gold-randgold-rsrcs-explorati/barrick-keen-on-guyana-shield-canada-for-exploration-executive-idUSKCN1NL276)\n\n\\*\\*[**https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-02/meet-the-economy-that-the-imf-sees-growing-86-in-2020**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-02/meet-the-economy-that-the-imf-sees-growing-86-in-2020)\n\nQualified Person\n\nLocke Goldsmith, M.Sc., P.

The results support the potential for CRV431 to exert potent antifibrotic activity in NASH.\n\n\"CRV431 offers a novel approach to the treatment of fibrosis caused by NASH and possibly other causes of liver injury,\" stated Dr. Robert Foster, CEO of Hepion Pharmaceuticals. \"This is because CRV431 acts, in part, by directly targeting fibrotic scar formation by down-regulating an important regulator of collagen synthesis, cyclophilin B, thereby reducing collagen production. This contrasts with most other NASH drug candidates that target events such as dyslipidemia or diabetes that may lead to fibrosis. Combining the direct antifibrotic actions of CRV431 with the indirect actions of other drug candidates likely represents the best opportunity for rapidly and effectively decreasing liver fibrosis in NASH.\"\n\n[http://irdirect.net/prviewer/release/id/4213759](http://irdirect.net/prviewer/release/id/4213759) \n\nGlobal Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) market is expected to cross US$ 20.0 Billion by 2025 growing at a CAGR of more than 10.0% during given forecast period from 2018-2025.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/nonalcoholic-steatohepatitis-nash-market-size-2019-share-demand-growth-and-forecast-by-2024-2019-10-17](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/nonalcoholic-steatohepatitis-nash-market-size-2019-share-demand-growth-and-forecast-by-2024-2019-10-17)\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.

Thereafter, a second payment of $7-million (U.S.) will be advanced within 30 days of a royalty interest in the project in favour of the investor having been registered.\n\nThe agreement is non-dilutive to the company's current share structure as no shares or warrants will be issued to the investor. The proceeds will enable the company to finalize its purchase of the project and further explore and develop the resource potential of the property.\n\nIn consideration for providing financing, the company has agreed to deliver 30,000 ounces of gold, representing approximately 10 per cent of the project's current mineral resource estimate (please see mineral resource estimates section herein). Deliveries will commence within 120 days of a declaration of commercial production from the project, or within 36 months of the initial financing under the agreement, whichever is the earlier, with an annual delivery schedule of 3,000 ounces. The company has also agreed to grant the investor a right of first refusal to acquire a further 30,000 ounces of gold, on terms to be negotiated between the parties.\n\nThe delivery obligation of the company will be secured by a 12.5-per-cent net smelter return royalty in favour of the investor, to be registered against the project. The royalty will not be payable while the company meets the delivery schedule and will expire once all delivery obligations under the agreement have been satisfied.\n\nMineral resource estimates\n\nThe Mazoa Hill zone contains the company's current mineral resource estimate. Data analyzed suggest that the mineralized zone is open in several directions, including at depth:\n\n* 243,300 indicated gold ounces within 3,637,000 tonnes grading 2.1 grams per tonne;\n* 78,800 inferred gold ounces within 1,278,000 tonnes grading 1.9 grams per tonne.\n\nFor further information concerning the Mazoa Hill zone resource estimate, readers are encouraged to review \"Technical Report: Marudi Property, Mazoa Hill Mineral Resource Estimate,\" a technical report prepared for the company by Global Mineral Resource Services and available at the company's website and under the company's profile on SEDAR.\n\nReaders are cautioned that although the project has a mineral resource estimate and a mining licence, a production decision has not been reached by the company in respect of the project, nor has a feasibility study been completed to assess the economic viability of commercial production at the project. Also note that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n\nAbout Guyana Goldstrike Inc.\n\nThe company is developing the Marudi gold project, which has a 17-year mining licence and is located in Guyana, South America. Historical diamond drilling completed on the project by prior operators have delineated two zones of gold mineralization: the Mazoa Hill and Marudi North zones.\n\nThrough the recent exploration program, the company has discovered a third mineralized zone, called Toucan Ridge, which is situated approximately 1,000 metres to the northeast of the Mazoa Hill zone. In addition to the known gold zones and the new Toucan Ridge zone, the company has over 45 square kilometres of underexplored land and believes the greater land position has excellent upside potential for the discovery of new mineralized zones through the development of previously and newly identified mineralized bedrock targets on the project.\n\nQualified person\n\nLocke Goldsmith, MSc, PEng, PGeo, chief geologist and exploration manager of the company, is a qualified person in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 -- Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. Mr. Goldsmith has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical content of this news release.",

      "selftext": "During Pfizer’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, its executives made an easy-to-miss revelation about their plan to spin off the company’s Upjohn division and merge it with Mylan to form the new company Viatris.\n\nA few analysts picked up on Pfizer’s new strategy for the spinoff—but they’re not sure the outlook for the redesigned Upjohn is so rosy.\n\nPfizer said it now plans to sell two assets to the Mylan-Upjohn spinoff, which will be named Viatris. They are Meridian, the manufacturer of EpiPen and other auto-injectable products, and Mylan-Japan, which is the generics collaboration Pfizer formed with Mylan in 2012. Revenues from both units totaled $598 million last year and were flat from the previous year, Pfizer said (PDF).\n\nAs a result, Pfizer upped its 2020 revenue guidance for Upjohn to $8 billion to $8.5 billion, from $7.5 billion to $8 billion. But the company isn't expecting much of a bottom-line boost for the bulked-up unit: It nudged up the high end of its forecast for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion, but kept the low end at $3.8 billion. The company is expecting to close the Viatris spinoff in mid-2020.\n\n\nBut even the low end of 2020 expectations for Upjohn could be hard to achieve, some analysts fear. It’s “a high bar,” warned SVB Leerink analyst Ami Fadia in a note to clients after Pfizer’s earnings announcement Tuesday.\n\nWhy? One problem is that during the fourth quarter three major Upjohn products missed SVB Leerink’s expectations: Lyrica in the U.S., and Norvasc and Lipitor in emerging markets. That “reinforces our thesis that there could be more downside to these products in 2020 and beyond,” Fadia wrote.\n\nLyrica, in particular, is struggling against generic competitors. It’s been a challenge ever since the product lost its patent protection last summer and its share of U.S. prescriptions plummeted to 43% within weeks as a wave of generic rivals hit the market.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, U.S. sales of Lyrica came in at $88 million, a whopping 91% fall over the same period a year ago and 34% below SVB Leerink’s expectations.\n\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat also has low expectations for Upjohn in the short term, but much of his concern centers on China. The country has been rolling out a volume-based procurement (VBP) program designed to save money on off-patent drugs. Revenues from Lipitor and Norvasc took a hit in the provinces where the program was pilot-tested, and Pfizer executives told Raffat they expect a broad rollout to all Chinese provinces in 2020.\n\nThe sales declines on Lipitor and Norvasc in China seemed to be slowing down in the last half of 2020, Raffat noted. But with VBP set to expand, “that implies more [sales] erosion yet to come in 2020,” he warned in a note to investors.\n\nAssuming Pfizer consummates the plan to fold Meridian and Mylan-Japan into Viatris, that in and of itself will place another challenge on the spinoff’s shoulders. Meridian has been suffering from manufacturing issues, resulting in an EpiPen supply shortfall that has opened the door for competitors. Novartis’ Sandoz unit, for one, took advantage of the situation last July, launching an aggressive rollout of its EpiPen rival Symjepi.\n\n“It remains unclear whether the supply issue of EpiPen could get remedied once [Viatris] has the full control of Meridian,” Fadia said.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/pfizer-bulking-up-its-mylan-upjohn-spinoff-but-investors-may-not-reap-rewards-analysts",

      "selftext": " \n\nJanuary 30, 2020 - TheNewswire - Vancouver, Canada - Guyana Goldstrike Inc. (the \" Company \" or \" Guyana Goldstrike \") (TSXV: GYA ) , ( OTC:GYNAF ) , ( FSE:1ZT ) is pleased to announce that the Company has selected drill targets at the Marudi Gold Project (\" Marudi \" or the \"Property\" , or the \" Project \") located in Guyana, South America.\n\nThe Company's 2018/19 trenching program successfully outlined a new mineralized area that continues for more than 1.75 kilometres along Toucan Ridge (see map below). Toucan Ridge is roughly one kilometre northeast of the Mazoa Hill Zone which currently contains the Project's mineral resource estimate (please see \" Mineral Resource Estimate \" below).\n\nA diamond drill program of up to 12 holes is planned and may be extended. The planned drill program will predominately focus on Toucan Ridge where a total of 2,458 metres of trenching was completed and 837 samples were taken.\n\nDrill targets have been chosen from identified magnetic anomalies and gold assays from surface trenching and sampling of the quartzite-metachert host rock.\n\nThe specific drill locations will be in proximity to trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8, as priority targets, followed potentially by drilling trench areas TTR-18-9, TTR-18-11, TTR-18-12, and TTR-18-13.\n\nIn 2018, trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8 assayed grades as high as 7.2 g/t Au over 3 metres.\n\nThe first drill pads will be positioned to drill angled holes across the area of trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8 to an initial planned depth of 130 metres and a maximum depth of 200 metres.\n\nIn preparation for the next phase of exploration, the technical team has reviewed the legacy data, including drill assays, drill angles, collar location, grade and interval lengths from past drilling on the Property in order to further refine its exploration efforts at Marudi. The compilation of these historic drill assays will provide important information that the technical team will use to calibrate drilling on the Property.\n\nThe following assay highlights are from the Mazoa Hill Zone which is approximately one kilometre south west of the Toucan Ridge discovery area:\n\nAssay Highlights of Sutton Resources Diamond Drill Programs 1991-94 - Mazoa Hill Zone:\n\n* \\- MR 91-068 - 6 metres of 29.97 g/t Au; within 72 metres of 5.11 g/t Au  \n\\- MR 91-074 - 15 metres of 15.30 g/t Au; within 75.00 metres of 4.60 g/t Au  \n\\- MR 94-102 - 52 metres of 4.06 g/t Au; within 190 metres of 2.39 g/t Au  \n\\- MR 94-113 - 36 metres of 7.74 g/t Au; within 141 metres of 3.31 g/t Au  \n\\- MR 94-115 - 45 metres of 10.82 g/t Au and 30 metres of 15.16 g/t Au; within 81 metres of 7.71 g/t Au  \n\\- MR 94-120 - 12 metres of 16.65 g/t Au; within 57 metres of 4.51 g/t Au\n\nPlease note: Interval lengths are not true widths.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMineral Resource Estimates\n\nThe Mazoa Hill Zone contains the Company's current mineral resource estimate. Data analyzed suggests that the mineralized zone is open in several directions including at depth.\n\n* \\- 243,300 indicated gold ounces within 3,637,000 tonnes grading 2.1 g/t;  \n\\- 78,800 inferred gold ounces within 1,278,000 tonnes grading 1.9 g/t\n\nFor further information concerning the Mazoa Hill Zone Resource Estimate, readers are encouraged to review \" Technical Report: Marudi Property Mazoa Hill Mineral Resource Estimate \", a technical report prepared for the Company by Global Mineral Resource Services and is available at: [GYA Mazoa Hill Zone 43-101 ](http://www.guyanagoldstrike.com/images/pdf/43101_Report_Guyana_Goldstrike_Mazoa_Hill_Zone_Jan_2018.pdf), at the Company's website [www.guyanagoldstrike.com ](http://www.guyanagoldstrike.com/)and under the Company's profile on [www.sedar.com ](http://www.sedar.com/).\n\nReaders are cautioned that although the Project has a mineral resource estimate and a mining license a production decision has not been reached by the Company in respect of the Project, nor has a feasibility study been completed to assess the economic viability of commercial production at the Project. Also note, mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n\nThe Company also announces that Frontier Flex Marketing (Frontier) continues to provide investor relations and marketing services to the Company. The agreement with Frontier commenced on January 2019, with remuneration of $7,000 per month. The services were put on hiatus for an extended period in 2019. The Company has re-commenced services as of January 2020. This was part of an extension and revision to an original agreement with Frontier Merchant Capital for similar investor relations and marketing services that was signed on January 2018, with remuneration of $5,000 per month. Frontier Merchant Capital were also granted 50,000 stock options of the Company at 25 cents in January 2018 and 150,000 stock options at 30 cents on October 30, 2018.\n\nAbout Guyana Goldstrike Inc.\n\nThe Company is developing the Marudi Gold Project, which has a 17-year mining license and is located in Guyana, South America. Historic diamond drilling completed on the Project by prior operators have delineated two zones of gold mineralization: Mazoa Hill and Marudi North zones. A mineral resource estimate has been completed on the Mazoa Hill Zone. Data analyzed suggests the zone is open to mineralization in multiple directions and at depth.\n\nThrough the recent exploration program, the Company has discovered a third mineralized zone, called Toucan Ridge, which is situated approximately 1000 metres to the northeast of the Mazoa Hill Zone. In addition to the known gold zones and the new Toucan Ridge zone, the Company has over 45 sq. kms of underexplored land and believes the greater land position has excellent upside potential for the discovery of new mineralized zones through the development of previously and newly identified mineralized bedrock targets on the Project.\n\nAbout Guyana\n\nThe Republic of Guyana is located in South America adjacent to Suriname. The country is English speaking and its legal system is based on British common law with a democratically elected government. It has an established mining act and a rich history of gold production. The Fraser Institute's 2016 Annual Survey of Mining listed Guyana as the third best mining jurisdiction with regards to investment attractiveness in the Latin America and Caribbean Basin sub-group. The Guiana Shield is the geographic gold-hosting region and is world-recognized as a premier gold region that is highly prospective, under-explored and has geological continuity with West Africa. Barrick has recently announced that the Giuana Shield will be their priority region for discovery opportunities and early stage exploration.\\* Exxon Recently announced the discovery of 6 billion barrels of offshore oil with production scheduled for first quarter of 2020. This discovery will designate Guyana as having the fastest growing GPD in 2020, estimated to be 86%.\\*\\*\n\n\\*https://www.reuters.com/article/us-barrick-gold-randgold-rsrcs-explorati/barrick-keen-on-guyana-shield-canada-for-exploration-executive-idUSKCN1NL276\n\n\\*\\*https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-02/meet-the-economy-that-the-imf-sees-growing-86-in-2020\n\nQualified Person\n\nLocke Goldsmith, M.Sc., P.

Thursday was a prime example, with the Dow falling as many as 244 points and then rallying along with the other major averages to finish higher. The Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq remain poised to post their fifth straight month of gains, although they could also post a second straight weekly loss for the first time in four months. (CNBC)\n* US Treasury yields rise after briefly sending a recession signal (CNBC)\n* The World Health Organization said the fast-spreading coronavirus that’s now infected more than 9,800 people across the world is a global health emergency, a rare designation that helps the international agency mobilize financial and political support to contain the outbreak. Shortly before, the U.S. confirmed the nation’s first person-to-person transmission of the virus. (CNBC)\n* Facebook to remove coronavirus misinformation after WHO declares global emergency (Reuters)\n* State Department issues ‘do not travel’ advisory for China, asks those in the country to consider leaving (CNBC)\n* Two patients from the same family in England have tested positive for the coronavirus. England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said today his team was “working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had,” in order to prevent further spread. (CNBC)\n* The week ends with a busy morning of U.S. economic data, beginning with December personal income and spending at 8:30 a.m. ET. The Chicago purchasing managers index is out at 9:45 a.m. ET, and the University of Michigan’s final January consumer sentiment index is out at 10 a.m. ET. Dow components Caterpillar (CAT), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) highlight this morning’s quarterly earnings report. No reports are scheduled for after the bell. (CNBC)\n* Caterpillar earnings top expectations, but CEO warns about ‘global economic uncertainty’ (CNBC)\n* Shares of Amazon (AMZN) climbed nearly 9% in premarket trading after smashing earnings expectations for the fourth quarter. The company’s market cap surged above $1 trillion. Amazon first hit a $1 trillion market cap in September 2018 but went below that level after the stock market at the time tanked. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are all currently above the trillion-dollar threshold. (CNBC)\n* Jeff Bezos’ net worth jumps by over $12 billion after Amazon’s big quarter (CNBC)\n* IBM shares jumped as much as 5% in the premarket after the company said Arvind Krishna will become its 10th CEO, replacing Ginni Rometty, effective April 6. During Rometty’s tenure as CEO, which began in 2012, shares of IBM fell about 26%, compared to the S&amp;P 500′s advance of 160%. (CNBC)\n* Retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander said he’ll vote against any proposals for further witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, dealing a blow to Democrats. if the GOP-majority chamber votes, likely today, not to allow that new content, then the trial could quickly proceed to a final vote on whether to acquit Trump or remove him from office. (CNBC)\n* House of Representatives passes two measures limiting Trump’s ability to go to war with Iran (CNBC)\n* Sen. Bernie Sanders has jumped into a virtual tie with former Vice President Joe Biden nationally just before the first nominating contests in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released today. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is in third, while former Mayor Mike Bloomberg leaped ahead of Mayor Pete Buttigieg for fourth. (CNBC)\n* Sanders backed by 200,000-member postal workers union in 2020 primary (CNBC)\n* After more than three years of tough negotiations between British and European officials, its departure from the EU is finally taking place today at 6 p.m. ET. The departure will mark the start of a “transition period” in which the U.K. remains a member of the single market and customs union, but begins negotiations with the EU in the hope of striking a free trade deal. (CNBC)\n* One Medical parent 1Life Healthcare (ONEM) priced its initial public offering at $14 per share, at the bottom of the expected range of $14-$16 per share. The health care services firm, which is not yet profitable, raised $245 million in gross proceeds through JPMorgan (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS).\n* Here’s a look at the road to Sunday’s Super Bowl by the numbers: After more than 4,000 plays, 1,000 points and 125 touchdowns between them, the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs made it to the big game. The Chiefs have relied on a big-play passing game led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, while the Niners have had plenty of success on the defensive side.

There's a ton of doubt about this merger, but I for one can't fathom it not going through. It would make no logical sense for a judge to deny a merger under the grounds that it would create less competition (which is what the states are suing over) for the following reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If the deal falls through, Sprint wouldn't survive independently anyway\n   * It could potentially be bought out by a number of other companies in this case\n* In exchange for the deal, Sprint has a deal to sell off Boost mobile to Dish networks which would maintain a cheaper cellular service alternative\n* T-Mobile has made an agreement not to raise any prices on any of their plans for a number of years after the deal\n* This plan would allow T-Mobile to make custom deals with varying degrees of connection once they combine Sprint's bandwidth with their own\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf and when this merger is accepted in the following weeks, the price is bound to rise past $7.83 which is the value that the merger offer places Sprint stock at. The last time it was believed the merger was going through, $S jumped to over $8.50. It currently sits at $4.37 as I type this. \n\nThe new T-Mobile will immediately become a powerhouse player and start eating away at Verizon and AT&amp;T's market share. It will position them to have the best 5G in existence due to Sprint's investments in the technology over the years. \n\nAnother motive for this merger is to beat Huawei at 5G coverage in the states. It would be a serious injustice for us to stop this kind of technological race from completing over a bunch of district attorneys trying to act virtuous for political points. \n\nIt's unlikely that a failure to merge would really destroy Sprint as a whole. They've just set up a round of a billion dollars in funding to helpcover their debts. I can't imagine $S falling below $3.40 if this fails.\n\nLet's say there's a 40% chance of this merger going through. In poker, if you have a 40% chance of winning a hand with a promise of 200% return on your investment, and the risk is only a 25% loss if you're wrong, you gamble.

The past few days of watching YANG, it has become evident that it goes up when S&amp;P 500 is down and goes down when S&amp;P 500 is up, regardless of how poorly the FTSE 50 China performed. FTSE 50 China tanked multiple days in a row, but YANG only really went up when S&amp;P 500 went down too. I noticed this several times.\n\n2. Due to this, I'm uncertain how the price of an ETF like YANG is actually calculated. Theoretically, Monday morning when Chinese stocks almost certainly tank in Shanghai, I'd think YANG would be up quite a bit. However, due to the pattern I noticed in relation to S&amp;P 500, it worries me that US markets will open green and therefore YANG would barely go up at all, if any. As an example, YANG was actually down 3% despite the FTSE 50 China being down 3% that day.\n\nSo, I'm curious how an ETF's price/value is determined. I want to hop back in on YANG but I'm trying to bet against China's market, not ours.",

As soon as the company became large enough to be in the news cycle, these people started seeing jobs and Star and Stripes cars and car components as well as a car manufacturer which didn't require a (huge) bailout .\n\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum you have Google, Facebook (also Amazon) which are hated in a bipartisan way. Leftists think they are monopolies and should be broken up, Right wingers think they are biased and censoring them because they are politically left-leaning (again Cali) so they should be broken up.\n\nSo my questions are :\n\n1) If Facebook or Google were to get a masters of the narratives and cohercion similar to Elon Musk on board as the CEO (in the case of Google) or as an aide to the CEO (in the case of Facebook) how much market cap would they gain?\n\n2) Alternatively if Tesla were to lose its masters of narratives and cohercion how much would the company be worth?\n\n3) Would this matter? Is it Musk which is good selling narratives or is it a matter of business model? AKA Tesla's business model is popular whereas Google's and Facebook isn't\n\nThis is a way to try and calculate how much market cap is worth having a bipartisan support.\n\nI think it's worth something but I had discussion in the past with people who know about this stuff and they said it's not worth a lot because the scenario is binary so as long as the government isn't actively trying to break a company apart this is not worth anything. This was partially confirmed by the Zuckerberg hearing in front of Congress which ended up being a loud show which didn't produce any real change",
