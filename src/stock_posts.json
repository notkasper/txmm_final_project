[Hyl11on’s] main goal is to supply hybrid and electric propulsion systems that can be slotted into various manufacturers’ existing heavy-truck models and thereby lower their emissions and the total cost of ownership.\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt; The retail investor frenzy that propelled Tesla Inc. to a $380 billion valuation this year — and valued Nikola at $29 billion — has boosted [...] [Hyl11on] too.

      "selftext": "So I had an idea for starting a serious community for students/early graduates interested in investing and developing a better investor acumen. Ultimately, this community would be for students who are serious about learning about investing from other students, professionals early in their finance career, and lessons from notable investors like Buffett, Lynch, Munger, and others.\n\nWhy a community? Well in my experience I owe a lot of what I've learned from talking with students and mentors who are 2-3 years more experienced than me but talking with them has helped me narrow the gap between professionals with years of experience and myself, a student with relatively little experience. This community could help bridge the gap between students and real-world experience. This community is for students that are interested in investing but want a good starting point, with a good community of people to challenge one another to learn, and help with mock interviews or who knows what else.\n\nThis community could also be good for students who want to learn more about different investing styles. Could be more value-oriented, more growth-oriented, a career at a MM, a career at an SM, a career at a LO, and lots more flavors of investing.\n\nThoughts?",

      "selftext": "I've wanted to get into the stock trading game for a while now, but I didn't know where to start. Going back to 2013/2014, AMD was under $2 a share, and I thought about investing $1000 just to see what would happen over the years. Same with GoDaddy when it IPO'd. Same with Tesla back in March (looks like TESLA's share price jumped 4x in the past couple of months?).\n\nI ended up not buying any shares because I didn't know where to begin, or what kind of caveats to ask. I ended up putting that money into a Roth IRA, so it's working for me in some way, but that's the slow game. After some thought, here are some questions I've come up with as well as some context to these questions:\n\n* **Is this sub a good place for asking basic questions about stocks?** Judging from the posts that I've seen so far, I'm under the impression that this sub is geared more towards more experienced stock traders, and not for complete beginners such as myself.\n* **Does anyone recommend any good resources for a total beginner like myself?** I've asked friends and family about how stocks work in general, but I have so questions about how to think about money, stocks, valuation, etc. but I haven't taken a course or read any books on the stock market yet either. I'm sure a book or 3 could answer a lot of these questions.\n* **Where do I buy stock?** Friends have told me that I can go to places such as Robinhood or etrade, but what are the differences between them? I don't mean to incite a flame war with: \"which is the best to start?\" but should there be things/preferences that I should be thinking of when choosing to make an account? **OR** Should I just pick one, create an account, and start investing?\n* **What kinds of fees should I expect?** Do these sites get a commission on the sale of stock? Should I always be mindful when selling my stock? In my previous example above: Tesla's share price is 4 times what it was in early-March (according to a lazy Google search). If I actually did buy stock at that time, and cashed out today, would I be getting roughly 4x as much cash, but then there's capital gains taxes and stock commissions, right?",

Losing money is part of the game and short term losses are completely fine. I’ve since chatted with many young investors who gained confidence though my post. That’s extremely satisfying to me. I’m very glad I could boost their confidence. It really has been an amazing journey. Started Reddit this year because COVID has me under constant lockdown. (I’m in the at risk group) And most people have been extremely nice. I know that I don’t have the magical advice to make you rich overnight but sometimes encouraging words are all we need. Basic human connections are the best cure for confidence. Someone telling you that “You’ll make it” is an amazing feeling. Everyone deserves that. And if you invest conservatively you’ll gain money long term. I realized that though my rather special upcoming and my net worth I’m not able to fully relate to most people. But I’ll not let that divide me from the rest of the world. Frankly I’m happy to chat to everyone of you guys. It’s fresh and exiting to see young people with so much will to achieve financially stability. Im honestly proud of the modern generation.

Generally, when it comes to investing, the obvious choices are, well, obvious; however, they tend to be more expensive.  For people who are risk averse and are more interested in slowly building a portfolio over a long period of time as opposed to looking for quick trades (5+, 10+ years), I hope we can share some knowledge and connect over some opportunities that we see / are considering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.  Nokia (\\~3.8 dollars).  They're trying to make moves in the 5G space.  They lost a deal with VZ, I believe, which is causing their dip.  However, they're not out of the picture.  With positive earnings from their last quarter and with continued pressure against Huawei, Nokia may have more opportunities to come.\n2. Ford (\\~6.7 dollars).  Change in management officially began today.  The new CEO took over and has made a promise to restructure their operations and overhaul their stagnant executive management.  It was a much needed change, and something I'm considering as a plus factor.\n3. PG&amp;E (\\~9.5 dollars).  They've had a rough past few years due to all of the litigation based on their negligent conduct, however they recently came out of bankruptcy and they've restructured their management and operations.  PG&amp;E is one of the biggest utility providers on the West Coast and I don't think they're going anywhere anytime soon.  Yes, much of their conduct is subject to regulation, but I think that's a smaller risk factor considering the price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs always, I'm not trying to suggest that we ALL-IN on any one of these stocks.  But opening, maintaining small positions and building over time.  What are your thoughts?  What would you add to the list?",

Yet, given the steadiness of their high dividend yields and the current discounted share price, it still seems like they would be solid buys. Any thoughts on these utility funds? I'm leaning more towards just going with NEE after their stock split, but I quite like higher yield, and NEE basically just keeps up with inflation in that regard... despite it being the biggest holding of both funds.",

Blindly follow the 'time in the markets' sentiment and believe that one day they will reach 2019 prices again.\n\n2) Believe that the era of peak oil prices has passed. Accept that 500p will never be reached again and hope for an exit point with a bearable loss (maybe over 400p).\n\n3) Dollar Cost Average. Take a calculated risk to lower my weighted share price in the hope that oil prices and BP shares recover.\n\n4) Run. BP is shifting their entire business model towards a less profitable form of energy production. Dust myself down and use it as a lesson for the future.\n\nSo, over to you.

Recently the stock dropped from £220 to £130 in a day and split with another stock IAGN which was worth £70, overall it was worth £200 then. I read that this was due to a company rights issue and I had nothing to worry about. Now IAGN has dropped to £10 and after looking for the past couple of days is not even on the market anymore. IAG dropped a bit due to recent covid worries which is understandable, my stock is now worth £90.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure National Banks are allowed to allocate 20% of their loans to affiliates (brokerage division).\n\nToday,  this logic has been further confirmed by the incomprehensible stock market rally that occurred in the midst of the largest worldwide economic shutdown in human history; the worst gdp quarter in American history; and while unemployment surges during record bankruptcies.  Truly sick.  \n\nNone of this is rocket science either, and as the President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, he of all people should know this better than anybody. \n\nIs it time to flag this man as a potential purveyor of fake news?

      "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 5th, 2020.\n\n# **Trump’s health and fiscal stimulus fight will steer the markets in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/trumps-health-and-the-fiscal-s.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump’s health and the state of a fiscal stimulus package will be the main focus for markets in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; In the early morning hours Friday, President Donald Trump tweeted that he and the first lady tested positive for Covid. Stocks sold off hard, but the S&amp;P 500 came off its lows in Friday trading and closed down just under 1%. It was up 1.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; The market was helped by signs that a stimulus package is still a possibility, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked airlines not to furlough workers. She promised either a stand alone aid bill, or a bigger negotiated relief legislation that would help the industry.\n*****\n&gt; “The market is going to watch health updates from the White House medical staff, and it’s going to watch how the president communicates with the public,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives at BTIG. “Will we see him in person in the next week in any form? What’s his volume of tweets? All as a way to first gauge the severity of the case.”\n*****\n&gt; Trump and Melania Trump are reported to have mild cases, but as time goes on the market will turn to how the illness could impact the presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; Former Vice President Joe Biden gained slightly in the polls after the first debate Tuesday night, and now the calendar for further debates is in question. The market has seemingly warmed to Biden, and even though he would raise taxes, it is assumed Democrats would quickly pass a major infrastructure package if there is a Democratic sweep of Congress.\n*****\n&gt; Trump, however, is widely seen on Wall Street as stronger on the economy and better for markets.\n*****\n&gt; “What you’ve done from a campaign perspective, is you’ve taken away the thing that gives him the most energy - his ability to interact with crowds,” said Emanuel. “The president had wanted to paint the economic recovery of the last three or four months as the cornerstone, and this basically puts the virus back as topic number 1, number 2 and number 3. And it’s all the more so because the data is coming in weaker than expected.”\n*****\n&gt; The market is fixated on the prospect of stimulus to help business, the unemployed and state and local governments. The House passed a $2.2 trillion package this week, but there is still no agreement with Republicans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pushed for a $1.6 trillion package.\n*****\n&gt; “I think there’s an underlying bid under the market because nobody wants to be super short if we get a stimulus approved, but you can’t be too long in case his mild symptoms turn into severe symptoms,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com. “We’re in a tough spot but overall we’re still pretty constructive.”\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the fact the president is now ill could hurt confidence and slow down some of the improvement in the economy.\n*****\n&gt; “The underlying tone is, again, whether its directly or later, there’s going to be stimulus,” Emanuel said. ”’Whether it’s this month or November, this reinforces the need for stimulus because the president falling ill signals to, at the margin, the person whose thinking about going out to dinner to think again. It’s a significant economic and psychological hindrance.”\n*****\n&gt; Also coming up in the week ahead is a speech Tuesday by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to the National Association of Business Economists.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also expected to push for the stimulus package to boost the economy so the recovery does not stall.\n*****\n&gt; “I think his whole objective is to try to get Congress and the Administration to sign onto a fiscal rescue package,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “He’ll all but come out and say [the recovery] is not a ‘V.’ Without additional support from lawmakers, risks are pretty high that we backtrack. I think that’s the kind of outlook he’s going to give. It’s going to be full-throated.”\n*****\n&gt; September’s employment report, released Friday, was seen by some as a warning that the economy is not rebounding as expected. There were 661,000 jobs added in September, well below the 800,000 expected.\n*****\n&gt; Besides Powell, there are a half dozen other Fed speakers. There are also minutes from the Fed’s last minute released Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3J0V6o1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TI8ImmZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/90v084y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne7m07y.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UZt0DJ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HA7KsPc.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NzmRLPp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eqS3Lk4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/k9v1hZX.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UtkozzH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KNI9qkQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/OM44UFj.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Make Up Your !@#$%^&amp;* Mind!\n\n&gt; We've all had versions of this conversation where you or the person you were talking to just couldn't make up their mind. At the end of the day, it only causes trouble and plans are ruined.\n\n&gt; The market is having its own back and forth this year trying to decide between growth and value. Just today, growth stocks are getting slaughtered while value stocks are up marginally. As an example, the Russell 1000 Growth index is down 1.8% on the day while the Russell 1000 Value index has managed to rally 0.25%. The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the Russell 1000 Growth index and the Russell 1000 Value index for each day in 2020. Today's performance spread between the two indices marks the ninth time this year that value has outperformed growth by more than two percentage points. At the other extreme, there have also been eight trading days where growth outperformed value by more than two percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-2020.png))**\n\n&gt; So how does this year's frequency of days where the performance spread between the two indices was more than two percentage points stack up to other years? The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the two indices going all the way back to 1990. Over the last thirty years, the only two periods where we saw a frequency of these large daily dislocations was back in 2008 and the period spanning 2000 and 2001. In fact, with 17 days this year where the performance spread between the two indices was greater than two percentage points, the only other years that saw a higher frequency of large dislocations were 2000 (54) and 2001 (28). If you think the market has been indecisive this year, in 2000 we saw these types of daily dislocations an average of once per week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-All-Years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term “Octoberphobia” has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don’t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n&gt; But October has become a turnaround month—a “bear killer” if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October’s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Have Democratic Sweeps Meant for the S&amp;P 500?\n\n&gt; Headed into the first presidential debate Tuesday night, betting markets (ElectionBettingOdds.com) placed Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the slight favorite to take the White House in November. The debate resulted in Biden gaining another 5 percentage point chance of winning the Presidency. As of this morning, Biden's odds to win are at 59.8% versus Trump's odds of 38.9%. Additionally, Democrats are slight favorites to win control of the Senate (58.4% to 41.5%) and big favorites to maintain the House (82.8% to 17.1%). Given these odds, in the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the three months before Election Day through three months after Election Day for all election years post-WWII that resulted in a sweep of the executive and legislative branch by the Democrats.\n\n&gt; As shown, on average the S&amp;P 500 has been on the decline in the weeks leading up to Election Day, though in the days just before the Election there has been a small rally that sharply reverses once the results come in. After the initial post-Election drop, the market has trended a bit higher, but by three months after the Election, it has only found itself around the same levels as Election Day; on average a 2.6% loss versus where the index stood three months prior.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps3.png))**\n\n&gt; The composite shown above is comprised of six different years: 1948, 1960, 1964, 1976, 1992, and 2008. While on average the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower, it is not necessarily a sure-fire thing. For example, 1948 and 2008 were the only years that saw the S&amp;P 500 trade and stay significantly lower in the wake of the election. In 1976, there was similarly a sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the election, but the index did make its way back up to the highs of that six-month time frame later on albeit no new high was put in place. Meanwhile, 1960, 1964, and 1992 all saw the S&amp;P 500 run higher after the election even despite some periods of consolidation after initial moves higher. In our B.I.G. Tips report from Tuesday, we show these same charts for all Presidential election years post WWII including a look at the average performance given every potential election outcome.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Current Returns Stack Up to History\n\n&gt; Even after September's weakness, the S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month total return stood at an impressive 14.9%. Given the events of the last 12 months, one could even say that performance is remarkable. What's even crazier is that the S&amp;P 500's performance over the last 12 months is more than three times stronger than the 12 month period before that (+4.25%). The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's annualized total returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares that performance to the historical average return of the index over those same time periods.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's historical average 12-month return is 11.7%, so the current 14.9% gain exceeds that average by more than three full percentage points. Over a two-year window, though, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 9.4% is more than a full percentage point below the historical average. Looking further out, the S&amp;P 500's trailing five and ten-year annualized return has been much stronger than average, which makes sense given the long bull market we were in. Over a 20 year window, though, the S&amp;P 500 is only just starting to work off some of the declines from the dot-com bust and as a result, the 6.4% annualized gain is a four and a half percentage points below the long-term average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show how the current performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each of the time frames shown compares to all other periods on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's performance over the last year, ranks just below 56th percentile of all other periods, while the two-year performance ranks just below the 42nd percentile. Even as the five and ten-year periods have seen well above average returns, they still rank in just the mid-60s on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's ranking over a 20-year time period is a completely different story ranking in single-digits on a percentile basis. Even with the equity market right near record highs, the last two decades have been forgettable for US equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns-Ranks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonals Are Back In Style Again\n\n&gt; There is no denying that market seasonality has not worked so well this year. But we have been here before and history is on our side. Over the long term, intermediate term and short term market seasonality has suffered brief periods when seasonality was overridden by more powerful forces. The COVID pandemic and economic shutdown certainly qualifies. But it is only a matter of time until repetitive human behavior patterns and people and institutions return to moving money around in the usual daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and seasonal patterns.\n\n&gt; The return of perennial September weakness is emblematic of a return to normal market behavior and a reflection of the fact that despite the continuing concerns about surges in coronavirus cases life is beginning to return to normal. In our area, about 25-30 miles north of New York City, our kids are beginning hybrid learning, playing rugby, lacrosse and other sports (yes with some COVID protocols, but tackling and facing-off), golf outings are happening and people are going to restaurants and out and about.\n\n&gt; The chart here shows the historical One-Year Pattern of the S&amp;P 500 Since 1950 versus 2020. The black line shows the seasonal pattern since 1950. The blue represents the pattern since 1988. We use 1988 as it is the first year after the 1987 Crash when the market underwent a major systemic change with the implementation of downside protection circuit breakers and collars. It is noteworthy how the seasonal pattern persists during both the 70-year and 31-year timeframes.\n\n&gt; 2020 is plotted on the right axis due to the magnitude of the move this year. The yellow box highlights the rebirth of seasonality this September, especially during this notoriously negative Week After Triple Witching Week as detailed page 108 of the 2020 Almanac, indicated by the two black arrows\n\n&gt; Years like 1980, 1982, 2009 and 2016 with unseasonably early weakness and bear markets like 2020 returned to normal seasonal patterns in short order. And years like 1954, 1958, 1980, 1982, 1995 and 2009 that exhibited double-digit gains in the Worst Six Months still proceeded to deliver further sizable gains in the subsequent Best Six Months (page 52, STA 2020). We believe the return of market seasonality is upon us. So remain cautious through the end of September and be alert to Octoberophobia, but remain ready to pounce on our Best Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal, when it triggers.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0a4a6ba18e7d903b198c8fa7d6cf8bc4/9c2d30c4da9ff340-d7/s500x750/eb0c36b5ff7eec394f463ca8420054c22a88010f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 2nd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$RGP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/E7qqUjk.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zy3ktow.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pt0NiLh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yaviiRp.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Vdaqsaj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ipdesH4.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Domino's Pizza, Inc. $433.78\n**Domino's Pizza, Inc.

Their stock is current sitting at ~9.50. I know that when dividends get paid out, the stock price adjusts accordingly, but if I didn't care about the stock price and only about the dividend income, wouldn't that be a pretty solid long term investment plan? Assuming you rolled over the dividends into more shares and continued adding to your shares occasionally, you could potentially me making thousands of dollars a year strictly on dividends. \n\nSo is there really a downside to this assuming the company didn't lower their dividend rates or fold for some reason?",

I was really interested in BA but wanted to wait to see what happened after sept 15th and that wasn't great. Great buy but will take years so I am watching for now. Some others I have been following are V/MA, FDX (although getting pricey), J&amp;J and CVS.

Big Auto was happy to sit back and watch Tesla try to create a new segment. But now, almost every carmaker has announced significant electric-vehicle ambitions for the coming decade.\n\nMake no mistake: Without Tesla, this wouldn't be happening. We'd still be asking the circa 2006 question, \"Who killed the electric car?\" if Tesla hadn't reset the EV race in the years before the financial crisis, narrowly avoided bankruptcy, and positioned itself to deliver half a million vehicles in 2021 (and gift investors with a 9,200% return).\n\nNow, the global EV market is poised to grow, especially in China, where auto sales are already millions more annually than in the US, with the potential to top out at twice what the US sees every year, around 16-17 million new cars, trucks, and SUVs. A large percentage of those new sales could be electric, and automakers don't want Tesla to capture them all.",

Just a few minutes ago i received a message from them apologising and gave me back all the money that i had lost in palantir calls. \n\nI posted this to tell you to NEVER TRUST YOUR BROKER. They may take money from you without you even noticing that its gone. Always check your orders. If i didn't talked to customer services that day i would have ended up losing all that money. \n\n\n[http://imgur.com/gallery/MQ3aSFF](http://imgur.com/gallery/MQ3aSFF)",

Where as fundamental you're actually researching the reasons why you expect the price to change, and therefor have more evidence and base for making more reliable trades and apparently they dont according to this study [https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20and%20Learning%20110217.pdf](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20and%20Learning%20110217.pdf). \n\nTherefor in my eyes, why would you day trade and do structural  trading when fundamental actually has reasoning and more thought behind it and so is way more likely to be profitable\n\nSo how do people make reliable profits trading structurally and not fundamentally?\n\nsry if noob dumb question",

CFO is from PwC, the second most conservative of the Big 4 Audit firms\n4. Anchor Purchase of the ERX is already in the Books by Agility, a company part owned by the Kuwait Government, and they are also investors in the company.\n\nIn terms of price action, note that larger Instituitional investors are generally NOT allowed to purchase shares at the moment, as the company Market Cap is below US 1 Billion and the merger has not gone through.\n\nNote as well that there is currently USD 4-5 trillion sitting on the sidelines awaiting to enter the market hence a massive stock crash is unlikely, as there is too muck liquidity to prop the market up Hence i my projection might well be it hitting around 150+ or more\n\nfinal price point for Hyliion\n\nAssume 20% share and profitability stay the same and no Dilution but rather reinvestment to produce this\n\nProfit = 6,070,000,000\n\nP/E ratio (no longer growth but value) = 20 times\n\nMarket Cap = 121,400,000,000\n\nNo of share = 179,936,788\n\nfinal price = 674.68\n\npossibility to hit this in 10 years = 85%. in Addition to the above, which was done in aug, new data involved include\n\n1. Andrew H card is the former Bush transport secretary and young bush COS. He will not join any random company unless it is truly strong, hence this is another stamp of approval\n2. Robert M night is going to bring some contracts to Hyliion. he is a director of Schneider and they have a massive fleet [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schneider\\_National](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schneider_National)\n3. Nikola has been exposed as a scam. this leaves Tesla and Hyliion as the main players in this area. however, even bill gates has said that for long Haul there needs to be on board power generation. this is logical due to the nature of work. hence i believe Hyliion has an edge over tesla in this area. even battery day, while showing massive improvements in battery, is still insufficent to overcome this range issue\n\nPS: Apologies for any grammatical mistakes",

Then he turned and appeared to stop at another house on a separate block as I headed on my way. How the fuck is any company going to truly compete with amazon. Unless Walmart plus or anyone just opens a online warehouse for delivery in every region that operates similarly I don’t see how anyone can compete with them. \n\nI work for a chain retail auto parts company in hodunkville.  Cant even tell you how many customers a day try to have us price match amazon or rock auto).  Amazon rapes us on everything and many many people  already has prime so if we have to order something for a customer what incentive does customer have to order from us and not get it for literally 1/4 of price in many cases.  Auto parts are something a lot of people don’t realize amazon sells if they aren’t a DIY person already. \n\nMy point is that amazon will take no fucking prisoners and literally wipe the floor with anyone who tried to out innovate them. It makes me honestly think about getting a management position with them in the factory about 30 min from me.

There were days in the beginning when I had it that I would feel temporarily back to normal, then quickly like hell again.

Without boots on the ground, some market watchers are concerned about the quality of drugs flowing across U.S. borders, and now a university pharmacy is taking matters into its own hands. \n\nResearchers at the University of Kentucky filed a petition with the FDA to recall one lot each of Mylan and Hikma's versions of injectable diuretic acetazolamide after finding high impurity levels in tested lots, the university said last week.\nAfter testing performed in August, the researchers found that samples of Mylan's version of acetazolamide contained only between 80% and 87% of the listed active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The rest was composed of unknown impurities that UK HealthCare Chief Pharmacist Philip Almeter called \"obscure chemicals that could result from breakdown of product or from reagents used in the manufacturing process.\" \n\nIn some cases, the impurity levels in Mylan's version were more than seven times higher than the FDA's accepted amount, Almeter said in an email. Those findings were later confirmed by AMRI, a contract manufacturer and independent testing lab, the university said.\n\"There is little to no data on what danger these (impurities) pose because they have not been studied,\" Almeter said. \"Given the unknowns we felt it was important to file the petition with the FDA as soon as possible.\" \nMylan's version of the injectable was manufactured in India, researchers said, and Hikma's version was made in Portugal. Representatives for both drugmakers could not be reached for comment by press time. \nMylan and Hikma are just two of just three manufacturers on the U.S. market for injectable acetazolamide, which Almeter called \"concerning\" for patients on the drug.\nSo far, researchers have not received side effects reports from patients, but the university's healthcare system has pulled supply of those drugs off shelves. The UK HealthCare Pharmacy is believed to be just one of two pharmacies quality testing their supplies of medicines, the university said.\nUK touted its role as an independent testing lab as the FDA has severely curtailed international inspections amid the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nIn July, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, M.D., said the administration would resume \"prioritized\" domestic manufacturing inspections after a four-month moratorium on most on-site walkthroughs. Meanwhile, inspections abroad have been held on a \"mission critical\" basis, with overseas manufacturers even calling for the FDA to resume inspections to keep the supply chain running. \nThe Kentucky researchers pointed to that overseas ban in their petition, noting that an extended delay on inspections could leave blind spots in drug quality. \n\"We value the work the FDA is doing to ensure quality in our drug supply chain; however, we know this task can be difficult to accomplish given that manufacturing is a globalized business and the FDA has a much more difficult task at hand today than they did 20 years ago,\" Almeter said. \n\n\n\nhttps://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/mylan-hikma-versions-injectable-diuretic-recommended-for-recall-by-kentucky",

One of the good things about the amount of uncertainty in the economy right now is interest rates are historically low and expected to stay there for several years.

They announced a Dutch Auction tender offer to buy back up to $250M worth of shares ($22.50-$26.50). Before the announcement the stock was heavily shorted at about 9M shares of the 40.5M outstanding. After the announcement of the Dutch Auction the short float actually increased to over 10M, despite the stock going up about 15%. I'm trying to understand what the short play is, especially after the announcement.  \n\nIf AMCX can get $250M worth of shares tendered that puts them at between 29M and 31M shares outstanding. If the stock price doesn't budge after the tender is complete (10 days from now) it puts AMCX at an TTM EPS of around $4.60 and a PE of about 5.  \n\nEven if they can't get $250M worth of shares tendered they are likely to just dump that money into their buyback program and grab them on the open market.\n\nShorts, what am I missing here?

      "selftext": "This is my latest investment. I’ll not include numbers because I want to avoid clickbait. My investment strategy this year consists of 4 Phases. 1 Phase was to sell and hold my assets I’m Cash or Bonds. I sold in January and held my assets in US-Dollar, Euro, Pound Sterling and Bond ETFs like BLV. Phase 2 was to reinvest while the market was crashing. This took place in March. Now that Phase 2 is complete, Phase 3 will start. Phase 3 is basically international investment. Since the US has more or less recovered, I’ll be putting my money into non-US markets for now. Starting with Korean banks. Very cheap and undervalued. The stocks were chosen though FA not TA. \n\nKorean Banks I invested in: \n\n-KB @ $33.83\n-SHG @ $24.20\n-WF @ $22.13\n\nAlso I’m currently awaiting for permission form the South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service to trade on the KRX. Legal procedure will take a couple days to one week. My Korean subsidiary is already set up and waiting for permission. \n\nStock I’ll buy then: \n\n-086790.KS\n-035720.KS\n\nThe FA isn’t over for all the potential stocks. That list is incomplete for now. \n\nFurthermore, I’ll reinvest some amount of cash in bonds. But not in actual single bonds but bond ETFs. Since I don’t need that much liquidity for that I’ll stick to one Bond ETF like BLV. It’s 50/50 Cooperate/Government.\n\nAll of the investments are supposed to be held 2+ years. I’ll update how this goes. Phase 2 was very successful and Phase 3 hopefully will be too. \nPhase 4 will be a reactive Phase rather than an active Phase. I’ll react to market movement and adjust my investments then. \nObviously, this is meant for long term hold. \n\nI’m eager to hear what you guys think about it. My team has worked around 500 hours on this. Obviously, there is the legal work with the Koreans and more stocks will come when I finally get access to the KRX. Thanks for being nice and if I misspelt anything please tell me.\nI love you guys it’s honestly amazing how you welcomed me into the community ❤️",

The market has topped and if you bought tesla or apple near to its peak you will probably not recover your investment for few more years. Don't throw good money after bad. Close your trade regardless and be patient. Shorts are really dangerous to play at the moment. You could recover some of your loss later when tesla and apple completely lose strength. Probably between Feb and April.\n\nMost of you guys will say to make money in stock you need to have patience.

There are a lot of reasons to want exposure to renewables that we’ve discussed before. Here’s why I think you should invest in ICLN and do it before the end of October\n\n1. Most renewables (particularly solar) are actually cost competitive with almost every other form of energy. In most of the US, the cost of residential solar per kWh is less than half of the kWh cost of utility generated power. This is beginning to put tremendous pricing pressure on oil and natural gas. The long term economics favor wind and solar. \n \n2. State corporation commissions are rolling out robust renewable energy and efficiency standards, including states that haven’t traditionally espoused political interest surrounding climate change. Arizona for example recently unveiled a major REST update that will substantially accelerate the states transition to renewables. \n\n3. Major renewable energy companies like PLUG and RUN are maturing. The solar industry in particular burned a lot of investors as young companies struggled to establish themselves in a volatile market heavily reliant on government subsidy. That’s no longer the case. There are several mature market players that are highly stable, have dynamic leadership, and have proven they can execute amidst changing market conditions. They are well represented in ICLN. \n\n4. The politics of climate change are settling. This year alone Pew found that 67% of Americans don’t believe government response to climate change has been good enough, 63% believe stricter environmental laws are worth the cost, and for the first time in history a majority of Americans identify climate change as a major issue for them. \n\n5. Joe Biden is going to win the election. This might bring some heat, but I don’t care. Even a polling error of the same magnitude of 2016 results in a resounding Biden win. The election is actively happening and Biden is winning in every major battleground. This is why timing is important - a Biden administration (with a narrow democratic majority in the senate) will be caged in on what they can accomplish. An easy political win with bipartisan appetite includes major infrastructure/energy investments, extensions of tax credits for renewables, and a return to reciprocal trade policy on renewable imports. I expect the entire sector to surge with a Biden win. Like it, hate it, I don’t care - this has nothing to do with my politics and everything to do with my bottom line.",

I’ve also learned that posting without numbers doesn’t get high traction. In order to spread the advice as high as I can I’ll include numbers from now on. \nFor example my latest investment has almost no traction. But I want people to get all the information. My latest investments are only a couple days old and already profitable. Anyone who would’ve emulated me would have made money. Now I feel bad for not trying to spread it more. \n\nAnyways this particular post is for any questions regarding Stress while trading, Trading Strategies, How to find investments, evaluating investments, etc. Just ask per comment or chat me privately. \n\nMy Oct 6 [investment](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j665jm/oct_2020_investments/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) was in Korean banks and has generated around $20k since yesterday. I also bought a bond ETF called BLV which currently is -$3k. Overall profit $17k in one day. But since I’m planning to hold them for +2 years, it’s unrealized profit. Screenshots of my portfolio [upper half](https://imgur.com/AmIaNDW) and [lower half](https://imgur.com/tTWjeqg). The Korean bank tickers are: KB, SHG and WF. \n\nBesides that today’s earnings how that losses and gains are both temporary if you invest long term. I could very well lose 2 million tomorrow. The key is to hold on. Anyways any questions are welcome. But maybe read my past posts on /stocks first so you don’t ask twice. Also personal questions are fine, many seem to be interested. But it should mainly be for the questions I wrote about earlier. I hope we can learn and grow together. The original reason I came to Reddit for was to make my lockdown happier.

      "selftext": "Off the top, this post has been straight ripped from another sub, but the DD is solid with sources included\n\n1. JOE owns 177,000 acres of PRIME Florida Panhandle, Walton County (Hamptons of Florida - think white beaches for miles) real estate, 110,000 acres of that is contiguous. They are the state’s 2nd largest private landholder.\n\n2. The development of these lots costs them approx. $45k and these lots were selling at minimum $95k+ (empty lots)… Overall, JOE has + 170,000 homes, +22 million square feet of commercial space, over 3,000 hotel rooms allotted, and is currently building new developments. (Since the majority of their assets are lots prepped for development a hurricane is not a major concern and it won't land anywhere close to JOE properties).\n\n3. Management has put the pace of lot sales as expected to exceed 1000+ lots / homes a year by 2021, this represents a massive increase from the 390 lots they sold in 2019. I think they could sell even more than 1000 in 2020...\n\n4. Why more than 1000 lots? First of all, by 20Q2 they’ve already sold 867. Walton County, where JOE owns almost all of the remaining salable land, is the 4th fastest growing county in the US and is on pace to see 3000+ sales in 2020. Further, Florida has the highest domestic net migration rate in the US and the 7th population adjusted rate (indicates real estate supply to demand favours demand, therefore prices rise), no income, no estate, no capital gains tax and better weather than NYC. Financial firms in the past 5 years have already been moving to Florida to realize these benefits, COVID has turned this up to 11 as people leave crowded Manhattan, Seattle, etc for Florida and Texas. In particular, they are leaving cities for the exact mix of land JOE owns. Management describes this as “massive momentum”. They are seeing 100% lease rates on their new properties. JOE could easily sell 1000 lots in Q3 alone (and they aren’t running out of lots anytime soon).\n\n5. JOE has already doubled their Q2 net income vs 2019. Imagine what they are going to post in Q3 with the sales growth spurred by COVID (not captured in Q2) on top of their natural growth of 2x. This is while JOE’s fixed costs have grown less than 5% (Q2 YTD vs 2019).\n\n6. JOE also trades at a mid-single digit FFO multiple looking out a few years. Even worst-in-class REITs have higher forward multiples, despite negligible growth prospects and high financial leverage, meanwhile JOE has a net cash balance sheet and great assets!\n\n7. JOE is also COVID resistant, their resort properties are still growing! This is due to the staycation (drive-to) trend. June 2020 resort revenue grew 19% vs. June 2019. Their forestry products division has grown 170% in Q2 vs 2019 while keeping costs relatively equal.\n\n8. Funnily enough, there are people leaving New York to move to Florida (during this pandemic too, lol). Purchases of +1mm are up 88% in Miami-Dade currently. Pairing these together, it’s not wrong to conclude that there is lots of money moving to Florida as of right now, and in the future as well.\n\n9. Alternative data suggests that the cost of a U-Haul from New York to Florida for a 4 bedroom home is $3.5k however, Florida to New York is $780.\n\nOverall, JOE is a supremely undervalued stock. I say this because it's GAAP financials do not reflect the core growth (nor the COVID-based growth) of the business. This is due to a number of single instance line items impacting the top and bottom lines in 2017-2019.\n\nConclusion: I expect that JOE will report strong Q3 earnings. There are 2 ways to utilize the stock:\n\nBuy now and hold until Q3 earnings. Sell here.\n\nBuy Now and hold for 1-2 years if you believe in Florida real estate.\n\nDisclaimer: Currently holding JOE equity.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://ir.joe.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-q/0001558370-20-008668\n\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/markets/its-joetime\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/06/11/new-york-realestate-miami-exodus-pandemic-and-protests/?fbclid=IwAR3wCsE2mOARCT2Tp0lFAIrqMmRijFq-l6lTvx7gGZY9B6CaN4qM7l85LkM#4b47904f55dc\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-31/new-yorkers-flee-for-florida-and-texas-as-mobility-surges?fbclid=IwAR2EgDN4ksu1SCO4HHjWUb1vf-iYbqg5_eIz4RvUR1H59h9Z9o4gUivvwEU\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-31/new-york-s-wealthiest-flocking-to-florida-e",

I'm currently focusing on dividend stocks but I have FOMO about growth stocks; I don't wanna miss out on the Teslas of the world. At the same time, I fear that if I invest in newer, up and coming companies, I could lose more money than I'd be comfortable with and I'd forfeit years of dividends compounding from companies like $KO or $PEP. I'm a conservative investor but I'm thinking that maybe I should take more risk considering my age.\n\nI'm interested to hear from people who have had money in the market for longer than I.

Influenced by WT's suggestions I first got a demo for the Lightspeed Trader and then DAS Trader. I just cannot get used to these platforms. It might just be because I have been using Sterling Trader every day for 3 months now, but it feels a lot more intuitive to me, the graphs are a lot cleaner and it just doesn't have a lot of the stuff that, especially Lightspeed Trader, distracts me with (and which I would never use). \n\nSo now I am thinking about actually getting started with a Broker like Lightspeed, Cobra Trading, ... and get access to the Sterling Trader Pro Platform. I know that the software fee is comparably high, but what are 200$ if you can be a lot more successful on this platform, right? \n\nI just wanted to hear some opinions about the platform from people that have been trading via Sterling Trader Pro in the real market.

U.S.-listed shares of Canopy Growth Corp (WEED.TO), Aphria Inc (APHA.TO) and Aurora Cannabis Inc (ACB.TO) closed between 10% and 13% higher.\n\nEven though many U.S. states have legalized marijuana use, banks and other traditional financial institutions have so far largely refused to work with the industry as cannabis is still a classified substance at the federal level.\n\n\"Access to safe banking will transform the industry, freeing up capital markets for investment and reducing the risk of operating a cannabis business,\" said Keith Cich, co-founder of cannabis-related products manufacturer Sunderstorm Inc.\n\nRegulatory issues have also restricted cash availability for companies in the nascent sector at a time when they are struggling with a lack of profitability due to high costs.\n\n\"From a business perspective, (decriminalization) will level the playing field by allowing companies to expense normal operational costs instead of being taxed on gross profit,\" said Sam Armenia, vice president at producer C21 Investments Inc (CXXI.CD).\n\nHarris, who has supported cannabis decriminalization even before Biden picked her as his running mate, is the lead sponsor of the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act of 2019, which sought to end federal prohibition of marijuana.\n\n[Source](https://www.reuters.com/article/cannabis-stocks-idUSKBN26U071)",

While the competitors are lugging around enormous debt (between 25 and 50% of last year’s sales), things are looking much better at Southwest.\n\nDebt is exceptionally low for the industry and only corresponds to annual profit or a tenth of sales (rounded). So Southwest works sustainably.\n\nEvery year, huge sums of capital flow out of the other airlines, keyword:  \n**Interest rates**  \nThis money is being lost to investors. In the long term, this results in enormous wealth effects, which of course are reflected in the share price.\n\nSouthwest is likely to be the outperformer in the future. So if you want to bet on a rebound in the sector, then you’ve come to the right place.\n\nAs long as the stock is trading above $ 38, a possible rise again to $ 40 and 42 could happen at any time. Above that, the way would be clear towards $44 and $46.\n\nFor countercyclical investors, things get interesting near $36. This is where the long-term support zone begins, which extends to $30.\n\nwhat do you guys think is southwest a good buy right now?",

      "selftext": "I just read an article on Seeking Alpha on Quantafuel. It was a surprise to me that it isn't yet known in the States. \nQuantafuel is a big name here in the Nordics. \nThey don't have competition yet, and they have on-going cooperation with BASF, the biggest chemical producer in the world. Definitely still undervalued. \n\nStart by googling the Seeking Alpha analysis about Quantafuel from a few days ago.  \n\nThe price is now 58 NOK, around 6 USD. Next week they will be releasing information about their first plant's production, and the price might jump straight to over 100NOK.\n\nOne should also note that the European Union is planning a 800USD/tonne tax on plastics. That means Quantafuel can take in plastic material, AND BE PAID for taking it, while producing and selling high-grade oils for new uses.\n\nGoogle-translated from Norwegian:\n\n\" \"Case significantly de-risked, target upped to 200  \nWe reiterate our Buy recommendation on QFUEL and increase our target price to NOK200  \nfrom NOK50 per share. Over the last month, the investment case has been significantly derisked with 1) the first plant commencing production in Denmark, 2) the output quality  \nbeing well within the expected range for BASF, and 3) QFUEL has raised c.NOK850m  \n(c.USD95m) in two private placements resulting in a strong balance sheet. Going forward,  \nthe investment case will be all about growth, as we estimate that each new facility will have  \na very attractive ROE of &gt;100% and a payback time of two years (USD100m capex and at  \nleast USD50m EBITDA). QFUEL targets to have 6 facilities in operation by 2023, and if we  \nassume 50% ownership, the current share price of NOK66 is equivalent to a P/E of 6.4x. We  \nfind QFUEL highly attractive given the company’s rapid growth opportunities with sound  \neconomy, proprietary technology, ESG profile and three world class strategic partners.  \n• Growth at highly attractive plant economics – Two years payback time  \nTogether with Vitol, world’s largest oil trader, QFUEL has already commenced  \nfeasibility studies of two large scale facilities (100,000t plastic waste per year) in  \nAntwerp and Amsterdam, and QFUEL aims to have 6 facilities in operation by 2023.  \nWe estimate that a plant cost approximately USD100m, and contributes with an  \nEBITDA above USD50m, resulting in a highly attractive payback time of less than two  \nyears. If we take it one step further and assume 60% debt financing at 5% interest, the  \nestimated net profit of c.USD40m gives an unparalleled ROE above 100%.  \n• QFUEL in a few years – P/E below 10x  \nQFUEL will probably grow for many years, and for example its strategic partner BASF  \nconsume naphtha every year equivalent to more than 2,000 times the estimated  \nproduction capacity in Skive. Investing in just a fraction of those plants could give a  \nvalue above NOK1,000 per share, but let’s focus on the short- to medium-term for  \nnow. Thus, we assume that QFUEL reach its target to have 6 facilities in production by  \n2023 at the abovementioned economics. Then QFUEL is estimated to have an EBITDA  \nof NOK1.9bn and net profit of c.NOK1.3bn (EPS of NOK10), resulting in a highly  \nattractive EV/EBITDA of 5.6x and P/E of 6.4x on the current share price of NOK66.  \n• Valuation – TP NOK200 equivalent to a P/E of 20x  \nOur target priced of NOK200 per share is equivalent to a P/E of 20x once the first 6  \nfacilities are operational, if we assume 50% ownership. The valuation range in QFUEL  \nis wide given the strong growth opportunities, but we argue that it all breaks down to  \none thing: if you believe QFUEL will reach anything close to estimated production  \nfigures, the current share price is a highly attractive buying opportunity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-\n\nYou should look the stock up through Quantafuels native Norwegian Oslo Stock exchange, the stock isn't currently traded in US exchanges.  \n\n\nRecent price targets:   \nSpareBank1 200 NOK 18.09.2020  \nDNB 84 NOK 08.09.2020  \nPareto 100 NOK 16.09.2020  \nARTIC SECURITIES 125 NOK 04.09.2020  \nDanske Bank 131 NOK 10.09.2020  \nFearnley Securities 105 NOK 23.09.2020   \n\n\nSimplyWallstreet also have an article about Quantafuel, Google that. \n\n\nPersonally I'm a firm believer in this company, but do not get paid by anyone for presenting this.

Earlier this year, the company that I have my Roth IRA with (Fidelity) randomly stopped allowing me to buy a particular legitimate stock that I am interested in. I have thousands of shares in it, but they no longer allow purchases and will only let you sell it (yeah, right, like I would do that). So I opened a trading account with TD Ameritrade. I do trade a couple of specific OTC stocks, which I know tend to be volatile, but have made me a lot of money because I try to be smart about buying and selling. I've multiplied one of them into 52,000 shares simply by buying low and selling high, then repeating. \n\nCuriously, TD Ameritrade recently sent me a couple of messages about \"cash good faith violations\".\n\nSo, a question: why exactly is two business days required in between each separate buy/sell trade? Are ALL trading accounts like this or do I need a specific one that will allow me to buy when I want/sell when I want (same stock) during the same day or at least the next day? I wasn't that familiar with TD and thought this was what they allowed, but clearly it isn't. These are also for OTC stocks that I'm referring to.\n\nSome kind of overseeing body, per the message, \"requires\" two business days for each buy or sell transaction to separately clear before doing anything else.

Apple got bounced from the top spot after holding it for four-straight quarters, says a just-released quarterly analysis from Apex Clearing, a custody and stock clearing firm. Apex studies more than 1.5 million investment accounts held by people aged 31 years old, on average.\n\nAnd while many might criticize these young investors, they're laughing all the way to the bank. Tesla shares are up 409% this year. That blows away the \"buy-and-hold\" crowd who are up just 6.7% with the S&amp;P 500. Tesla even makes Apple's 56.6% gain this year look so-so. And millennials are the only major generation to make Tesla their top holding. It's No. 2 for Generation Z and Gen X and No. 3 for baby boomers.\n\nMillennials are making money on all but two of their top 10 holdings. And not by just a little. The average year-to-date gain on millennials' top 10 holdings is more than 80%. But to put that into perspective: That's even better than S&amp;P 500 component Amazon.com's (AMZN) 73% rise this year.

Take the remaining 25k and waste it on option and uvxy yolos as well but like......I don't know if I should even bother right now.  I know that no one can predict things etc....but shouldn't things have some kind of correction around end of the year with the election?\n\n\nSitting on this much cash feels wasteful, but at the same point I don't want to go almost 100k into some etf's only with the possibility of a 30% correction coming.\n\n\nI guess the question is \"is there a more than normal chance that we have a biiiig dip/correction?

I work for a university and make good money, and over the acedemic breaks over the summer I joined Etsy to sell some homemade good, and it did extraordinarily well. Now that I have a good positive cash flow, I want to invest and try to grow my money. I don't know much about the stock market, except that March was a good time to buy in lol. I don't know what calls are, I looked at r/wallstreetbets and found too much shit posting, joined in the GME hype and didn't sell out this morning so I ended up losing money on it, but not much at least. I also didn't know that the markets were closed on Saturday. Are they closed Sunday too? Do stocks continue to move during closed times or do they remain stagnant?\n\nTo the point. I'm looking at ETSY, Microsoft, PayPal, shopify, GE. They seem to be doing good, especially etsy which went up like $100 this year. But I don't know what good beginners stocks would be. I already bought into etsy with 1 share and earned a few bucks. But just because they are doing really good at this time, does it seem like a good idea to buy in? Especially during this pandemic with no stimulus anytime soon (I'm in the US), I'm afraid of the stocks falling again, but not too worried, sound like if they fall just buy in maybe?\n\nWhat are good strategies to find out what stocks are best? Do I follow certain companies closely to find out what moves they will make? How do I know if what they will do is going to be beneficial? What kind of things should I be looking out for? and finally, what strategies has worked for you?\n\nI'm excited and nervous, losing $300 wouldn't kill me but it would hurt a little.",

      "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; “It looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there’s a will to get something done.”\n*****\n&gt; On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. “It’s really hard to read,” said Keon.\n*****\n&gt; But he said even if there’s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n&gt; “I actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,” said Keon.“We’re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don’t look that bad.”\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&amp;P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n&gt; “Q2 reporting season saw S&amp;P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,” wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n&gt; The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&amp;P 500  down about 10%. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n&gt; “While the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,” they noted.\n*****\n&gt; The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there’s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n&gt; “I think from the market’s perspective, it doesn’t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,” said Keon. “I think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we’re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.”\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n&gt; “There are many moving parts here, and they’re all moving in different directions,” said Block. “It’s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.”\n*****\n&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. “I think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that’s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can’t hurt,” he said.\n*****\n&gt; The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; “That would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,” said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n&gt; In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n&gt; Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n&gt; Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&amp;P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n&gt; As shown, the average stock in the broad S&amp;P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n&gt; The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n&gt; If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&amp;P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are 46 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n&gt; General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # News High for Net New Highs\n\n&gt; Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&amp;P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n&gt; As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&amp;P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Breadth Booming\n\n&gt; One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&amp;P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n&gt; While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n&gt; With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&amp;P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n&gt; October’s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n&gt; With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9deab1b6431375946cf0104830334e3a/1b58acd0d015098f-cf/s500x750/1a07b8cea97519bcce57adae974614a0e426effb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 9th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.11.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/rotewK3.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2lSi1kT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Wj80iaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZY9TwgO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5LizPLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oIstn4O.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKfmmCC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q3isONG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Swqo1ow.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. $101.20\n**JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

In the second quarter, Amazon boosted revenue 33.5% year over year, with its business in North America growing only 2.9% faster than the entire company.\n\nSure, the law of large numbers plays a role here.

However, when I run a VBA on a   spreadsheet that pulls historical data from Yahoo! Finance of the   symbols listed on the aforementioned markets, the ones ending in W come   back \"failed to find historical data\". In addition to not finding data   for stocks ending in \"W\" (i.e. Warrants), I think it's not pulling the   data for preferred stocks because of the actual name of the preferred   stock as listed on Yahoo! Finance is different than the one on my list   (for example, my list might say AGO-B as the prefered stock class B for   the stock AGO, but on Yahoo! Finance, it's listed as AGO-PB, which   explains why it's not finding it).\n\nMy   point is, when researching the covariance of stocks listed on NASDAQ,   NYSE, and NYSE American, does it even matter if I include stock  warrants  and preferred stocks or should I just ignore them?",

Now items that are in stock can be shipped directly to consumers from a network of almost 300 retail stores spread across the U.S. and Canada, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nApple told staff the shift will mean faster delivery times for customers who live further from distribution centers than from stores, according to the people who asked not to be identified discussing internal policies. The products will be shipped through United Parcel Service Inc. in Canada and FedEx Corp. in the U.S. via ground shipping and may be delivered as early as the day after a customer’s order, Apple told its staff. The program will apply to customers who live within 100 miles from a store, the people said.",

Back in 2018, I lost like 40% of my portfolio with the crash, and that year I realized all I can have is only 3k in deductions. \nThis year I've made substantially more, but realizing now I'm going to have to pay up 30% of it, this just seems unfair? \nYes tax is necessary and I'm all for it, but I'd like to think as a citizen investing in companies I'd be more confident knowing the govt has my back if I lose my investment and they can give me a relief. I mean wouldn't that encourage people to invest more, buy stocks and grow the economy? This just feels like oh tough luck you lost 100k on the market? Here's a mere 3k in deductions 🤷🏽‍♂️. Oh you made 100k this year? cool we're going take 1/3 of it now or more 🕴️. \n\nI'm bored and wanted to hear some opinions and tax critics! :) Maybe deductions should be calculated the same rate as gains tax? Or there shouldn't be a short and long term rate but just one rate?",

I have not been investing for a very long time and have ran into all of them and did not have a precesdent to rely on. \n\n1) Of your positions, one is draining dramatically. You believe in the company without doubts, and that it will turn around eventually but realize you bought it at way too high a premium. You also are not positive if you will ever break even in a reasonable time frame but there a solid chance that you may be able to take less of a loss. Consider both the possibility that you may or may not have the funds to continue averaging down.\n\n2) Of your positions, one is running beyond what you think is reasonable. You think there will be a sizeable correction soon but believe in the company long term.\n\n3) You got your paycheck, paid off immediate expenses, monthly expenses, saved a little, and now have a heavy pocket to invest. You did your dd and are considering investing in company A. However it's been green for a little longer than you are comfortable and expect a red day to come. Do you wait for a pullback or just let dd and time in the market take care of it? Let's consider both in shorter term (6-12 weeks) to longer term (3-5 years).\n\n4) You are rebalancing and want to trim your total amount of positions. In order of profit, company A has made you the most, followed by B, C, D, E, F, respectively. Should you cut losers for winners? Take profit on the big wins? What information do I need to consider and understand to make these kinds of decisions?\n\nI understand many of you don't have all day to answer my questions, but if you have a second, I'd appreciate if you could enlighten me on one or two scenarios.

As luck would have it EV mania was in full stride and if your company wasn't working on the next electric-powered anything then you were at best noticed second. As one of America's largest retail grocery chains, ACI has quietly sat in the shadows and raked in the cash during the peak of Covid-19 lockdowns and nationwide non-essential business closures.\n\nFor those that haven't already done their Due Diligence on Albertsons Companies, they have increased same-store sales for 10 straight quarters. Yes, even before covid-19. If anything, they have only benefited from the national safety protocols that were put in place along with non-essential business closures as they were seen as an essential business. Even work from home implementation by thousands of businesses has donated quite heavily to their bottom line.\n\nAs Jim Cramer mentioned in his stock market based television show, Albertsons is not the same company as they were in 2015 or even 2018. **Under their new CEO debt has been reduced by Billions of dollars** and by restructuring their long term debts while federal interest is at /near zero percent they have become a much leaner, and even more efficient company.\n\nThe current PEG ratio that is popular and most referred to when measuring a company's growth tells a story of great potential for ACI investors. **With a PEG at 0.40 it's clear that the unnoticed stock is Extremely undervalued.** For perspective sake, if a company's PEG ratio is 1.0 that would indicate that the price of the stock accurately reflects it's growth. So a PEG of 0.50 would indicate an extreme undervalue on share price. As mentioned earlier, ACI has a PEG of 0.40 currently.\n\nCouple all the aforementioned positive catalysts with the fact that they have also seen a **275% jump in digital sales** since Covid-19 and one can only assume that their earnings report scheduled for October 20, 2020 will be positive.\n\nThe consensus price target by 18 Analysts is $19.50. The high price target is $26.00. From today's entry price of $14.26 a share, this could be a very lucrative buy opportunity for attentive investors. \n\nIn my humble opinion,  Albertsons Companies may be the most promising short and long term stock in my portfolio.",

I have always been a cautious investor, and learned that going the index fund route for all investments is a safe bet, plus with low fees and expense ratios, it seemed like the most bang for buck. That said, the kangaroo stock market has me interested in throwing a bit of money at stocks to see what happens. I put in some money to AMD stock and already have a 25% return since initially investing a few months back. At 28 years old, I feel like I could be a bit more risky.   \nMy understanding is that with the ROTH IRA, any money I make in that account, I will not have to pay taxes or capital gains when withdrawing. Would there be any advantage to dumping funds now that the market is quite high, and waiting to see how rocky this election is? Then buying funds again when there is a dip? With the current political climate, I really can't see the election going smoothly, leading to people selling across the board, regardless of who actually wins. Plus if we get into a constitutional crisis, even more reason to be out of the markets.\n\nAny thoughts on this? Is this a super rookie move, and should I just stick with the bogleheads methods of long term strategy? Can we even have long term strategies in the current day and age?",

He thinks a purchase will have to be comprised of mainly cash funded by debt.\n\nStriking the right balance will be crucial. Raising $10 billion in debt is the absolute maximum AMD should consider, with less being the preferred option, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anand Srinivasan.“The bond market is falling over itself to lend money. This is the time to do it,” he said. But “AMD has made debt reduction a core part of its strategy.”\n\n“Xilinx is one of the last great acquirable assets in semis,” said Chris Rolland, an analyst at Susquehanna. “Other top potential bidders may include Qualcomm and Broadcom. Never count Hock out.”",

Disclaimer: I hate politics influencing the market but here we are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why I think stimulus is not coming**\\- With the last stretch of elections, democrats are not going to give Trump any reason to rejuvenate his base and support. We all know if any stimulus is passed, he is going to celebrate as win and print his face on every single checks which simply is not a good strategy so close to elections for his opposition.\n\nMeanwhile Republicans will do anything in their power to make sure their supreme court nominee is appointed. This will be their only priority before the elections not stimulus.\n\nHowever news about both parties will continue their \"talks and negotiations\" will continue to drive market  optimism.  Both parties will agree to this arrangement for as long as they can.\n\nWith the holiday season coming up, I think travel industry will see an increased traffic and public confidence will improve  especially if Trump has successfully recovered with no adverse effects to special  cocktails of drugs formulated by Regeneron. Covid vaccine delivery timeline will also generate optimism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How will market react?** I have no idea, probably best to have a strategy in place to minimize your risk if it falls drastically.   I think the market will recover post election ( no matter who wins), if and only if covid cases do not increase.  Below is the link of market performance under all past presidents.\n\n[https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/historical/presidential.html](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/historical/presidential.html)\n\nIf your stock portfolio hinges on arrival on stimulus , I would advise to proceed with caution.",

Yes, record, like never before had the bank ever posted that much revenue from trading in its entire operating history!\n\nWay to go JP!!\n\nBut in the midst of a global pandemic and an economic shutdown of the likes the world had never seen, how is it even possible for any company, in any sector for that matter, to be breaking performance records? 2nd quarter 2020 was quite literally the worst GDP quarter in American history, and up to 95% of the country was under some form of a lockdown order. At the time, analysts were even going so far as to compare the unemployment rate to what was seen during not just the Great Recession, but the Great Depression itself!\n\nHow is that possible?!\n\nWell, JPM isn’t just your average company. They enjoy a [unique, and exclusive relationship](https://archive.is/WyOpl#selection-2525.0-2528.0) with the FRBNY, where, in addition to the right to borrow exorbitant sums of money at bargain level interest rates that practically nobody else has access to, the mega-bank also gets to act as the second largest shareholder of its respective district bank, giving the bank direct influence over who sits on the board of its federal reserve branch, which in the case of JPM, is the FRBNY, the largest CB branch in America, representing 55% of all CB banking assets in the country! [Read more](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/jpmorgan-chase-jpm-earnings-q2-2020.html)\n\nBut here’s an even better question, one that most people are probably secretly wondering to themselves, but few usually care enough ask..\n\n**Is this even fair?**\n\nTechnically those profits were the direct result of unprecedented central bank stimulus programs, so why should JPM’s shareholders be allowed to collect such massive [government subsidized profit](https://archive.is/Z1DJ5) without being obligated to give any of this money back? $14 billion is a huge sum of money to be making while the rest of the world suffers. Shouldn’t there be some kind of cap, or limit put into place for situations just like this? It’s not they’re doing anything spectacular with these [government subsidized profits](https://archive.is/Z1DJ5) anyways, evidenced in a recent report from Bloomberg which showed that starting in 2017, the 4 largest banks returned $1.26 to shareholders over a period of 3 years for[ every $1.00 that they earned in net income](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:TxjTpxsT5BQJ:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-24/bank-dividends-in-peril-with-crisis-veterans-warning-of-trouble+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us) — either in the form of share buybacks or dividends.\n\nThe federal reserve act requires that excess profits earned through the collection of interest on loans are to be returned back to the federal government, so maybe it’s time that we start applying a similar approach to these mega-banks, and finally begin forcing these TBTF financial institutions to share some of these monstrous profits with the general public.\n\nIs that really so much to ask at this point?\n\nOn top of all of this, lawsuits have even revealed that in addition to being granted the right to collect such mind-boggling [government subsidized profits](https://archive.is/Z1DJ5) without having to give any of this money back, these massive corporations are also working together behind closed doors under the guise of front organizations for the purpose of conspiring to block competition. Yes, they will even go so far as to band together to block companies from accessing key financial services — the very same financial services that are technically only available through them..\n\nYes, so even if you do — somehow, someway — manage to get your foot in the door at this exclusive, secret club, apparently it doesn’t even matter what you have to offer sometimes, because they may just wake up on the wrong side of the bed one day and just decide to block you anyways!!\n\nGo figure!\n\nBut of course, if it ever comes to the point where one of these massive, [gov subsidized](https://archive.is/Z1DJ5) multi-national banking organizations believes that it is more profitable to simply rip you off rather than do their jobs and take actual risk, have fun trying to sue them for the damages. Just ask [$COOP](https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=52473279) investors how long they’ve been waiting on their settlement. Or better yet, the teams of [high powered lawyers that allegedly meet in secret](https://archive.is/mpjf3) on an annualized basis to devise schemes so they can combat all of the pissed off companies and people that are constantly filing lawsuits against them!\n\nYes, they get together in secret — their lawyers — so you can rest assured that the chances of you being treated fairly are most likely slim to none, especially if you happen to be unfortunate enough to be one of their customers, because if that’s the case, then expect to be automatically [stripped of the right to a fair trial](https://archive.is/dMijU#selection-2729.0-2770.0), forced into mandatory arbitration, and assessed by FINRA — the self-regulator that they [openly admit to owning](https://archive.vn/j7kZs#selection-907.3-907.84) and controlling.\n\nYou can’t make this stuff up!!\n\nOne could even go so far as to argue that it is these very relationships that are providing the foundation for the alarming gap between [the rich and the poor in the United States](https://inequality.org/facts/global-inequality/#us-wealth-concentration). If a small handful of entrenched financial institutions can just simply, at the wave of a wand, subsidize their margins, and their losses, at what point do they cease to be simply ‘private corporations’, and more like extensions of government.",

      "selftext": "On Tuesday, Apple is holding a launch event where it will reveal this year’s iPhone lineup.\n\nIn most years, Apple announces its iPhones in September, and they go on sale shortly after that. This year is different. Apple instead released new Apple Watches last month and pushed the iPhone announcement to October. The delay is an outgrowth of the Covid-19 pandemic, which disrupted electronics manufacturing and forced most Apple employees to work from home. \n\nStill, this year’s iPhone launch is significant. It is expected to include the first major exterior redesign since 2017, when Apple released the iPhone X with facial recognition. This year’s models will feature iPad-like edges with flatter sides, compared with the gently curving sides of the current iPhones. \n\nApple is also expected to release four separate iPhones at different screen sizes and prices -- a much wider range of devices than in the past.\n\nFinally, at least some new iPhones will support 5G cellular networks, which promise faster download times (although the networks aren’t fully built out yet in the U.S., which could disappoint some users.)\n\nThe last time Apple made such big changes to the iPhone was 2014, when the iPhone 6 came out with bigger screens and two different sizes. That prompted a major upgrade cycle -- a so-called “super-cycle” -- with over 231 million iPhones sold in the next four quarters. That remained the annual unit sales record until Apple stopped reporting unit sales in 2018. \n\nSo this year’s changes have investors and analysts predicting a big upgrade cycle that will make Apple an even more valuable company.\n\n“We expect this fall’s launch to be the most significant iPhone event in years,” Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty wrote in a note this week. She’s forecasting Apple to ship about 220 million iPhones in its fiscal 2021, which would be up 22% year-over-year according to the Morgan Stanley model.\n\nFour models would be a dramatic expansion of its lineup, with both a new smaller option and a larger high-end option, giving consumers more choices and potentially spurring people to upgrade.\n\nThe phones are expected to be visually different from past years’ models, giving users another reason to upgrade.\n\n“These 4 new models will accompany the 2nd generation iPhone SE launched in spring 2020 to comprise Apple’s most complete lineup of new iPhones ever,” Huberty wrote. \n\nDifferent kinds of 5G\n\nApple’s tagline for the event is “Hi Speed,” a reference to the faster cellular speeds promised by 5G phones.\n\nInvestors and analysts have hoped for years that a 5G iPhone would represent a major upgrade and spur a big wave of sales not only for phone makers like Apple, but also for chip-makers like Qualcomm and carriers like Verizon and T-Mobile, which have bet big on 5G.\n\nThe biggest jump in speeds will come from the variety of 5G sometimes called millimeter wave or ultrawide band. But in the United States, millimeter wave is only available in certain markets and has limitations about how far it can be transmitted. While carriers are expanding quickly, the new iPhones may only be able to reach their full potential in a handful of regions. \n\nApple CFO Luca Maestri said this summer that it expected iPhones to go on sale a “few weeks later” than the traditional September launch schedule.\n\nIt’s possible that some models will go on sale shortly after the event while others take a longer time to hit store shelves, most likely due to challenges designing and manufacturing ten of millions of devices during a global pandemic. Last year, ten days elapsed between the launch event and the first iPhones that went on sale.\n\n“It remains somewhat speculative when exactly iPhones will be available for sale after this event as Apple typically announces the first day of sale during the event,” Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong wrote in a note this past week.\n\nTiming matters for investors because Apple’s first fiscal quarter has already started, kicking off on September 27. In past years, some new iPhone models have been on sale for the entire period, but this year that won’t be possible. \n\nThe number of weeks in the quarter that the new iPhones are on sale could affect Apple’s performance in the critical holiday quarter, as people around the world buy iPhones and other products as holiday gifts.\n\niPhone timing can also suggest which models might be in short supply, which investors watch closely to try and predict average selling prices for the quarter, which affects revenue.\n\nApple said earlier this year that Mac computers with chips it designed would start to ship before the end of the year. Current Mac computers use Intel chips. But those computers are likely not going to be discussed on Tuesday, according to a report from Bloomberg. Instead, Apple could save that product for a November launch event, which would be Apple’s third of the fall.\n\nIn past years, Apple has only held one or two fall launch events. But this year’s launches are different — they’re prerecorded and held virtually due to the pandemic. There is also continuing appetite for Apple launches from customers, media, and fans. Nearly 1.5 million people tuned in to a YouTube livestream last month to watch Apple executives announce new Apple Watches. \n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/11/apple-event-tuesday-the-most-significant-iphone-event-in-years.html)",

      "selftext": "Hello Reddit. Btw I will be copying this post into both r/stocks annd r/etfs just to try and get a broader range and opinions and hopefully more responses.\n\nI am 19, from the UK, debt free, no kids, still living with parents (cheap rent) and currently have an ISA with Freetrade with £5k invested so far since the 21st of September. My goal is to one day, as early as possible, quit my job to live off passive income and invest further to become even more rich (isn't this everyone's goal?). I am employed and aim to invest at least £1000 per month for the next 10+ years. Money I put in I don't ever plan on taking out.\n\nI am not new to Reddit however and am used to seeing people getting crucified for their lack of knowledge and/or their obliviousness about topics so once I show you my portfolio and ask a couple questions I am ready for the wrath of experienced investors saying what I am doing wrong. That is what I'm here for.\n\n$KO - 14% - 18.3 shares\n\n$T - 12.6% - 28.4 shares\n\n$XOM - 10% - 18.1 shares\n\n£GBDV - 7.7% - 19 shares\n\n£UKDV - 7.8% - 40 shares\n\n£VHYL - 7.5% - 10 shares\n\n$FSLY - 6% - 3.35 shares\n\n$AAPL  - 4.4% - 2.5 shares\n\n$UPWK - 4% - 13.4 shares\n\n£INRG - 4% - 22 shares\n\n£SGLN - 3.7% - 5 shares\n\n£BP - 2.9% - 52 shares\n\n£RDSA - 2.5% - 9 shares\n\n£ITV - 0.8% - 68 shares\n\nCash - 10%\n\nI know I need to change my portfolio drastically although I am a believer of buy and hold. I want 60% - 70% in a medium to low risk 'sub-section' of my portfolio purely invested in globally diversified ETFs across most/all sectors. \n\nThe remaining 30% I want to pick my own stocks for the mid/short term and see if I can make a relatively quick profit from market volatility. Again only to reinvest those profits, not to withdraw.\n\nI've seen a few videos/discussions/threads screaming 'Dividends do not matter and you shouldn't focus on them', but because as my goal is to live of passive income and I am starting so early in life, shouldn't they be what I should be trying to maximise to in order to benefit from reinvesting them and compounding?\n\nFinally, my last 2 queries I wanted to touch on are:\n\nFreetrade sucks. Took me about a week to realise its lack of features like a basic pie chart or automatic dividend reinvesting and limitations with so few types of stocks you can invest in. Whats the best platform for my goals as a UK investor? I've been thinking about Interactive Investor. Thoughts?\n\nAnd that leads to my last interest, real estate, or more specifically, REITs. I haven't done much research yet but I know i need a  different investing platform to buy them. How much of my total portfolio would be appropriate to put into REITs in the right sector and is now a good time?\n\nIf you've made it this far thank you for reading, if you have any questions for me please ask especially if I have left out any info/stats you would like to know!\n\nI'm not asking for in depth financial advice, just a discussion about smart decisions for the future! Thanks again",

I know everyone gonna say now invest in blue chip companies but is there anything like “SE ltd” or any new companies that are kinda gonna do well?

The drugmaker thinks there's a really good chance that it and **BioNTech** will announce preliminary results from a late-stage study of coronavirus vaccine candidate BNT162b2 [by the end of October](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/14/pfizer-says-it-could-know-if-its-covid-19-vaccine/).\n\nExpect Pfizer and BioNTech to quickly file for FDA emergency use authorization of BNT162b2 if the late-stage study results are positive. If the vaccine candidate wins EUA, the two companies stand to receive $1.95 billion to supply 100 million doses to the U.S. government. This supply agreement also has an option for the U.S. to purchase up to 500 million additional doses.\n\nMore big news should also be on the way for Pfizer. The company thinks that its planned merger of Upjohn with **Mylan** will close before year-end. The deal will boost Pfizer's growth as Viatris -- the new entity created by the merger -- will take a basket of Pfizer's older drugs with declining sales.\n\nIncome-seeking investors will still have a lot to like with Pfizer after the transaction finalizes, though. The company will continue to offer an attractive dividend. Anyone who holds onto their shares in both Viatris and Pfizer will receive a combined dividend in line with Pfizer's current dividend, which yields over 4%.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/12/pfizer-and-biontech-coronavirus-vaccine-accepted-f/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/12/pfizer-and-biontech-coronavirus-vaccine-accepted-f/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlus that websites information. I dont know much about either company other than PFE has just sat around the same price for a really long time (due to its amount of shares i believe) and that BNT has gone up a LOT lately (3 weeks ago it was $63 now $88) \n\nCurious what people think on this info. If they do get the go ahead and win this \"race\" we all see happening, could be billions coming in. Is anyone buying these long term?",

      "selftext": "There's a seeking alpha article I think is good (not allowed to link on this sub) that makes some articles I make- they basically go through the holdings and debt and compare it to the market cap to figure out how discounted it is, the number they arrived at a few months ago was a 35% discount. The crown jewel of Softbank Group is obviously Alibaba, which they own about 22% of. Then they own a big chunk (just sold down to around 40% I believe) of Softbank Corp, a major Japanese telecom company, and a chunk of TMobil.\n\nThat article is a little old and there has been some stuff sold, I also think they're a little pessimistic on some of the valuations of some of the privately held stuff. Softbank Group themselves estimates the value per share (of the shares traded in Tokyo) are 12,973 yen per share, currently traded at 6,521 yen, so just about half what the underlying value is. The truth of the privately-held valuations is probably somewhere inbetween the two estimates, but you can go line by line and evaluate for yourselves.\n\nhttps://group.softbank/en/ir/stock/sotp\n\nObviously worth addressing is the conventional argument for why it's so low- which is that Masayoshi Son makes apparently insane decisions sometimes. Which I won't dispute but I think the stories that make the headlines have a disproportionate impact on the market cap relative to the actual exposure that the decisions have on shareholders.\n\nFor example the WeWork issues were really bad, but this was all in the Vision Fund which was only 30% or so funded by Softbank Group and the shareholders, the rest was Arab oil money with Softbank managing it. In Softbank's own shareholder value estimates the entire Vision Fund was 1,458 yen/share or 11%. But it seemed to me to cause a disproportionate drag on the stock price for months, and probably still is. \n\nThe other obvious example is when people found out that Softbank was doing massive derivatives trades the share price dropped and they lost 9 billion in market cap over 4 billion in trades. I guess it's higher risk that what most companies do with their extra cash but when you have 10s of billions of liquid assets you have to do something with it, buying stocks of desirable companies seems like a reasonable way to keep it liquid to me.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-06/softbank-s-4-billion-trading-gains-on-u-s-stock-option-bet-ft\n\nBut onto some other stuff that I like about the company. \n\nIf it goes through the Arm sale is solid and Softbank would get a roughly $21.5 billion stake in NVIDIA, which is a nice asset to sit on. A minor footnote that might turn out to be a bigger deal is that Softbank is keeping an IoT company Arm had acquired.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-13/nvidia-buys-softbank-s-arm-for-40-billion-in-biggest-chip-deal\n\nhttps://www.adexchanger.com/data-exchanges/softbank-owned-treasure-data-on-the-nascent-but-growing-opportunity-of-iot/\n\nA couple of other less talked about assets that I think are worth noting for their growth potential are Softbank's near-50% stake in Yahoo Japan, which is the most commonly used search engine in Japan (still the world's 3rd largest economy) and it's actually powered by google. Another is Paypay, competing to be the fintech app in Japan and currently has the highest marketshare. The other is that they own Boston Dynamics (as I understand outright), hard to say how near they are to producing significant revenue but they're still a world leader in robotics technology, it could just be a matter of time before they find the right partners and applications and it becomes huge.\n\nAs part of Vision Fund there are a number of high-growth companies that took a real hit due to coronavirus but with the cash to weather the storm I still think will turn out to be solid in a few years. Including Uber (15% stake), Oyo (hotels), Grab (SE asian \"superapp\" multiple partners) and Paytm (Indian fintech, 20%) among lots of others. I actually think the biggest danger with these is giving up too soon on companies that are in the process of capturing marketshare, and Softbank has a ton of cash for continuing.\n\nVision Fund 2 is starting up with all the cash from recent asset sales and seems focused on higher tech, smaller companies. Which I think is a good strategy considering there are no partners. Recently including Biofurmis (digital therapeutics), Shipbob (warehouse/shipping for vendors listing on multiple websites) and XtalPi (AI in medecine). And the guy that manages it just announced today that they're starting a special acquisitions company.\n\nFurthermore there's an activist investor hedgefund (Eliott Management) involved as a watchdog, pushing for share buybacks and oversight.\n\ntl;dr the fuckups are sort of priced in and there's a lot to like.",

As in would I make more profit if I held and it continued to rise in price or would that be the same if I sold now and simply buy 20 shares again, if it continues to rise then I would still be profiting by the same amount, no? It's a bit confusing- I might have explained it poorly but let me know. Thanks.",

Consider placing a GTC Stop Loss Order at this price. \nUpside Target:  Let your winners run.  We have a price target of $211.52 for DDOG.  \n\nThat's almost 7:1 Risk/Reward\n\nDatadog operates a Service as a Software (SaaS) platform that integrates and automates infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, log management, and security monitoring to provide unified, real-time observability of their customers’ entire technology stack.\n\nNow in English: Tons of companies host their data across a wide range of servers, cloud services, apps, and software services. Monitoring all the data simultaneously can be a pain, so Datadog’s platform pulls all the fragmented data into a single dashboard. \n\nThey generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to customers using their cloud-based platform. Datadog employs a “land and expand” business model that focuses on offering products that are easy to adopt and have a short time to value. Their customer’s can expand their footprint with Datadog and often significantly increase their usage to other products on the platform. As of June 30th, 68% of their customers were using more than one product, up from 40% a year earlier. Additionally, as of June 20th, Datadog had 1,015 customers with annual subscriptions costing more than $100,000, up from 594 customers the previous year. \n\nLast week, Datadog’s stock hit an all-time high after the company announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft. Microsoft will integrate Datadog’s dashboard in its cloud platform Azure as a “first-class service”. This means companies can set up Datagod automatically on Azure instead of manually migrating their data. \n\nAnother reason to like Datadog in the mid-to-long-term is their push to expand internationally. Currently, only 24% of their revenue comes from outside North America. They’ve made and plan to continue making significant investments to expand geographically, particularly in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (basically the whole world except Latin America). They now have sales offices in Dublin, London, Amsterdam, Paris, Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo. This push may temporarily mute their operating results in the nearterm, but will drive performance over the next several years. \n\nTo top it all off, Datadog just became profitable. In the first half of 2020, its revenue rose 77% year-over-year to $271.3 million and they booked net income of $6.8 million, compared to a loss of $13.4 million a year earlier.\n\nCurrently, market research firm Gartner estimates the addressable business opportunity in IT operations to be $37 billion. Based on Datadog’s 2019 revenue they currently account for less than 1% of this market and have significant room to grow over the coming decade. \n\nWe think this is a special company with huge upside potential.  We definently want a piece of Datadog's future. \n\nFor more detail and picks, check out the Beastly newsletter from Richby36.com",

I know i cant just ask, why did it fall, cause if you could answer that then you would be stinking rich.

The House of Mouse will measure its success by the performance of streaming services, such as Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu, and the upcoming Star platform for international audiences.\n\nRoku stands to benefit every time a major studio leans further into the streaming-media sector, and Disney's commitment is about as big as it gets. This company is a leader in the emerging field of helping consumers access digital media, and you'll find its technologies baked into smart TV sets from many major consumer electronics manufacturers. Pouring more content from high-quality studios into this fast-growing market can only boost consumer interest in Roku's technology. Roku's shares have now gained 66% in 2020 and quadrupled from the 52-week lows of March. The stock was a no-brainer buy six months ago, and it's still a great high-growth investment today.",

I decided to do some performance analysis of these picks.\n\nIn 2012, a financial [article](https://moneymorning.com/2012/12/31/the-best-and-worst-stocks-of-2012/) wrote that these were the 5 \"Best\" stock picks of the year:\n\n**PulteGroup Inc (PHM)** \\- It's had some volatility but overall has grown by about 280% in 8 years\n\n**Sprint (S)** \\- Pulling data is hard but it appears that Sprint was pretty volatile but overall had a nice run, then a decline, until it was bought at 380% of its 2012 price\n\n**Whirlpool Corp (WHR)** \\- It had some volatile growth but is currently sitting at 199% of its 2012 price\n\n**Expedia (EXPE)** \\- It had a nice period of a lot of growth but COVID hit it hard. It's now sitting at 159% of its 2012 price\n\n**Bank of America (BAC)** \\- It grew quite a bit for a while but it hasn't fully recovered from COVID yet. It's currently 235% of its 2012 price\n\n**If you had invested $1k in the 5 \"Best\" stocks of 2012  at an even distribution (and HELD), you would now be sitting on about $2500, or over 250% growth.** \n\nNow let's see what the \"Worst\" stocks of 2012 were:\n\n**Radioshack (RSH)** \\- Sold in 2015 at effectively 0% of 2012 value\n\n**SUPERVALU Inc (SVU)** \\- Immediately experienced a 3 year 500% run-up, fell, then was sold in 2018 at 162% of 2012 value\n\n**Apollo Group (APOL)** \\- Sold in 2015 at 50% of 2012 value\n\n**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)** \\- It took a few years but eventually had a run-up over 3500%\n\n**Best Buy Inc (BBY)** \\- Almost immediately after the author hit send, this stock had an eight year run-up. It is now 1000% the value it was in 2012\n\n**If you had invested $1k in the 5 \"Worst\" stocks of 2012  at an even distribution (and HELD), you would now be sitting on over $9000, or over 900% growth.** \n\nIf you had taken all that many and just bought VOO in 2012, you'd be sitting at about **245% growth.**\n\nOf course, AMD is the real diamond here. Without it, this outcome would look different. \n\n**But even if we remove AMD, the other 4 \"worst\" stocks would have seen 2400% growth.**  \n\n**What does this all mean?** \n\nI think it means you shouldn't *necessarily* overlook \"bad\" stocks. Of course, do your due diligence. And definitely don't invest all your eggs there. But conversely, don't ignore picks just because someone tells you to. It might be worthwhile to keep a few \"bad\" eggs in a small basket of your larger portfolio. You never know what will come roaring back in five to ten years.",

      "selftext": "Hi. I'm a high schooler (16), and I started investing in the stock market about 6 months ago. \n\nI recently gained great interest in VR stocks, and I believe it has a huge potential to become a much larger market than it currently is. I'm sure that millions of others also noticed this potential, but I haven't seen much discussion going up anywhere. \n\nWhy I think Virtual Reality would rise rapidly:\n\n1) Covid-19 has forced us to transition offline events to online ones- and during the process, we learned that online learning &amp; working environments are not horrible but perhaps even beneficial. Several companies (especially tech) reported an increase in productivity after moving into online working environments. \n\nMany employees and students will continue to learn from home even after the pandemic ends, which opens new VR opportunities. Facebook announced their Occulus Quest 2 VR headsets yesterday and their VR office software 'Infinite Office' a few weeks ago. VR usage in workplaces and school will skyrocket once the technology becomes more mature and cheaper. \n\n2) It's a new thing to sell for Apple and Samsung. Phones of yesteryear have no noticeable differences than phones of this year, and this has been a struggle for companies that rely on consumers buying $1000 devices every two years or so. \n\nCompanies like Apple desperately need a new 'platform' to sell- and I think VR will serve that role. All relevant tech companies have patents on VR technology, and there are rumors of Apple VR in 2021. \n\n[https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/)\n\n3) Entertainment. Not only video games, but concerts, art, museums, plays, and perhaps even travel. VR gaming is a hot topic, but I think VR can open new opportunities for other entertainment forms. Some museums have already uploaded the VR environments of their exhibitions. BTS recently held their online concert two days ago and had over 1 million viewers. I believe VR concerts may overtake offline ones in the next several years. \n\nBut one concern I have is that the tech market seems to be in a bubble right now. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like there are several large bubbles that, when burst, could bring the whole market down. \n\nI feel that VR's success is a proven fact at this point, but I'm worried that I would suffer large losses throughout the next years if the bubble were to burst. \n\nWhat do you think about VR &amp; do you have any suggestions about what I should do?\n\nAlso, do you have any advice for a student investor (books, tips, or anything..)\n\nThank you!",

      "selftext": "I’d like to preface this post by stating this is my first proper DD that I’ve publicly submitted. I’ve been a follower of r/stocks for nearly 4 years now, mostly lurking and absorbing information. This is my way of thanking this community for helping me begin my investment journey and helping me mature into financial adulthood. I also think it’s necessary for me to make this point because lately I’ve noticed a concern with new accounts attempting to pump HYLN, which isn’t my intention nor is it something that I approve of as it leads to volatility. I plan to hold HYLN long-term (at the very least until I can avoid short-term capital gains tax before I start accepting *some* of my gains). \nBefore I begin I want to emphasize that **this is not a pump stock, the short-sellers need to stop treating it as one.** If you invested in this stock during the merger then short of accepting your losses you are now a long-term investor (1-2 years). Consider it a lesson learned and perhaps one that will pay for itself. \n\nOnto the meat. \n\n# Explaining Hyliion \nhttps://www.hyliion.com/\n\nHyliion (pronounced Hi-Lee-On) stands for HYbrid-LIthium-IOn. They're a company located in Austin, TX and led by a young CEO by the name of Thomas Healy. They offer electrified powertrain conversion systems for Class 8 fleet semi-trucks, effectively converting a diesel or natural gas powered semi-truck into a hybrid by replacing the powerhouse of the rear-most rear-axle with a battery-powered axle (think “Toyota Prius” functionality but on a larger scale). \nThey're also preparing a roll-out of their fully electric semi-truck known as the Hypertruck ERX. Their products are designed to improve performance and lower cost of ownership while leveraging the already-existing alternative fuel infrastructure. \n\nPrior to their IPO, Hyliion underwent the S P A C (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) merger process with Tort oise Acqui sition (S/H/L/L) company (I had to split the name of the acquisition company due to Rule 7). When anyone tells you that they got into Hyliion at sub-IPO prices it’s because they invested in the acquisition company S/H/L/L prior to HYLN’s merger, ticker change and subsequent IPO on the exchange. The ticker S/H/L/L was censored on r/stocks so many of you might not have heard of it prior to merger. I cannot speak to why it was censored but I felt it's important to clear up this confusion. \n\nS/H/L/L was reportedly reviewing at least a couple hundred companies to merge with and had their vision set on several renewable energy companies and eventually decided on Hyliion. The S P A C IPO process comes with its own regulations that can add complexity to the listing, however during an interview Thomas Healy stated that if the opportunity were to present itself again, he would still take the S P A C route to IPO. The hype factor appears to have helped potential clients pursue their company with interest instead of their company chasing clients, I see this as a huge win for them, as does Thomas Healy (1). \n\nThis hype factor, for better or worse, found its way into the retail investor’s strategy as well. The stock price climbed 500% within a few months. Despite being due for a correction many gambled on the hypothesis that the price would continue to rise after the merger. Unfortunately, the week prior and during the merger resulted in a lot of unplanned activity leading to an increase in volatility. During the merger there were eight proposals that Hyliion was pushing to be approved prior to completing the merger and being listed on the stock exchange. All passed but one; Proposal 3. Proposal 3 was set to classify the board of directors, however this proposal failed to pass by popular vote of the investors for the general reason summarized by one large investor below: \n\n&gt;One large investor, Kevin Jenkins of Utah Advisors, said his firm voted against proposal three in order to balance power between stockholders and the board. A classified board can make it harder for stockholders to force changes on a company when things go wrong. Jenkins cited recent troubles at Nikola as a recent example of such conflicts. (2)\n\n\nThis immediately resulted in the initial downward trend of the stock’s price. There was a lot of uncertainty in the air surrounding the merger and the future of the company (false rumors stating that “the merger cannot pass without this proposal” surfaced leading to more fear for the new-term future) and caused doubt for many retail investors. Hyliion extended the voting exclusively for Proposal 3 by an additional two days to recount and offer additional time to vote for those who didn’t. Proposal 3 failed again and once again the price of the stock dropped. The key to what happened on Wednesday however is that Hyliion confirmed that the merger would still be taking place on that Friday, and the ticker would change from S/H/L/L to HYLN at some point in the following week for all brokerages (the timing varies between them). This all seemed to line up once again until the unexpected happened at the worst time, the Thursday evening prior to the ticker change President Trump confirmed via Twitter that he tested positive for CoVid-19. The markets tanked and Hyliion was hit about as hard as you could imagine. \n\nEventually, the merger went through and now we can move onto talking about what this company offers for the future of the Class 8 semi-truck industry!  \n\n\n#**Product 1:** The Hybrid-Electric Product\nThe hybrid conversion products are available for order and fitting TODAY and can be optioned to cost between $36,000 and $40,000 per unit (7). It's a product that's universally compatible between all trucking OEMs (it's already been featured mounted to a 2020 Freightliner Cascadia in front of the NYSE and Thomas Healy has confirmed that it can be installed on all other CLASS 8 manufacturers as well including Peterbilt, Volvo, Mack, Kenworth and International). \n\nThe front most rear axle is still driven by the truck's factory engine, however the rear most rear axle is 100% electric-drive. A keynote is that this product is not manufactured in house, it’s manufactured by DANA; an industry leading supplier of drivetrain, axle and electrified propulsion components. DANA holds a stake in HYLN equity (12). \n\nTwo options for the hybrid conversion unit exist. They can be installed on both a used truck as well as a brand-new truck while retaining the manufacturer’s warranty. I’ll briefly cover them both below:\n\n**The Hybrid Diesel Unit**\nEssentially taking your typical diesel-powered semi-trucks and fitting them with a battery-powered rear most rear axle. The battery system can be installed on nearly every OEM’s Class 8 semi-truck with no additional driver training required. The unit weighs 695lbs and adds ~1500 ft lbs. of torque and 120hp capability to the semi-truck, offering immediately improved performance and efficiency. The software (created in-house) offers advanced analytics that maximize fuel economy by determining precisely when to utilize the captured energy, keeping the truck in an efficient operating range (4) with assistance through the power of regenerative braking that supplements the jake brake (a generally prohibited noisy brake that brakes the engine by loss of energy that would otherwise be used to turn the engine’s crankshaft) and reduces the truck’s brake wear thereby reducing maintenance on this component of the vehicle as an additional bonus. \n\nDuring a vlog test-drive with the hardware (7), two truckers summarized their opinion on the hybrid conversion system using the following points:\n\n* It “feels and runs just like a regular diesel truck”. \n* Saves on fuel. \n\n* The increased performance is very welcomed, especially during up-hill driving.\n\n* The software offers a “points system” that keeps track of the driving habits of the driver, keeping them conscious of their driving decisions and helping them save money through efficiency. \n\n\n**The Hybrid Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Unit**\nThis hardware is identical to the hardware utilized for the hybrid-diesel unit. CNG trucks are generally underpowered when compared to their diesel counterparts, this product assists the CNG trucks in gaining performance by storing energy on down hill roads and flat terrains to assist in accelerating the truck up the next inclined road. The additional power figures help supplement additional payload as well, allowing for tandem sets to be pulled by CNG trucks (a trait generally exclusive to diesel-powered trucks). Again, the beauty of this product shines from the software that uses algorithms designed to take advantage of previously collected hill data based on terrain and location to maximize climbing power (5). \n\nA common retort I’ve seen by the investing community is that “hybrids aren’t the future, electric is”. I agree, however I also believe that the hybrid solution is the short-term, necessary steppingstone to the electric future. Hyliion has a plan for the future as well. Let's move onto that. \n\n\n#**Product 2:** The Hypertruck ERX\nEnter the ERX. This is their fully electric-drive truck. The rear axle is driven solely by an electric motor with battery cells provided by Toshiba and packaged and managed in-house by Hyliion (8). When the truck’s battery power is low an under-the-hood generator turns on, converting renewable natural gas produced by biowaste to charge the battery thus delaying the need for a grid-charge. This results in the Hypertruck ERX producing NET-NEGATIVE CARBON EMISSIONS. \n\nPage 9 of their investor presentation offers the following comparison between their Hypertruck ERX, Tesla’s Battery-Electric Vehicle (BEV) and Nikola’s scam product:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/v59n7lQ.png \n\nThe truck offers 1,300 miles of range with a larger payload than the competition and shorter recharging time than a Tesla:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KKv4tzb.png \n\n#**Product 3:** The Batteries &amp; Software\nThe battery packaging, modules and management systems (software controlling the functionality of the battery) are built in-house by Hyliion. The lithium-ion battery cells are sourced from Toshiba. \n\nHyliion’s software is a key product that appears to be overlooked by many investors. The software works off of driving habits and locations to allow for a more efficient battery life, prolonging drivability between refuels as well as increased efficiency and the pat on the back  knowing that you're utilizing renewable resources.  Thomas Healy has stated that one of their company’s goals is to work with the battery cells that are provided to them and configure the functionality of the batteries with their software to outlast the truck's lifespan; instead of evolving the batteries they are evolving the software that can make the current-existing technology *better*.\n\n#Clients\nBelow is a list of target customers. Do with this information what you will as most of them have not been confirmed at this time but being focused on such heavy hitters provides a very positive outlook for the investors:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/UxSQ3Ra.png \n\n* The logistics company “Agility” has confirmed a pre-order of 1,000 Hypertruck ERX vehicles (featuring a $5,000 deposit per truck). The initial fleet demonstration vehicles are expected to be delivered at some point in 2021, with volume shipments scheduled for 2022 for all clients. Agility also invested in HYLN pre-merger.\n\n* Wegmans, a grocer that offers 103 stores and two distribution centers across seven states, has paired with Hyliion for their CNG conversion product. They recently purchased two brand new Volvo CNG semi-trucks, one that is being used to test the Hyliion CNG conversion system. Wegmans' statement on this product is quoted as “a true performance game changer that gives the truck enough torque and horsepower to pull a tandem set” (13). Prior to Hyliion’s conversion system the only trucks they had that could pull a tandem set were diesel-powered. Wegmans has a history of pushing for renewables. Their assuring stance on Hyliion’s product bodes well for  Hyliion’s company, investors and their future clients. \n\n* Saving the dessert for last. This is not a confirmed client, but this was a very interesting find to come across. In the beginning of this video, showing off the ERX:\n(SOURCE WAS YOUTUBE - REMOVED - I didn't realize I can't use YouTube links in my posts, instead please reference the screenshots below - if you're interested feel free to PM me for the actual link to the video). \nIf you look closely, you’ll see what appears to be an H-E-B (a supermarket grocery chain based in San Antonio Texas) semi-truck:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/QoQtxHx.png\nHere’s an image I pulled from the internet that shows what their semi-truck looks like in full:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/2RUknKA.png \nThis may only be the beginning of the rumor, but it seems likely that HEB is testing Hyliion’s conversion product. After all, they are on Hyliion’s “Target Customers” list featured in the image at the beginning of this section. \n\n\n#Competition\nI should begin this segment by stating that at this moment Hyliion does NOT have any competition when it comes to hybrid conversion technology for Class 8 semi-trucks. \n\n**Tesla** \n\nTesla has plans to build battery-powered semi-trucks at the cost of ~$200,000 per truck, with an expected range of 500 miles (compared to Hyliion’s 1300 miles with the ERX). I think that they are a very competent competitor however they have many fine lines left to iron out and like Hyliion, the strength of their position in this sector is still completely unknown. They’re dominating the retail consumer EV market but that can’t be compared to the truck market. I also don’t believe that autonomous trucking will become the norm any time soon (lobbyists and lawsuits will push this back for years if not decades). An advantage for Hyliion here is timing; they're ahead of the game with their products already available for testing, analytics and purchase.\n\nThroughout my DD I’ve found myself reading trucking blogs and watching trucking vlogs. I’ve noticed that truck drivers tend to be “old school” and particular people. I can’t imagine that the interior minimalistic qualities that Tesla is known for will be popular with those clients (chains like WalMart won’t care what their truckers like or dislike which renders this point moot in that sense, however the many smaller chains and retail drivers will consider this point in their decision). \n\n**Nikola Motors**\n\nThey’re under investigation by the SEC amid fraud allegations, and the CEO Trevor Milton has since stepped down from his position within the company. Not only that but GM have pushed back their contract to renegotiate their terms given the company’s recent headlines in the news. At this moment I don't think it's reasonable to consider their company a competitor to anyone.\n\n#Concerns\n\nI can’t trust someone’s DD unless if it contains some potential negatives about the company, so I couldn’t expect you to read through mine without knowing what concerns I have about Hyliion's future:\n\n* They’re a newly offered company that’s only a few years old with a young, unproven albeit ambitious and driven CEO. How will he handle the title of \"youngest billionaire\"? How will he handle potentially delayed earnings in the future? Will he reallocate funds properly in his company? How does he interview his potential peers and under what basis does he hire on?\n\n* Their revenue won't ramp up for at least a year. They’re expecting $1,000,000 in revenue by the end of 2020, and $8,000,000 by 2021. The expected earnings increase at an ambitious rate and right now we don’t know how competently the company will be run in the long term. Their expected earnings from 2020-2024 can be seen here: https://i.imgur.com/QC1F5Pj.png \n\n* Their social media presence isn't up to par with what the investors were expecting. Thomas Healy has promised to be more active on social media, but people want more. He went from never posting anything to posting once every couple of weeks. People are expecting a Trevor Milton tier of pumping which they won't receive, but I think it'd be nice to hear from him a bit more often so that we know he's still alive, at least. Obtaining a closer relationship with your investors is never a bad idea either. I noticed that Hyliion is looking for a VP of Marketing at this moment, perhaps that person will assist here. \n\nIf you made it this far I commend you and appreciate your time. We’re here to become better traders and if you have any critiques or corrections regarding my DD I’m happy to acknowledge them. \n\n**NOTE:** Some of my sources were removed. I didn't realize that YouTube links cannot be referenced in posts. I understand the reasoning (people will pump their own channels), but it's an inconvenience here. If anyone wants the direct links I am happy to PM them to you.\n\nSources:\n\n1.)\tREMOVED\n\n2.)\thttps://theheadlinereporter.com/tort oise-approves-hyliion-deal/\n\n3.)\thttps://www.hyliion.com/hybrid-diesel/ \n\n4.)\thttps://www.hyliion.com/technology/ \n\n5.)\thttps://www.hyliion.com/hybrid-cng/ \n\n6.)\tREMOVED\n\n7.)\tREMOVED\n\n8.)\tREMOVED\n\n9.)\thttps://www.tesla.com/semi \n\n10.)\thttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759631/000121390020015311/ea123187ex99-3_tort oiseacq.htm\n\n11.)\thttps://www.hyliion.com/hyliion-launches-fully-electric-powertrain-announces-1000-truck-pre-order-with-global-logistics-leader-agility/  \n\n12.)\t https://www.fleetowner.com/running-green/article/21703564/dana-takes-stake-in-hyliion-in-another-boost-for-electrification \n\n13.)\thttps://www.wegmans.com/news-media/articles/partnership-with-hyliion-american-natural-gas/",

Any one do this before? If so, how do you determine exact selling windows in newer industries? Part of me thinks that I should just avoid this type of ETF since there will be big winners and big losers (given market demand but only so much room for top-levels since it is a sub-sector). Did anyone just do a fundamental look at individual companies and choose from them yourself instead for newer, high growth sectors?

Banks have made hundreds of millions of dollars in gains on STAR stocks since the market launched in July 2019. \n\nIn a measure meant to ensure underwriters brought good deals to market at fair prices, authorities required the most senior institutions on any deal on Shanghai’s Science and Technology Innovation Board, also known as the STAR market (think of it as China's NASDAQ), to take part themselves. These banks, known as sponsors, must buy between 2% and 5% of the shares sold, up to a maximum of about $147 million, and then hold the stock for at least two years.\n\nTo date, sponsors have invested nearly 3.5 billion yuan, the equivalent of about $519 million, in the STAR market’s 20 biggest initial public offerings and secondary listings, Wall Street Journal calculations show. As of Tuesday’s close, those holdings had doubled in value to more than $1 billion.  \n\nChinese and foreign banks were wary of the risks this posed, not least because the country’s markets have experienced a series of booms and busts over the last decade and a half.\n\nThe overall totals will be much higher, since more than 180 companies are now listed on the STAR market, according to Shanghai Stock Exchange data.",

Does this mean I can execute day trades with no limit now? How does that ultimately affect unsettled cash?\n\nFor example, I have exactly $25,000(additional $25000 on margin due to a 2:1 margin ratio). I buy stocks worth $25000 today. I sell all shares the same day for an extra $500, bringing my balance to $25,500. Can I right away put in another $25,500 in stocks to then sell again for another $500 profit all in the same day without penalty? In the example here, would I be buying on margin at all if I hold overnight?\n\nI appreciate any insight/help!",

Smead projected that markets could be in for a nosedive since despite its monetary policy shoring up credit markets, the Federal Reserve \"can't save a stock market.\"\n\n\"They are buying bullish call options that expire inside two weeks. There was ($500 billion) of bullish call options bought in a four-week stretch by small retail traders,\" Smead said.\n\nA call option is a contract between the buyer and seller of the call to exchange a security, in this case a stock, at an agreed price.\n\n\"In '99 it was $100 billion, in '07, it was $100 billion. That is what young, dumb investors are doing and when the market makers see those (call buying) out there, they sell that call to that person and they buy the stock,\" Smead added.\n\nHe suggested that the willingness of wealthy investors and the baby boomer generation to \"ride the index to a fault\" and overpay for stalwart American businesses such as Costco and Microsoft was also detrimental.\n\n\"Microsoft is a wonderful company, but at 40 times earnings, there is a 0% chance of that producing wealth for someone over the next 10 years that will meet their needs.\"\n\nDespite a sharp tech sell-off in early September, Microsoft shares remain 40% higher since the turn of the year, while fellow tech titans Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix have all been on a tear since March's crash.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/smead-nightmare-us-stock-valuations-driven-by-young-dumb-investors.html)",

In June, however, the gap between Tesla and Nio was wider, at 12,478, with 14,954 Model 3s sold and 2,476 ES6s delivered.\n\n“Strong sales over the past three months have cemented a belief among China’s home-grown new energy vehicle companies that Tesla is not unbeatable,” said Gao Shen, a Shanghai-based independent analyst covering the manufacturing sector. “Chinese carmakers, although still lagging behind their US rival, can eventually catch up if they churn out proper and affordable products for domestic drivers.”",

      "selftext": "&gt;And yes, it really looks that bad  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You just have to look at the bank’s prices. Classic banking is a reflection of the real economy. And it’s getting worse and worse.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The lending business is paralyzed because companies and consumers are reluctant. Investments are being postponed and savings rates have risen all over the world, the people just take precautions. In the US, where the economy is primarily dependent on consumption, the buying mood is historically bad.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The granting of consumer credit has **collapsed**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The charts of JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup are all problematic. It goes without saying that things don’t look any better at Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For example, Bank of America’s stock has left the uptrend and threatens to tip over. Below $23 there would be a procyclical sell signal with possible price targets at $21 and $19. If the support doesn’t hold at $21 and $19, it could go much lower.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The DBK shares are firmly in the grip of the bears. Under €7.50 the way would be free up to €6.80. Below that, the chart continues to cloud over and there is a risk of a relapse to the **annual lows**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;A ticking time bomb  \nGovernments and central banks have thrown money around, but that will not save everyone.  \nIn Germany, the Government has even suspended the obligation to file for insolvency. That means companies don’t currently have to file for bankruptcy even if they are insolvent.  \nIt is absurd.  \nInitially, this was in effect until September 30th but was then extended to December 31st, and it is expected that it will not be the last extension.  \nBut that only postpones the problems and nobody knows what will happen afterward.  \nIs there a risk of bankruptcies?  \nProbably. And the longer you wait, **the worse it gets**.  \nIf the first companies overturn, there could be a domino effect. If company A files for bankruptcy, it also damages many business partners. If they stay seated on demands, they can also get into difficulties.  \n*In my opinion, we are dealing with a ticking time bomb…*\n\n*full article:* [here](https://cryptoeinfach.medium.com/coronavirus-second-wave-e409b9c3c6af)\n\nPure scare tactics or do we really have another crash in the Banking sector soon, what is your opinion?",

For example, I have a brother in law that is an executive at a major corporation, and other friends who work in finance positions at serious places. Obviously, if they sat down and told me some juicy piece of information that would impact their company price, that would obviously be illegal. What is the line though? If someone with access just suggests to someone they buy something on a certain day, but without giving any detail as to why, does that constitute something illegal for both people? \n\nI'm really just wondering, because it seems like this is something that would happen all the time.",

      "selftext": " \n\nAT&amp;T is a company that I'm sure doesn't need explaining. It is familiar to all of us as a telecom company that has branched out to providing internet, entertainment (HBO Max being one of their more recent ventures), and more.\n\n**Why this is being posted now &amp; the potential:**\n\n* Q3 reporting is set for 22 October.\n* At its current price AT&amp;T is in a position to provide significant growth prospects alongside a safe, high-paying dividend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at it current chart (16 October for reference) we can clearly see here that the stock is trading at its lowest levels since Q1. This provides a great opportunity to buy quality company at much higher yields to lock in superior long-term returns. It is unlikely they will drop much lower than this point due to the effect downward pressure has on dividend paying companies. If we look at the older charts, when AT&amp;T has reached these lows the stock has a strong tendency to rally from this 27-28$ support area. Additionally AT&amp;T has a lot going for it, let's quickly take a look.\n\n**What AT&amp;T has going for it:**\n\n* It has increased its dividend payout for the last 36 years and has the means to continue to do so.\n* Consistent revenue growth.\n* Lots and lots of cash on hand.\n* They are a leader in the US for 5G.\n* They are working to replace old top management (This is particularly important).\n* Warner Media and HBO Max\n\nWarner Media and HBO Max may be points of controversy here. Let's look at it from this perspective. These get AT&amp;T into new markets, HBO in particular into the saturated streaming market. Netflix has dominated this particular sector, however Disney and AT&amp;T are cracking Netflix's business model by pulling back their streaming to their own platforms. This is the reason Netflix is creating so many of its own shows/movies and increasing it's subscription price. This pressure is allowing AT&amp;T to slowly claw its way in. (Very slowly though, obv HBO Max is no Disney Plus). Additionally this will be the first full quarter of HBO Max on the books for AT&amp;T, with 36 million new subscribers reported it is likely to have a positive effect on the report.\n\nThe safe dividend is a strong factor to remain bullish on AT&amp;T. Even with the disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, AT&amp;T's balance sheets show recurring profitability and consistent cash flow generation can easily cover the quarterly payouts.\n\n**Two big issues:**\n\n* A lot of long-term debt (At extremely low rates, so fortunately it doesn't impact their cash flow)\n* Terrible acquisitions over the last 10 years (Direct TV, which they are looking to sell)\n\nIt could be a good sign that AT&amp;T is finally looking to sell the underperforming Direct TV. Sure they bought it for $67 Billion and would likely sell for $20 Billion but off loading legacy segments can allow them to focus on growth and expand into markets that are actually relevant for today and tomorrow while being less of a drag on their current debt.\n\n**Final Comments:**\n\nPlease extend my DD by doing your own research on top of everything else you have read here, there were many points only briefly touched on.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read!",

      "selftext": "After the close of trading on Wednesday, Vertex announced it would discontinue its Phase 2 study of protein-deficiency drug VX-814 and stop development because of safety concerns. After 28 days of testing the company put a stop to its “crown jewel” drug trials. To read more about what happened, read [here](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vtx-stock-tumbles-stops-testing-protein-deficiency-treatment/)\n\nVRTX shares gapped down 20% from $276 to $218 on Thursday morning. This could shape up for an excellent dip buying opportunity and here’s why I think so. \n\nLet’s take a look at Vertex’s fundamentals real quick. The biggest thing that stands out is the company has practically *no debt*. This is a huge factor especially in an economy full of corporate debt and high D/E ratios. This puts the company at a current ratio of 3.7, very strong. The company’s EPS has grown 28% over the last 5 years and is expected to continue that trend into the next 5 years, with an expected growth of 25%, giving it a PEG of 1.09. Again, in a market full of sky high valuations, this looks very attractive. It has 38% profit margins and high returns, with ROI being 14%, ROA 23% and ROE of 32%. This company has a *killer* balance sheet. \n\nHowever, with a gap down like that, it obviously has more to do with the sentiment towards the company itself and not the balance sheet. However, it seems like a major over correction. The VX-814 trials were still in very early phases so this setback has very little impact on the company financially. Vertex has a large portfolio of drugs and medicines, and the VX-814 was only one of them, although it was the most watched trial. This recent movement seems like a major overcorrection to a very fundamentally sound company.\n\nThere are some risks associated with this, however I believe the risks are market related and not company related. The company is strong but investor sentiment can continue to be bearish for the near future. However, if you have been eyeballing VRTX, I believe now is a good time to open a small position and keep eyes on the stock. If it continues to move down from here, keep averaging down until it finds a solid bottom. If $215-$220 is the bottom, continue buying at that price. \n\nI opened a small position in VRTX today after having it on my watch list for several weeks. I’m not directly associated with the company in any way other than being a shareholder.",

During market swings and volatility, they might move down in price, however, their business actually becomes more profitable!\n\nMy favourite example: German market maker “Lang &amp; Schwarz“ (which translates to “Long &amp; Black, hihihihi. Traded on most German exchanges under ticker LUS or ISIN DE0006459324). It is now the official and only MM for all stocks and ETFs (not for options though) traded on the German version of R0binhood (called Trade Republic) and other neo-brokers - they do all monthly ETF sales on Smartbroker for example. They only have a market cap of ~100m€ but are aiming to become a top 3 mm within the next years (competition like Tradegate has mcaps of ~1bn).\n\n\nSo basically in a market swing or downturn they become cheap to buy while their intrinsic business actuall becomes more valuable.\n\n\nI cannot say much about international market makers, as the few I looked into were tied to big banks and the core business overweighted their mm activity.

      "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 19th, 2020.\n\n# **More volatility is likely ahead as rising cases, lack of stimulus overshadow strong earnings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/more-volatility-is-likely-ahead-as-rising-cases-lack-of-stimulus-overshadow-strong-earnings.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Another volatile week may be in store for traders as coronavirus cases rise in the U.S. and Europe while Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over new fiscal aid.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 fell for three straight days this week. That slide was the longest losing streak for the averages since mid-September. The two market benchmarks eked out slight gains on Friday to snap their losing streak.\n*****\n&gt; Investors and traders expect this choppy trading action to continue, especially as the worsening coronavirus data and a lack of U.S. coronavirus stimulus draw attention away from a strong earnings season thus far.\n*****\n&gt; “The combination of no stimulus, fading economic momentum, and the threat of rising coronavirus cases, creates a rather negative dynamic for risk assets right now,” said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; The seven-day average of new daily coronavirus infections has risen in 39 states, including New York, New Jersey and Wisconsin, according to a CNBC analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University and the U.S. Census Bureau. At the nationwide level, the rate of new daily cases is at its highest level since August.\n*****\n&gt; In Europe, the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases has surpassed that of the U.S., leading several countries in the region to reinstate tougher social distancing rules and roll back previous reopening measures.\n*****\n&gt; “What this means is economic activity may slow down a bit, and we’ve already started to see some of that in the data,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, noting the weekly jobless claims numbers released Thursday show they’ve reached a point where “they’re not going to get better; they’re going to get worse.”\n*****\n&gt; The Labor Department said initial U.S. jobless claims hit their highest level since August, reaching 898,000 in the week ending Oct. 10.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also keep their eyes on Washington during the week ahead as lawmakers continue to struggle over new U.S. fiscal stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; # Political posturing on stimulus ‘hurting’ those in need\n&gt; This week, President Donald Trump said he would raise his offer for a coronavirus aid above the current level of $1.8 trillion. The White House’s current offer is smaller than a $2.2 trillion package passed by the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said the administration’s proposal “falls significantly short” of what is needed.\n*****\n&gt; This back and forth between the two parties has dwindled expectations among market participants of a compromise being reached before the Nov. 3 election. It has also added to the concerns surrounding the U.S. economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; “This political posturing is hurting that cohort of the economy that needs help the most,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “To the small and mid-size business owner, the airlines, this is not just about politics; this is every day life. There going to be an impact in the real economy if we don’t see something now.”\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings season ignored?\n&gt; Those talks over further stimulus are also expected to divert attention away from the corporate earnings season, which began this week but had next to no impact on the broader market.\n*****\n&gt; Procter &amp; Gamble, Netflix, Travelers, American Airlines and American Express are among the companies slated to report next week.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and VF Corp. are among the 49 S&amp;P 500 companies that posted their latest quarterly results this week. Of those 49 companies, 86% reported better-than-expected earnings, according to data from The Earnings Scout.\n*****\n&gt; “I wish I could say that next week we’re going to put aside the politics and the Covid concerns behind us, but we won’t trade this earnings season,” said Hogan of National Securities. “While it will likely be a record-breaking season for companies beating estimates, it’s also going to be one that is largely ignored because there’re so many other macro factors that are more important.”\n*****\n&gt; There is also some important housing data in the week ahead, including home builders’ sentiment Monday, housing starts Tuesday, and existing home sales Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; “The housing market is still off to the races,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The mortgage applications were strong, suggesting very strong activity in the month of September.”\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said the market will eventually cool when interest rates begin to rise. But for now, “certainly the economy could use the juice.”\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6i8E0Lr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zGJke6U.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/jkd6p4Z.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/sQiEyVc.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zksl2rH.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eBTMjg7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xUN9dhd.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Tu2aS7U.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ffP3FJL.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nGdIfrv.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/TrguDpO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4CSvumn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GN3ZIki.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts We Are Watching\n\n&gt; There are many charts that caught our attention this week, and today we share the top 5 charts we’re watching.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index recently had a four-week losing streak and fell nearly 10% along the way, while the Nasdaq and many large cap tech stocks fell even more. Then in a big move higher over the past two weeks, many stocks moved from oversold to overbought in a very quick timeframe.\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, more than 90% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 were beneath their 10-day moving average on September 24 and within two weeks saw more than 90% above this short-term trend line. This type of buying thrust is consistent with future strong returns, suggests quick reversals from oversold to overbought are a good thing, and could bode well for stocks to outperform bonds well into 2021.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Parts of the economy are opening back up, while employment continues to disappoint. One specific area that continues to improve is how many people are flying, as the seven-day average number of travelers going through Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints hit a new recovery high. We discuss other high-frequency data points in our COVID Surge Stalling Europe’s Recovery blog.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We’ve noted before that stock market gains ahead of the election historically support the incumbent party, while if stocks are lower it tends to support new leadership in the White House. Taking this further, the US dollar also tends to send signals for who might win. In fact, when stocks are up and the US dollar is lower ahead of the election, or if stocks are lower and the US dollar is higher before an election, the results have accurately predicted the last seven times those scenarios took place. Given stocks are up and the US dollar is slightly lower, this could be one clue the upcoming election will be much closer than many are expecting.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Sticking with the election, many investors are worried about higher taxes and more deregulation if former Vice President Joe Biden wins. “Higher taxes may be one part of it, but Biden is also looking at huge spending initiatives,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stock markets like spending, and this could more than help offset potentially higher taxes.” Lower tariffs could potentially provide another offset as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, Friday’s retail sales report came in better than expected, marking five consecutive months of year-over-year gains. It is worth noting the economy has never been in a recession after 4 or more consecutive monthly gains. Still, in the face of one of the most severe recessions ever, it took only a few months for sales to get back to new highs, as shown below. Historically, new highs in retail sales happen in expansions—and this is yet another clue the recession is likely over.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Record Surge In Business Formations As Economy Recovers From COVID\n\n&gt; Yesterday the Census updated business formation stats for Q3, and as indicated by high-frequency data from the Atlanta Fed, business formation exploded in Q3. As shown in the first chart below, total business applications rocketed upwards by 1.57 million, a record increase. Stripping out businesses that are unlikely to result in hiring, the numbers are much smaller in absolute terms but still rose 79% to a record pace. Finally, applications for businesses with planned wages surged 70% from a record low in Q2, to the highest levels since 2008.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101520-Biz-Apps.png))**\n\n&gt; In all three instances, the recent behavior is a complete reversal of the post-Financial Crisis period, when the prolonged recession led to a huge decline in business starts. That’s a good sign for the breadth of the economic rebound, as business formation tends to lead to higher productivity thanks to more innovation and investment. Below we show changes in total business applications by state; Michigan, Illinois, and Georgia are the biggest winners, with applications more than doubling. This analysis was originally published in our evening report -- The Closer -- on 10/14/20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101520-Biz-Apps-State.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Rebound\n\n&gt; After a disappointment last month, Retail Sales saw a nice rebound in September as consumers seem undeterred from spending despite the expiration of extended UI benefits and the lack of an additional stimulus bill. For the month of September, headline Retail Sales rose 1.9% m/m versus expectations for a more modest increase of 0.8%. Ex Autos and Gas, growth was even better relative to expectations, although August’s already slower than expected growth was revised modestly lower.\n\n&gt; Breadth in this month’s report was strong. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but one of them (Electronics and Appliances) showed growth. Normally, when a sector shows m/m growth of a percent or two, it’s impressive. This month, though, the volatility of the pandemic remains in place as two sectors showed growth of over 5%, including Clothing which saw double-digit growth relative to August!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/sectors1016.png))**\n\n&gt; While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # University of Michigan Mixed Again\n\n&gt; The University of Michigan reported preliminary consumer sentiment numbers for October. University of Michigan data has shown a much smaller bounce than other sentiment surveys, but the preliminary numbers for October did increase versus September. The strongest part of the survey was expectations, which has risen three months in a row to the highest levels since March. Consumers' current assessment of the economy fell sequentially and is sitting at about the same place it was back in early 2012.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101620-Michigan.png))**\n\n&gt; One feature of the University of Michigan poll with incomplete data prior to 2016 but more complete data since is a breakout of economic sentiment by political party affiliation. As shown below, their data shows Republicans getting a massive sentiment boost in the wake of the 2016 election. The key here though, is that the boost to the sentiment of Republicans and the decline for Democrats came after the election as this data is definitely lagging to political outcomes rather than leading.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101620-Michigan-Part.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Smiles\n\n&gt; Sentiment among small businesses continued to improve in the month of September according to the NFIB's monthly Small Business Optimism Index. As shown below, the index rose 3.8 points to 104 which is now just half of a point below the levels prior to the pandemic in February. That was also better than expectations of a smaller improvement to 101.2. Small business sentiment has now risen in four of the past five months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; In the table below, we break down this month's report by each of the ten components of the headline number as well as the many other indices included in the report such as those not used as inputs to the headline number and what small businesses are reporting to be their biggest problems.\n\n&gt; Across all indices of the September report, breadth was solid with only a couple of indices falling month over month—Expected Credit Conditions and Credit Conditions Availability. Some of those that were higher saw record or near-record month-over-month increases.\n\n&gt; Some of the most notable indices this month included those regarding inventories. The Current Inventories index which gauges the net percent of owners viewing current inventory levels as too low rose 2 points to a record high reading of 5. Given this, the index for Plans to Increase Inventories is tied with the reading from November of 2004 for a record high of 11. Indicating low inventory levels, the report is consistent with some other recent data like the regional Fed manufacturing surveys. Those low inventories are resulting in higher prices as that index's 12-point increase in September marked the biggest one month gain on record. While the Higher Prices index is not at any sort of an extreme, September's move indicates that a rising number of businesses are raising prices.\n\n&gt; Additionally, those higher prices and lower inventory numbers appear to be a result of demand that continues to rapidly improve. The indices for Actual Sales and Actual Earnings Changes remain negative for a sixth and tenth month in a row, respectively, meaning a net number of businesses continue to see lower rather than higher top and bottom-line numbers. But these indices are seeing big moves higher. For the index of Actual Earnings Changes, the 13-point climb in September was the largest on record and the 9-point increase for Actual Sales Changes followed a 13-point increase in August; both being some of the largest one-month moves on record. In order to meet the needs of this demand, a higher number of businesses plan to increase employment with that index rising to 28; the highest level since December of 2018. Even though businesses seek to hire more, they also report it is hard to fill positions as the index of Job Openings Hard to Fill rose to the top 5% of all readings. Cost and quality of labor also were reported as two of the most pressing problems for businesses.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Table2.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Businesses Cautiously Optimistic\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we highlighted the details of the September NFIB Small Business Optimism report. The report showed overall sentiment among small businesses has continued to improve as demand has bounced back (though it has not yet fully recovered as still more businesses report lower sales and earnings on a net basis) leading to low inventory levels, higher prices, and a need for more employment. While generally improved conditions have lifted optimism, that is not to say small businesses have given an all-clear. The Uncertainty Index from NFIB has risen each of the past three months with September's 2-point increase bringing it back to the same level as March of this year. In other words, it is perhaps best to say that small businesses are cautiously optimistic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Uncertainty.png))**\n\n&gt; From the pandemic to the Election, there are plenty of reasons for businesses to be uncertain. As for what they are reporting to be the biggest problems, labor remains at the top. 30% of businesses have reported that either cost (9%) or more predominately quality (21%) of labor are their biggest issues. While off the highs from the past few years, the current readings are still historically elevated.\n\n&gt; Behind labor, government related problems also are largely on the minds of business owners. Government red tape and taxes combine to account for 29% of businesses' biggest problems. While that is a large share, neither of those indices are at any sort of extreme.\n\n&gt; Poor sales, on the other hand, remains as the third major concern for businesses. 12% of businesses reported poor sales as the single most important issue in September, down from 15% in August and 7-percentage points lower than the April peak. While improved, the number of businesses seeing demand as a major issue is still at some of the highest levels of the past several years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Most-Import-Problems.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment By State\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the year-to-date reading for the high-frequency Morning Consult daily consumer sentiment indicator. While still well off highs seen prior to the COVID Crash in late February and early March, sentiment has generally been ticking higher off the lows. You'll notice in the chart below, however, that while the \"Future Expectations\" reading is still bouncing back nicely, the \"Current Conditions\" reading has been going more sideways over the last couple of months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101420-MC.png))**\n\n&gt; We can also look closer into state level readings from the daily Morning Consult sentiment numbers. In the heat map below, we show the changes in the levels of consumer sentiment for each state since mid-February. As shown, the lower 48 have seen much larger improvements than Alaska or Hawaii with the largest improvements coming in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. On the other hand, in addition to Hawaii and Alaska, some of the key swing states like Maine, New Hampshire, and Nevada have improved the least. Of all 50 states, Vermont's current reading on sentiment is the closest to its February levels, but even Vermont is still down 17.9 points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101420-MC-By-State.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ffP3FJL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/nGdIfrv.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.19.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9fUPN3h.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xQoRNmb.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sWeYEHF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne3gwPi.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.21.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bNGBGWs.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uPFnifS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lk20RGG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I007KF1.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I0WSfDw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.23.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Tesla, Inc. $439.67\n**Tesla, Inc.

      "selftext": "As I have posted a handful of times here, Purple continues to be an underappreciated consumer brand growth story utilizing an omni-channel approach. I first posted my recommendation when the shares were back at $18 - see last post here including a link to my original research laying out justification for the price target of $26-$30 in the near term ([https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j6c979/purple\\_innovation\\_prpl\\_price\\_target\\_raised\\_to\\_37/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j6c979/purple_innovation_prpl_price_target_raised_to_37/))\n\nSince then, Oppenheimer raised its target to $37 and UBS initiated coverage calling PRPL the best play in the bedding industry with a price target of $35. Now that the shares have rallied to over $31, I personally have trimmed back the position (though still hold a meaningful amount of long dated 17.5 call positions). With the chart showing the shares hitting an RSI of 70+, we may be churning for a bit or see some retracement ahead of earnings.\n\nFor the stock to meaningfully appreciate from here, we need to see a quarter posting revenues north of $200MM (earnings release in November) and solid guidance.\n\nCongratulations to all who got in on the dip. It has been a nice run.\n\nNow turning my attention to IPOB (OpenDoor, trading at 3.4x 2021 revenue) while Zillow trades at 5-6x+ forward revenue despite slower growth and a less transformational model. Another play now is also OAC (ForHims) - telehealth platform trading at an implied steep discount to other comps, including TDOC, LVGO, etc. Warrants on OAC still have the favorable structure (no diminution of upside after $18/share) and running their value on the basis of a Black-Sholes/options pricing model implies fair value of $3-$4/warrant vs. the $1.7 price they are now.\n\nGood luck to all.",

There is not a lot of newness. There is not a lot of fashion, and I think that consumers are going to look for that. So I worry very much about the department store space. You could talk about Macy’s or Nordstrom, but I think they have cut back inventory and their appeal is very low right now.

      "selftext": "**Introduction:**  \n \n\nAMC Entertainment and Cinemark are the two largest U.S. theater companies. \n\n* AMC is the largest theater chain in the U.S. and the world.\n   *  AMC has acquired Carmike Cinemas along with the European Odeon and Nordic shortly thereafter. \n   * AMC operates 630+ theaters in the U.S. and 365 theaters in Europe.\n   * There are even plans for AMC to open theaters in Saudi Arabia.\n* Cinemark is the second largest in the U.S.\n   * It operates 342 US theaters\n   * Operates 205 theaters across Latin America. \n   * In an interesting twist Cinemark has a 25% stake in National Cinemedia (NASDAQ: NCMI) (The focus for NCMI is advertising)  \n\n\n**52 Week Highs/Lows:**\n\n* AMC High: $10.95 / Low 1.95$ - Currently trading at $3.04 (17 October)\n* CNK High $37.83 / Low $5.71 - Currently trading at $7.86 (17 October)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Comparing the balance sheets (At a glance):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore this comparison just some quick notes: Movie attendance has decreased gradually over the last 20 years. Both Cinemark and AMC have released rewards programs which has actually increased attendance in 2019 (And then a wild COVID appeared). Additionally both companies have increased their prices to bump up their revenues over the years. (Popcorn obv tastes better when you spend 500$ on it)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAMC has spend the last several years buying up Cinema chain (Lots of acquisitions in 2016-17), naturally the fund this they loaded up on debt. So, naturally, COVID-19 has put the company in a very difficult spot. \n\n* Last year the company had $340 million in interest payments.\n* It's debt totals over $5 billion. (As of last year)\n* AMC is holding just $198.5 million in cash\n* AMC has more theaters in high-rent locations compared to Cinemark - This lowers their revenue.\n* Their current debt is 5x their current  EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)\n\nAMC is currently in fund-raising mode, they have stated they have enough funds through the year and possibly a bit longer. Recently though AMC has made a deal with Universal. A step into the streaming market, especially during these lockdowns, could move the company in a brighter direction if they can weather their current conditions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCinemark, unlike AMC, has committed to more conservative growth, a move that puts Cinemark in an excellent position to weather the current COVID downturns.  \n\n* CNK has over $571.76 million in cash\n* Additonally they have access to over $100 million in additional credit\n* Their expenses total to \\~$520 million if we lump their interest and lease payments. (Plus some other obligations I'm sure)\n* Their current debt is \\~2x their current  EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)\n\nCinemark has states they have enough money to last through 2021 comfortably. One important note, unlike AMC, Cinemark does not appear to have made move  towards streaming services. This could impact their future revenues if theater attendance continues to decline more in favor for streaming. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Takeaway:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis choice definitely comes down to personal risk tolerance, and depend on your view of the resiliency of the movie industry. Theaters have been on the decline for years, the reward programs have decreased this flow a bit, but how much will it continue to do so especially if people have unsubscribed from these to pinch pennies during COVID?  \n\n\nAMC is definitely the riskier of the two, they have tons of debt and Europe has seen less theater attendance than Latin America has for CNK. However if AMC survives (by its own means or government money), there is potential for stronger upside, especially since they are getting their foot in the door with universal.   \n\n\nCinemark's conservative growth is definitely paying off during this time. However, if AMC does survive then what will Cinemark's moves be in the future to ensure their continues relevance as theaters continue to decline?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo I think these (AMC &amp; CNK) are super long term holds? I am hesitant to say. Looking at a 1-2 year window I do believe they both have strong potential for profit. Beyond that it is difficult to say. AMC's moves with universal could put the company on a new future path away from traditional theaters. It'll be interesting to see where that goes and what Cinemark will do to move itself from a potentially dying market. If you buy definitely set stop-losses just incase, and/or plan an exit price. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThankyou to all that have read this far. This is not all inclusive so please please do your own research to supplement the quick comparison here. Additionally thankyou to everyone who provided constructive comments on the AT&amp;T post. That was definitely more of a controversial stock, it was interesting to hear everyone's different takes.",

Last 6 months sometime I improved myself on trading with some technical analysis videos readings suggestions etc but not too much. and I started to trade  last week. There are too much stocks and there is no enough time.   \n\n\nIs there any filter idea that it can be help me to show stocks which is close to their critical prices like support or resistance.  \n\n\nBy the way when I trade I have one basic methodology. If you suggest something to develope myself it will be appreciated. \n\nThe methodology I follow is   \n\n\n1- Find strong support and resistance on Weekly charts,   \n2- Go to daily chart and check again some support and reistance ( they will be not very strong support or resistance level )   \n3- Try to draw trend lines ( also try to see formation but I am not formation fan )  \n4- Check with MA EMA ( If the price also use ma or sma as support or resistance ıt can give idea )   \n5- Note stocks which is close defined support or resistance   \n6- Take action when it bounce from lines and sell it on target profit percentage  \n\n\nMy target is for TP  : %5  \nMy SL : -%2 -%3  \n\n\nLast week I did 3 trade and average profit was %5.5 . It was good week I know that every week will not be like this.",

Do so speculations on EV hype tanking.\nNIO has been only buy and hold this year.\n \nAfter Months of research and opinions, and later i drove a Tesla this year for the first time. I purchased a Tesla Cybertruck $100 pre order. I think Electric vehicles are truly the future and ICE companies are long behind the trend. Even though these ICE conpanies are moving to EV. Many dont have the Tech and customer likeness that Tesla has. ICE companies will struggle getting their loyal customers to switch to EV vehicles. While Tesla never needed that switch. In fact Tesla is actually stealing ICE customers and has been for years.\n\nWe can go ahead and assume Tesla owners are not going to go back to a ICE vehicle unless it was for financial situations and vehicle space. \n\nIll be honest i, i wouldnt pay 45k for a small model 3 sedan when i could just buy a large crew cab luxury Ram for 40k.\n\nHowever, Tesla vehicles lose 10% value each year compared to 20% In ICE vehicles.\n\n\nBack to NIO\n\n1. They  have 3 vehciles right now with a recent model thst was released mid of 2020. They will have another vehicle released January 6th 2021, on NIO day. Thats 2 new vehicles released in one year span. Bring it to a total of 4 vehicles. This is relatively easy for them because they dont actually own a single factory. They pay JAC motors to build them vehicles.\n\n2. They are backed by the government. The chieese government i vested $1.1 billion dollars into their company 2 months ago if they agreed to relocate their headquarters in Hefei, China. Its about 200 miles west of Shanghai, China.\n\n3. They are the only other EV with actually reasonable vehicles for consumers.\n\n4. The CEO and founder is \"William Li\". He is a billionaire who also co-founded a publically traded company named \"BitAuto\" (BITA) its an auto review company in China.\n\n5. They have over 100 stations in China that swap batteries for new fully charged ones in 5 mins.\n\n6. Their negative quarterly margin is shrinking very fast and if the rate continues, they will have positive profitable margins by next year.\n\n7. William Li said october 10th, Nio's vehicle production target is 150,000 total sales and he wants to double that to 300,000 by end of 2021.\n\n8. They have an auto driving feature called. NIO pilot.  \n\nThe in-house developed NIO Pilot, empowered by Mobileye EyeQ4, boasts over 20 driver assistance features and supports firmware-over-the-air updates. Always evolving, always up-to-date.\n\n9. They have NIO SERVICE, which are vans with batteries that can charge an EV on the go, if you run out of Electricity on the side of the road. \n\n10. They are limited to 5,000 vehicles per month by JAC motors. JAC MOTORS is the company that actually makes the NIO vehicles.\n\n11. The Nio Es6 is a high comparable vehicle to the Tesla Model X with simalir pricing.\n\n12. NIO's reported customer loyalty referral is 3 times higher than Tesla's in China.\n\n13. NIO BASS (battery as a Service) is a subscription-based battery service where you will be able upgrade copacity in the future. It includes the battery swaping stations they have placed around cities. \n\nSo there is all the main info i found about this Car Company. I really think if it will thrive in the future, as long as they dont screw it up. Its risky of course. Just like Tesla. \n\nBut the main reason i think we will see NIO reach Tesla in China is because the Chineesr culture is just like American culture. We love seeing made in USA products, just like they love seeing Made in China products.\n\nI think that people were forced to buy Tesla in China because the chineese people didnt have a choice. But now that NIO is starting to look like the next Battery started EV company, we can see them overcoming Tesla in China in the next 5 years.\n\nBut i will also say that Tesla vehicles are more efficient in their vehciles in many ways, I still think NIO will thrive in China.",

To avoid bankruptcy I assume they need to eventually approach pre-Covid revenue as otherwise they will be losing money continually.

They will not adjust to the changing retail landscape but rather squeeze whatever money is left until there is nothing left. \n\n2: Nordstrom will operate at perhaps 70 % of past revenue and eventually approach 100 % and in the future experience an economic profit. They will show signs of digitalization, change their stores and organization and adapt continually- close many full line stores, open more racks and locals. \n\nDo you hold any JWN and why?",

      "selftext": "Heading into the heart of the third-quarter earnings season, you might do well to buy shares of Google parent Alphabet.\n\nBernstein analyst Mark Shmulik on Friday weighed in with an earnings preview for the social-media stocks, lifting his price targets for Facebook (ticker: FB) to $300 from $285, Pinterest (PINS) to $41 from $35, Snap (SNAP) to $32 from $28, and Twitter (TWTR) to $45, from $42. He keeps Outperform ratings on Facebook and Snap, and Market Perform ratings on Pinterest and Twitter.\n\nBut the story Shmulik likes best is Google. “If you’re looking for upside potential, it’s hard to look past Google,” he writes in a research note. “The mid cap stocks (Twitter, Snap, Pinterest) have had quite the run these past few months and the embedded expectations are sky high. Facebook should do just fine, but again the expectations appear embedded in the price.\n\n“That leaves Google, the ‘Internet stock left behind’ during the recovery off the bottom. If Google can inflect search revenue growth back into positive territory, close the revenue growth gap with Facebook, and create positive momentum on Cloud/YouTube, that should be enough.”\n\nThe analyst notes that search is still about 60% of Alphabet’s revenue, and remains “the heart and soul of the company” and the key focus for investors. “If search misses, beats elsewhere don’t matter,” Shmulik writes, pointing out that management has said search exited June flat year over year, with modest improvement in July. “That’s the bar.”\n\nHe notes that there is some recovery off the bottom in travel-related searches, and retail-related queries are reaching new heights. “With Amazon now consistently participating in product-related searches, keyword clearing prices are up 15%+,” he writes. “We take search up to up 4% [for the quarter]—right around the bogey.” Shmulik maintains his Outperform rating and $1,800 target price on Alphabet shares (GOOGL).\n\nFor the broader group, he writes, “the 10,000 foot view suggests a cautious path forward.” Shmulik notes that Facebook and Alphabet have pulled back a bit this quarter, “with regulatory activity heavy enough to weigh over the stocks and an election on the horizon.” And he notes that the mid-cap names in the group are trading at or near all-time highs.\n\n“It’s nice to think that 2021 is all easy comps and we’ll have a bigger digital ad TAM [total addressable market], yet we still don’t have clarity on if and when revenues get back on the pre-Covid track. What’s already priced in? The only certainty remains uncertainty.”\n\nSource: Barron's",

As [America's second largest retail grocery chain](https://fortune.com/company/albertsons-cos/fortune500/), **ACI has quietly sat in the shadows and has raked in cash, literally.**\n\nNot only have they done extremely well as their [Q1 earnings prove](https://investor.albertsonscompanies.com/news/press-release/2020/Albertsons-Companies-Inc.-Reports-First-Quarter-Results/) they were recently awarded **Grocery retailer of the year** by Supermarket News on [July 09](https://www.supermarketnews.com/retail-financial/albertsons-named-supermarket-news-retailer-year) and again on [October 16](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/16/2109886/0/en/Albertsons-Companies-named-Retailer-of-the-Year-by-Store-Brands-magazine-for-its-Own-Brands-success.html) by Store Brand Magazine. \n\nIn addition to their recent awards [Albertsons bought an entire group of stores from a bankrupt east coast chain](https://boisedev.com/news/2020/10/14/albertsons-buys-group-of-stores-from-bankrupt-east-coast-chain/), and then [declared a dividend](https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2083589539543/albertsons-sets-its-first-dividend-as-a-public-company). All within a week. Albertsons said its \"strong and consistent levels of free cash flow\" allows it to pay out the dividend. **Albertsons 2020 has been adding consistent growth and investor value at a record breaking pace.**\n\nFor those that haven't already done their Due Diligence on Albertsons Companies, they have **increased same-store sales for 10 straight quarters**. Yes, even before covid-19. If anything, they have only benefited from the national safety protocols that were put in place along with non-essential business closures, as they were seen as an essential business. Even work from home implementation by thousands of businesses has donated quite heavily to Albertsons Companies bottom line, and as of today it appears they will continue to do so well into 2021.\n\nForbes has recently stated that Coronavirus has [permanently disrupted](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2020/03/24/grocery-retail-is-going-to-be-permanently-disrupted-by-coronavirus/#524f6f794633) grocery retail, but in a positive way. **The United States Census Bureau** just released their Advanced Monthly Sales for Retail and Food Services report report which shows and verifies sales just continue to rise. [FOR RELEASE AT 8:30 AM EDT, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2020](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf)\n\nNot only are grocery store chains preparing for a 2nd wave of pandemic shopping now, but according to new data from Lendingtree American consumers’ average weekly grocery spending has increased by 17% since pre-pandemic times, up from [$163 to $190](https://www.lendingtree.com/credit-cards/survey-grocery-shopping-food-buying-pandemic/). \n\n**Some Grocers report they're starting to see** [**round two of panic shopping**](https://www.today.com/food/grocery-stores-prepare-2nd-wave-pandemic-panic-shopping-t195036) **reported October 16.**\n\n“As of now what we are seeing is the start of the second wave of panic,” said Chris Mentzer, the director of operations for Rastelli Market Fresh in New Jersey. “Our customers keep telling me how they are looking for any type of freezer to purchase so they can start stocking up their homes now. Their main concern is meat.\" He explained that customers are mainly looking to buy and freeze beef and poultry — ground beef, steaks, roasts and all varieties of chicken.\n\n\"They're also starting to buy a lot of frozen meals and frozen pizzas,\" said Mentzer. \"We are seeing anything that can be microwaved quickly or easily made in the oven for kids, fly off the shelves, as people are preparing for schools and colleges to be closed this winter — along with a run on dried goods and paper goods, as well.” Grocers are all too familiar with the increased sales of the upcoming holiday seasons, but when coupled with panic pandemic buying the demand on Grocers to keep adequate supply will be immense.\n\nACI seems to be prepared to benefit and prosper from the insane demands well into 2021. Remember, Albertsons 2020 is not the same company as they were in 2015 or even 2018. Under their new CEO [debt has been reduced by Billions of dollars](https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2061824836428/this-dirt-cheap-grocery-stock-just-got-a-sweet-deal-on-its-own-shares), that's with a (B), and by restructuring their long term debts while federal interest was at /near zero percent they have become a much leaner, and even more efficient company.\n\nThe current PEG ratio that is very popular and most referred to when measuring a company's growth tells a story of huge potential for ACI 2020 investors. With a PEG at 0.40 it's clear that the unnoticed stock is [extremely undervalued](https://investorplace.com/2020/07/the-largely-ignored-aci-stock-ipo-presents-a-great-opportunity/). For perspective sake, if a company's PEG ratio is 1.0 that would indicate that the price of the stock accurately reflects its growth. So a PEG of 0.50 would indicate an **extreme undervalue on share price**. Yet, as stated above, ACI has a PEG of 0.40. It's well known that ACI shares are hugely discounted and it's even been reported that [Albertsons is called an undervalued sleeper by BofA.](https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2055074560870/albertsons-called-undervalued-sleeper-by-bofa)\n\nCouple all the recent positive catalysts with the fact that Albertsons Companies has seen **sales rise over 20% in Q1** and a [275% jump in digital sales since Covid-19](https://www.supermarketnews.com/retail-financial/albertsons-sees-sales-rise-over-20-q1-2020) and one can only assume that their earnings report scheduled for October 20, 2020 will be positive. Many investors have either completely overlooked ACI in their chase for the next EV stock to pop or have not done any due diligence on Albertsons Companies of 2020. However, Attentive Investors and Insiders seem to be certain that the path upwards for ACI is coming fast and the potential for $20 plus share price is not only obvious but long overdue.\n\nReports are indicating that there were more than several [insider trading activities](https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2042791264203/albertsons-companies-inc-nyseaci-ceo-vivek-sankaran-buys-25000-shares) at ACI including Sankaran Vivek, who purchased 25,000 shares at the price of $14.74 back on Aug 14 two weeks after the Q1 results on July 27. He seems to be very confident in the fact that shares are still heavily undervalued and will move upwards to a fair value soon. Sankaran Vivek now owns 1,961,782 shares of Albertsons Companies Inc.\n\n[The consensus price target by 18 Analysts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=ACI) is $19.38. The high price target is $26.00. From today's entry price of $14.26 a share, this could be a very lucrative opportunity for the increasingly attentive investors of that have done their homework on the Albertsons of 2020.",

      "selftext": "Analysts are ratcheting up expectations for Netflix ￼ ahead of the company’s third-quarter-earnings report on Tuesday.\n\nThree months ago, Netflix (ticker: NFLX) set a low bar for its most important operating metric: net new subscriber adds. After gains of 15.8 million in the March quarter and 10.1 million in the June quarter, the company projected a gain of just 2.6 million for the September quarter, temporarily muffling bullish sentiment on the stock.\n\nSome analysts think the company was too conservative. Netflix’s guidance called for revenue of $6.3 billion and profits of $2.09 a share; Street consensus is a little higher at $6.4 billion and $2.13 a share, respectively. But subscribers drive this stock, and on that front, some on the Street see a potential blowout—although there are some offsetting factors this quarter, including the controversy around the French film “Cuties,” which some have criticized as child pornography. (As an aside: Ignore the haters. It’s a thoughtful examination of the pressures on tween girls from social media. Go ahead, watch it.)\n\nLast week, J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth took his estimate on net new subscribers up to 5.1 million from 3.1 million. On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry lifted his forecast to 6 million subscribers, and boosted his target price to a Street-high $670 from $600. And on Friday, a flurry of other analysts weighed in.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne repeated his Overweight rating, and lifted his target to $630 from $600. “We continue to see short- and long-term benefits to Netflix growth and earnings power due to the changes brought on by the pandemic,” he wrote in a research note. “The virtuous cycle of leading global distribution scale and rising investments in film, unscripted and local originals should create increasing and outsize returns.”\n\nSwinburne’s subscriber outlook for the quarter is a conservative 2.5 million. But he added the company this year should be free-cash-flow positive for the first time since it began building the streaming business.\n\nBofA Global Research analyst Nat Schindler on Friday repeated his Buy rating and raised his target to $670 from $575. He sees subscriber adds about in line with guidance, with some risk on that front from accelerated churn as a result of the controversy around “Cuties,” the return of live sports, and ongoing competition in streaming from Walt Disney ￼’s (DIS) Disney+, Comcast ￼’s (CMCSA) Peacock and others. But he added that any short-term issues on subscriber growth does not impact the long-term growth for Netflix. “We continue to see the acceleration in Netflix subscriber penetration in [the first half] as a permanent benefit,” he wrote. “Investors should view potential valuation volatility driven by near-term subscriber trends as a particularly attractive opportunity.”\n\nDeutsche Bank’s Bryan Kraft reiterated his Buy rating, taking his price target up to $570 from $525. “We believe Netflix is a long term structural winner, and while the valuation does not leave much room for multiple expansion, we believe a Q3 subscriber beat, followed by a strong Q4 and price increases, will reinforce the bull case for the stock, allowing it to grind higher over the next 12 months, and possibly work to some degree in the short term as well,” he wrote.\n\nMonness Crespi Hardt’s Brian White repeated his Buy rating and $600 target. He wrote that the company’s position has been meaningfully improved by the pandemic. “This crisis has clearly accelerated a natural secular trend that was already playing out; however, we are now watching important pillars of an American entertainment institution starting to wobble, the movie theater experience,” he wrote. “This destruction is occurring due to the extent of this pandemic, coming at a time when Netflix has developed a strong footing in original content and global scale. Sitting inside a dark, indoor movie theater with strangers during a pandemic is not most people’s idea of a good time. Moreover, this experience is more expensive and time consuming.” He took a conservative approach on subscriber adds, projecting 2.5 million.\n\nSource: Barron's",

It also provides the \"Blink Network\", a cloud that  tracks charging stations and the associated charging data. This data provides property owners, managers, and parking companies remote monitoring and management of EV charging stations and payment processing. Additionally it provides drivers with station information, info such as location, availability, and applicable fees.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Current setup:**\n\nAs of December 2019 it has approx. 14,700+ EV charging stations across the US East Coast, West Coast, and locations in the Mid-West. Additionally they are expanding into Europe and the Middle East. (Can't attach the map because rules)\n\nThe following types of locations currently have stations (It is pretty much where you'd expect):  airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medicals, hotels, municipal locations, residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Predictions:** \n\nEV charging industry is projected to be a $112 billion industry by 2027.  The growing demand and sentiment for electric vehicles is a major factor responsible for aggressive growth. Additionally expansion of this industry will increase rapidly as more world governments move towards becoming carbon-neutral status the next few decades. \n\n*  In 2018 US EV sales were up 81% from 2017\n*  In 2018 global EV sales totaled 2.1 million, up 64% from 2017\n* There are currently more than 1.2 million electric vehicles in the U.S.\n* The global EV market is expected to grow at a 25.6% CAGR from 2019-2026 and is forecasted to reach over $567B by 2026\n*  By 2025 EV sales are projected to account for 30% of all global vehicle sales \n*  By 2030, the US is estimated to need 13 million charging stations \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Recent Developments for Blink:**\n\n* Agreement with Cushman &amp; Wakefield for Deployment of EV Charging Stations \n* Agreement with InterEnergy for the purchase of $1.2 million of Blink EV charging equipment to be deployed in the Dominican Republic\n* Co-recipient of a $900,000 grant from the BIRD energy program for the development of a DC fast-charging solution\n* Reached more than 23,000 deployments of EV charging stations at multiple living complexes and offices\n* Migrated the Blink Network to Microsoft Azure to optimize performance, operability and driver experience and prepare for future expansion\n* Expansion into Greece with Eunice Energy joint venture, deploying 40+ ports \n*  Blink enhanced its software to work seamlessly with Google Maps \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA more recent agreement with SG Blocks (NASDAQ: SGBX) aims to deploy a rapid and cost-effective innovative EV charging containers designed to provide off-grid charging solutions through a combined solar and battery components in multiple capacities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Competitors:**\n\nChargepoint (their main competitor, they are not publically traded) - focused on manufacturing and selling hardware (SemaConnect is another competitor we could lump here)\n\nEVgo, Electrify America - DCFC (Direct-current fast charger) charging solutions that are mainly beneficial for long road trips\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Blink Charging claims to stand out from their competitors claiming: \"We are the only company in the U.S. that can provide a full package of EV charging solutions under one roof, from start to finish!\"** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Prices &amp; Market Cap:**\n\n52 Week Range $1.25—$14.58 \n\nMarket Cap $310M \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Takeaway &amp; Final Thoughts:**\n\nInterest and sentiment towards Electric Vehicles has been booming and the EV charging industry is poised to grow along side them. Like many of the companies that produce electric cars, EV charging is not the most profitable right now, however, having the infrastructure in place sets Blink and Chargepoint in excellent positions to capitalize in this upcoming market. Additionally there is the possibility of future government subsidies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you to all that have read this. This is not all inclusive so please please do your own research to supplement, especially since I did not talk in depth about the company financials, and since there are many competitors in this emerging market.

Although once public im sure starlink will be a real winner it is important to realize that its a large market and there are also many limiting factors to spacex/ starlink without getting into to it i would like to introduce and interesting opportunity\n\nLorl- loral space and communication .on nyse currently trading at 20$ and some change\n\nThe meat and potatoes: \n\nLoral currently owns 64% of canadian satellite producer telesat the remainder is owned by canadas public pension. It is the fourth largest in the world and has been around for 50 years. It has been excellently run by dan goldberg maintaining strong cashflows and important contracts. \nTelesat is currently in the process to create/ have in orbit a leo conetellation for 2022 which is said to cover the globe. So far the tech has been proven strong. \n\nTelesat will be selling some of its u.s spectrum in december in the public auction and will receive 375$ mil usd which is 1/3 or lorals current market cap. It is also in the process to possibly sell spectum in canada at auction but so far no word on that yet. Its annual revenue has been fairly consistent in the $800-1 bil mark which alone makes loral a value play with a market cap just over 600 mil.\n\nMy thesis: \n\ntelesat will be going a different route offering backflow internet to customers with leo( going through existing isp)now some people have voiced criticism at this when comparing to spaceexs direct to consumer. The reality of our world is that many nations will not allow direct to consumer due to censorship as well as the heavily engrained relationships between current providers and government. Which will make backflow the way to go. Telesat is also working with lockheed martin and the pentagon but not much info on that.\n\nTelesat just announced a partnership with nelco india which is huge as india has the second largest internet market in the world and nelco has stong government ties. Telesat also just announced further contract with darpa which could prove to be huge in the comimg years. Telesat also has a large existing revenue base from its ongoing operations. \n\nThe risk: \nMhr fund is the largest and most influential shareholder of loral. Mhr/ public pension failed to reach a deal to sell telesat for 7bil or 75$/ share in 2015 due to some squabbling. In april of this year loral announced it is in advanced discussions with publc pension to take telesat public but no announcement has been made yet. \n\nTelesat has already made major partnerships for its leo system so if it fails to secure funding it could be brutal. I for one dont believe these partnerships would have been announced recently if it wasnt a given that funding/ ipo will be announced soon. \n\nTelesat has the lobbying/ history and tech expertise to be a leader in the space race. Their partnerships in india north america and throughout the world will create a strong customer demand for their constellation. I believe we are on the cusp of some big announcements which will drive share price not to mention the value play already discussed. Hopefully mhr and public pension can work together to launch telesat in the the next huge phase of its companies history.",

Doesn't seem very encouraging.\n\nAside from trying to get in on this myself, I wonder if there might be one or more people in this group, experienced traders, who would be interested in partnering with me.

This fund follows the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index and it's Market-Cap Weighted. Overall, this fund focuses on the CORE components of renewable energy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green ETF *(QCLN)* \\- This one is similar to ICLN. This globally diversified fund has the second-lowest ER out of the three standing at 0.60%. If you are interested in American Renewable concentration, this may be a contender for you as QCLN is 80% US weight. The top 3 countries as of now are the US, China, and Canada. This fund follows the NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index which holds 44 stocks, of which their top 10 accounts for 54% of the whole fund. This fund is very similar to ICLN though containing a few differences. ICLN focuses on Core Renewable Energy whereas QCLN focuses on Core Renewable Energy + Tech Built On Renewables. Tech Built On Renewables would consist of technologies such as EVs and Light-Emitting Diodes, supported by companies like TSLA, NIO, and OLED. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nALPS Clean Energy ETF *(ACES)* \\- This one is a little different. ACES has the highest ER out of the three standing at 0.65%.  This fund is NOT globally diversified, with its only focus on Canada (20%) and the US (80%). This fund follows a unique index known as the NACEX Index (which focuses on US/Canadian Clean Energy) and it is Market-Cap Weighted. The top 10 holdings account for about 50%. This ETF is very similar to QLCN (Core Renewable Energy + Tech Built On Renewables) *minus* the Global Diversification. Ultimately, this fund is a North American focused Renewable Energy Index Fund.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Fact Sheets**\n\nWhat I provided is very brief. If you're serious about clean energy, I highly recommend you read each Index Funds fact sheet along with the prospectuses. This will educate you on the field more and provide more crucial data for each fund.\n\nICLN - [https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/fact-sheet/icln-ishares-global-clean-energy-etf-fund-fact-sheet-en-us.pdf](https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/fact-sheet/icln-ishares-global-clean-energy-etf-fund-fact-sheet-en-us.pdf)\n\nQCLN - [https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=43c6d0cd-e6ca-4b21-b1b5-c4671b5cacb2](https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=43c6d0cd-e6ca-4b21-b1b5-c4671b5cacb2)\n\nACES - [https://www.alpsfunds.com/api/resources/77117043443a4093f7a3b3a4fce8989f.pdf](https://www.alpsfunds.com/api/resources/77117043443a4093f7a3b3a4fce8989f.pdf)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe main difference between each of these funds really comes down to the underlying holdings, sector allocations, and global diversification. Analyze your Risk Tolerance and Circle Of Competence in terms of holding/sector/globality for each fund before making a decision. \n\n**Disclaimer:** *I am* ***NOT*** *a financial expert. You* ***MUST*** *do your own diligence -- this is* ***ONLY*** *for educational purposes.* \n\nAlso sorry for leaving Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (PBW) out.

So far it reached its top in Jan 2020 and is now down 15% from that time. \n\nWhat’s a good tax strategy to minimize the capital gains I’ll owe on the profit - now or one day in the future... should I start gradually withdrawing the profit year by year or pull it all out now before the possible upcoming increase in capital gains (as expected if Biden wins)? \n\nI am of working age and bring in a decent salary that I hopefully will keep for the foreseeable future. Also I don’t have a compelling reason to get the profits out other than I’d like to diversify my investments and grow my portfolio - so I may reinvest the profits in another faster growing stock... or try something riskier like options. Although I can always do so with a margin loan from that stock balance. \n\nI realize my question may depend on multiple factors but I’m curious what are the general strategies to minimize the tax burden of capital gains. \n\nI am aware I can write off losses against it but ideally I would not incur any losses as I’ll be investing carefully and trying to rebalance and time everything accordingly. Do you feel better about making riskier investments knowing you can write off the losses against capital gains? Or if realizing losses may be inevitable (as I get into investing more and pull out of stocks I see are going down) do I first realize an inevitable loss and then and only then I pull out just the right amount of profit to offset that capital gains amount with my loss?\n\nI can always keep the account and let it grow - I have no doubt that given enough time, it’ll go back to where it was in January and exceed it. Yet if capital gains will go up, shouldn’t I at least realize the profit now while capital gains are lowest they’ll be in a while?\n\nEven if I pull out the gains from this stock in the long term future, when I retire and my income may be lower, I’ll still owe capital gains taxes on it... as I understand capital gains tax doesn’t depend much of at all on one’s income level.\n\nOr is there a smarter or simpler way to look at this?\n\nPS: I realize this is a newbie question so please spare me the judgment... I’m just trying to learn and can use some experienced advice.",

      "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI did a deep-dive on Fiverr ($FVRR) recently. While the stock has already run up a lot in 2020 (up +663% YTD), I think it is a very strong business that still provides a good opportunity for long term returns.\n\nWould love to know what you all think. I have posted a summary version here. If you are interested in a more detailed version, you can find it here: [https://knowyourstocks.substack.com/p/fiverr-fvrr](https://knowyourstocks.substack.com/p/fiverr-fvrr)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What does Fiverr do?**\n\nSimply put, Fiverr is an online marketplace that helps buyers and freelancers transact, solving many painful problems that buyers and freelancers used to experience in the traditional way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key stats, worth paying attention to:**\n\n* TTM (trailing 12 months) Revenue: $139M\n* TTM Gross Margin: 80.7%\n* Revenue Growth (3 Yr CAGR, ending Q2’20): 58% / 82% growth in the last quarter reported\n* No. of customers (ending Q2’20): 2.8M\n* Avg. yearly spend per customer (ending Q2’20): $184\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Things I like about Fiverr's business:**\n\n* Large, global TAM - many stats show that freelancing is growing globally\n* High gross margins, which is increasing\n* Both buyers and sellers have high NPS of 66 and 73 respectively \\[for reference, Amazon has an NPS of 62\\]\n* \\# Buyers and ARPU are growing simultaneously at a large rate. High repeat buying\n* COVID is a positive tailwind - structural changes to the market can last for a long time\n* Founder led business, who owns 12% of the company\n* Showed profitability in the last quarter and is projecting profitability in upcoming quarters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Things to think about:**\n\n* Regulatory changes in different geographic markets that can upset Fiverr's business models \\[e.g. if freelancers are not treated as gig workers but employees\\]\n* High valuation at the moment and upside remaining\n\nAn often-heard criticism of Fiverr is the low quality of service provided at times. Between Fiverr and Upwork, Upwork is more stringent with freelancers and also tends to focus on larger projects. At Fiverr, cheap services can sometimes mean poor quality.  However, this doesn't seem to be reflecting in the high NPS and growing ARPU of buyers. The repeat buying from customers also reveals that at a platform level, customers are satisfied with Fiverr.  \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Valuation**\n\nFiverr's current valuation is quite high (TTM EV/Sales of 43, which puts it in the same bracket as SaaS high flyers like Cloudflare). However, quality companies aren't cheap.\n\nI like the fact that the company is young, is still relatively small (market cap $6.2B), and has many areas to expand revenue and market cap (e.g. its recent initiatives like Fiverr Business helping it go upmarket, promoted gigs). Further, Fiverr's global nature provides it an opportunity to scale new initiatives to many different markets rapidly.\n\nThe upcoming earnings report on 28th Oct will tell us if Fiverr is continuing its growth trajectory. Any slight bump in growth can result in a big drop in the share price.  Depending on how you view the company long term, there could be opportunities in the future to open new positions. \n\n*Disclaimer*:  I have an active position at Fiverr (entered at $152.7). I will be adding more at dips.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI write about stocks in my weekly newsletter @[knowyourstocks.substack.com](https://knowyourstocks.substack.com/)\n\n**Disclaimer** \\- This post is just meant for information purposes.

      "selftext": "&gt; WASHINGTON — The Justice Department plans to accuse Google of maintaining an illegal monopoly over search and search advertising in a lawsuit to be filed on Tuesday, the government’s most significant legal challenge to a tech company’s market power in a generation, according to officials at the agency.\n\n&gt; In its suit, to be filed in a federal court in Washington, D.C., the agency will accuse Google, a unit of Alphabet, of illegally maintaining its monopoly over search through several exclusive business contracts and agreements that lock out competition, said the officials, who were not authorized to speak on the record. Such contracts include Google’s payment of billions of dollars to Apple to place the Google search engine as the default for iPhones.\n\n&gt; The agency will argue that Google, which controls about 80 percent of search queries in the United States, struck agreements with phone makers using Alphabet’s Android operating system to pre-load the search engine on their phones and make it hard for rival search engines to become a replacement. By using contracts to maintain its monopoly, competition and innovation has suffered, the suit with argue.\n\n&gt; The suit reflects the pushback against the power of the nation’s largest corporations, and especially technology giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. Conservatives like President Trump and liberals like Senator Elizabeth Warren have been highly critical of the concentration of power in a handful of tech behemoths.\n\n&gt; Attorney General William P. Barr, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, has played an unusually active role in the investigation. He pushed career Justice Department attorneys to bring the case by the end of September, prompting pushback from lawyers who wanted more time and complained of political influence. Mr. Barr has spoken publicly about the inquiry for months and set tight deadlines for the prosecutors leading the effort.\n\n&gt; The lawsuit  may stretch on for years and could set off a cascade of other antitrust lawsuits from state attorneys general. About four dozen states and jurisdictions have conducted parallel investigations and are expected to bring separate complaints against the company’s grip on technology for online advertising.\n\n[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/technology/google-antitrust.html)",

Apple introduced the new 5G-compatible iPhone 12 lineup last week.\n\nCredit Suisse analyst Matthew Cabral writes in a research note that as of Monday—four days before consumers can actually get the new Apple (ticker: AAPL) phones—preorders look similar to those at the same point in the iPhone 11 cycle. Wait times are longer for the iPhone 12 Pro than the flagship iPhone 12 in all markets, “fitting the pattern of higher-end users more likely to buy early in the launch cycle,” Cabral says.\n\nIPhone 12 Pro demand appears highest in Asia, he notes, where wait times exceed three weeks on most models in both Japan and Hong Kong, with waits of two to three weeks in China, one to three weeks in Europe, and less than two weeks in the U.S. He says iPhone 12 base model lead times are less than a week in the U.S., while wait times in Canada, Japan, and Hong Kong are running one to two weeks. Color options to not appear to be impacting wait times, he adds.\n\nCabral’s findings are consistent with a report yesterday from Taiwan-based analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities, who noted stronger-than-expected demand for the iPhone 12 Pro, with high levels of demand in China.\n\nApple began taking orders for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro last Friday, for delivery starting this Friday. Both have 6.1-inch displays. Buyers can preorder both the 5.4-inch iPhone 12 Mini and the 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max starting Nov. 6.\n\nSource: Barron's",

Some of the stocks are worth looking into, tho.\n\n&gt; McDonald’s (MCD) and Wingstop (WING) are the best-positioned stocks in the restaurant category under a Democrat sweep, according to the Raymond James analysis, while Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI), Outback Steakhouse’s Bloomin Brands (BLMN), and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) are best positioned in a Trump victory.\n\nOkay, whatever.\n\n&gt;  Sunnova Energy International (NOVA) and SunPower (SPWR) among possible winners in a Democrat sweep scenario, as well as biotechs Blueprint Medicines (BPMC), ChemoCentryx (CCXI), CymaBay Therapeutics (CBAY), and NGM Biopharmaceuticals (NGM).\n\nI'll look those up as the \"biotech etf\" and \"clean energy etf\" are probably not the most effective way to lean into these opportunities.\n\n&gt; It would also be good for industrial and material stocks and consumer discretionary, the analyst said. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines Holdings (UAL) find favor under a Democrat Sweep, as do United Parcel Service (UPS), FedEx (FDX), RingCentral (RNG) and Alibaba Group Holding (BABA), the report said.\n\nThis makes more sense as industrial &amp; consumer spending recovery are really dependent on a strong stimulus package. These are also the same kind of stocks that should benefit from a strong stimulus package if one gets agreed upon in the next few days, regardless of which candidate wins the election. \n\n&gt; A split government, with Biden in the White House and a GOP-controlled Senate, however, would likely mean budget battles and gridlock on legislation for health care, financials, telecom, tech and energy. An Infrastructure bill would be possible. Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), Delta and Southwest Airlines (LUV), Union Pacific (UNP), and Hyatt Hotels (H) do well under this scenario.\n\nA less-than-hopeful result is that Biden wins and the GOP retains control of the senate because that results in gridlock. While business usually welcomes gridlock, the pandemic is a particular situation where we need effective and nimble leadership so I think what's happening here is that Wall Street actually does not prefer a divided government right now. \n\n&gt; The least likely scenario at this point would be a status quo, where President Trump enters a second term with a GOP-led Senate but Democrat-controlled House. This is seen as best for financials, energy, communications services, health care, staples, utilities, and real estate. Legislative accomplishments are seen being light under this possibility. Best-positioned stocks under a status quo include Halliburton (HAL), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Boston Scientific (BSX), Toll Brothers (TOL), and Salesforce.com (CRM), Raymond James said.\n\nI think what we're seeing here are picks for more of the same situation that we're in right now, except maybe these stocks are ready to move up.  \n\nThis is all based on an analysis and presumably some simulations at Raymond James.\n\nDisclosure: I haven't looked closely at the above stock picks and am neither recommending them nor avoiding them. Personally, I'm increasing positions in old energy &amp; clean energy, am shifting to US industrial/aerospace and am out of the tech bubble stocks except for BABA &amp; JD because they're not dependent on the US economy either doing well or tanking.",

The shares are in the mid $10s range, and for the past year they have been staying at a pretty steady value, losing a few cents over a few months, then gaining a few more over the next few months, leveling out. There has been a very slight increase overall, over the past year in their value.\n\nOn the ESPP, I am purchasing my cap, and once the purchase period ends, I will be given a 10% discount on the lowest closing value, either from the day the period started, or the day the period ended and given the equivalent number of shares.\n\nMy question is:\n\nWhat would you do with the grant, the ESPP, and why?\n\nFrom my understanding, as long as the share price never dips lower than my initial purchase price, I will always turn a 10% profit of my investment due the discount.

I’m frustrated with this for some reason and I know there will be people who’s response are along the lines of “if you don’t have patience then just quit now”. \n\nI’m in this for the long term of course and I’m 21 today. My goal was to at least hit 17% per year short term and 30% long term (I know this is really out there but it pushes me to make better investing decisions).\n\nCurrent portfolio is 20.5% JPM, 28.4% BRK.B, 29.3% SPY, and 21.7% QQQ. These percentages are rounded up. BRK.B has been my biggest gain but that’s because I bought up below $190. \n\nRegrets: at one point my biggest holding was OKE, I averaged that sucker down very well to the point where I was already at very decent gains when above 27.50. I bought it up mostly in the 24, 25 range. My regret? I timed the market like a dummy, I sold above $28 think it would go down again because the volatility that occurred when I was holding. Now it’s staying at $29ish. I look on the bright side of this and remember that this was my “eh whatever” play. But it would have been nice if I have kept my holdings.\n\nMy second regret was a learning lesson. I had large holding in DFEN and ERX which rocketed me on June 8th but since that was my first time with leveraged ETFs, I didn’t know it would rank me just as much. Idk how much I would be up by if I was smart enough to sell on June 8th. I sold both at a loss. \n\nI followed people’s advice on here and just looked to QQQ more. I am wondering if anyone has experienced the same “underperformance” or frustration or if I’m not alone in that I’m not doing as well as I did before\n\nI’m also looking for advice, anything greatly appreciated. \n\nI will try my best to answer all comments and questions\n\nThanks",

      "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI want to get this community's view on a recent tech IPO - JFROG. \n\nI have researched the company and its business performance so far and it's very impressive indeed.  I have summarized my views below in a short post.  Would love to understand what people here think about the future potential of this company.\n\nIf someone has first-hand experience using their products, their views will be very helpful to get.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**JFrog ($FROG)**\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nJfrog makes software products for developers to manage their software releases in an efficient and secure way.\n\n**Things to like about the business:**\n\n1. Large addressable market of $24B by 2024\n2. Revenue growth of 50% YoY\n3. High gross margins (81%) --&gt; Puts them amongst the top SaaS companies\n4. Free cash flow positive for 5 years; \"Rule of 40\" measure of 56% is quite high\n5. Amongst the best net dollar retention rate of 139%. Driven by: (a) Focus on enterprise customers with high spending potential; and (b) Clever pricing, allowing it to charge more as usage grows\n\n**Things to worry about:**\n\nJFrog does have competition in the field, across the different stages of software release management. While the company seems to be doing well at the moment, they need to constantly innovate to stay competitive in the field, which is hardly a given.\n\nJFrog had a spectacular IPO (no surprises, given its impressive SaaS metrics) on Sept 15. It is now trading at $81.8/share (ending Monday, Oct 20 2020), up +86% from its IPO price of $44 /share.\n\nWith an Enterprise Value of $7.3B, JFrog’s TTM EV/Sales is 57x, which is very high and in my opinion, not deserved. \n\nAmong other high growth SaaS companies, its valuation rivals Shopify and only Datadog and Zoom has higher valuation multiple (All these companies have significantly higher revenue growth than JFrog)\n\nOverall I like JFrog’s business performance so far. I think long term the company looks to be headed in the right direction but short-term returns can be impacted by its high valuation currently. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA more detailed version of the above writeup is present at this link (along with other stocks I write about):  [https://knowyourstocks.substack.com/p/jfrog-frog-making-software-liquid](https://knowyourstocks.substack.com/p/jfrog-frog-making-software-liquid)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer** \\- This post is just meant for information purposes.

Corona virus, and competitors. \n\nI believe the articles focus on only negative aspects for some reason concerning phase 2 failure of opcinimab. \n\nThe positives are that tecifedra consumption is actually up, but maintenance doses are less than initial doses. They are selling more in other countries and emerging markets, spoke of regulatory talks with Japan China as well as others. \n\nNext month the true factor is USDA pending approval on their upcoming Aducanomab treatment for Alzheimer’s next month. Biogen has been preparing for a full release as planned and was optimistic about approval. \n\nThis would really impact Biogen in a huge way if accepted, and there has been good evidence to believe it will be. The company has shown to be undervalued as it maintains a strong balance sheet and just spent 5bn? (Don’t remember exactly) on stock buybacks announced today. \n\nNow if Adu- fails to be approved it could have an adverse affect on other pending approvals from other countries, same if its accepted then Biogen would have a greater chance of some other medications being pushed through in the rest of the global market.\n\nI remain optimistic, and the media narratives pushing this price low right now really makes it an attractive buy. Some revenue from its MS drugs have been pushed over to help Adu- prepare for launch. I’m 45% concentrated in Biogen and if accepted by USDA we could see this stock go extremely high, even past the 52 day average up into the high 300’s mid 400’s per share. Currently sitting at 262. I’m super excited! \nFeel free to clarify some things I may have missed or messed up.",

      "selftext": "**Introduction:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNokia is a stock that has been beaten down and out-of-favor for many years. This year it has popped down into the sub 5$ range (some would consider this to be penny stock range) several times and currently sits in this area. However, for Nokia, markets are slowly recognizing the potential, especially with the numerous upcoming contracts catalysts for the company. Let's take a look.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4G/LTE Connectivity for the Moon:**\n\n  \nNokia was selected by NASA to set up 4G  and to supply the other communications solutions for NASA’s space mission to the moon. This particular contract is only worth a meager $14.1 million, however it is just the start. This will be the first-ever cellular network on the moon. The win only reaffirms Nokia’s  LTE/4G reliability. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Replacement for Huawei 5G in Europe &amp; Other 5G contracts:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNokia has landed several contracts to replace China's Huawei as a 5G provider in Europe by 2028 due to security reasons. These contracts for mainly for the UK and Belgium at the moment. By 31 Dec this year the UK will ban their mobile providers from buying Huawei equipment. There are strong speculations that several other European nations will follow suit.    \n\n\nThe US DoD [i](https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2020/10/09/Defense-Dept-awards-600M-in-contracts-for-5G-testing-at-five-bases/2171602260363/)s awarding over $600 million in contracts  to test their 5G communications technology at five of its military sites and to incorporate 5G technologies for warfighters.. Nokia is one of many companies involved in this.  \n\n\nIn all Nokia has reached reached 100 5G deals and over 163 commercial 5G engagements worldwide. Now Nokia did lose out to Samsung when Verizon awarded it the contract to supply new 5G equipment to Verizon in the United States. This, according to some apparently spelled the \"doom\" for Nokia. However, this was before the NASA and a few other 5G contracts. Additionally,  this Monday Verizon struck deals with Microsoft and Nokia to set up and improve private 5G networks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Current price and some basic financials:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Current Trading Price - 4.20$ (21 October)\n\nREVENUE = 5.09B\n\nNET INCOME = 94.00M\n\nNET PROFIT MARGIN = 1.85%\n\nOPERATING INCOME = 316.00M\n\nCASH ON HAND = 7.09B\n\nCOST OF REVENUE = 3.08B\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Risks/Takeaways and Final Thoughts:**\n\nNokia doesn't consistently beat analyst estimates, additionally, despite a nearly universal consensus that its shares are undervalued, Nokia doesn't seem to be able to sustain momentum.  Nokia has been much higher than this in the past. When the company was a manufacturer of phones, the share price ran up above $30. Obviously, other mobile phone makers took control of the market.  \n\nThe company is now reinventing itself as a 5G powerhouse, with all the recent contracts things are possibly looking up for the company. Value investors seek out beaten down and out-of-favor stocks that are looking to make a strong comeback, perhaps now Nokia fits into this category.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs always thankyou for reading.  This is not all inclusive so please do your own research to supplement. Have a good day everyone!",

There is a shit ton of acronyms. \nSo I’m trying to figure out this trading app, I’m sure I’ll get flack for this, I have 3 shares each in PFE, PLUG, and SNE. I’m sure that’s not enough or not good enough for some, but I wanted to try this stock thing before I lost my ass. I have a shit ton already in my work 401K so I’m not worried about retirement. I want to do this as a fun learning experience, maybe have something for my kids so when they graduate in 5 and 7 years they have a little egg, or hopefully“buy me a set of boobs” for my birthday next month. \n\nI keep seeing comments about diversifying and such but I’m struggling with the app and struggling on what to do. I’ve watched a couple YouTube Videos and am confused even more, but I can’t call the app people because I don’t have a certain amount of money yet. So I thought I’d ask here in the hopes someone can dumb this shit down just a little bit more for me.\n\nI do have $100 delegated to go to the trading app every month. So my question is: what should I do from here? Keep purchasing with the 3 companies I have? Or is it dumb to buy 3 shares at $60 and then a month later buy another 3 at like $80 a share? Is there a magic number of shares I should purchase from each company and then buy from others if that is a thing? I thought I saw something in the app about rolling over dividends? But does that mean I’m still buying shares at the first price I bought for or what the price is on that day? Or I have to let it build and then when I have enough from dividends and money I have transferred in it buys another share? \n\nMy friend mentioned something about leaving any money or shares I have for at least a year in the stock market or there is a tax or penalty? \n\nOr am I being foolish and should I just sell what I have and just keep on with my 8% through my employer?",

Any time the price falls below that line I would buy, and then sell when it rises above it by a meaningful enough swing.  \nMy questions to the community are as follows:  \nWhat would be some good stocks to use this strategy on? They would have to be on a consistent, reliable upwards trend, with enough volatility to make the strategy worthwhile but enough stability to avoid significant short-term crashes. Also, looking to start with low-price stocks until I build up my reserves and sharpen my skills a bit.  \nAt what point above the Mean should I sell? Any point above would be (almost) guaranteed profit, but ideally you'd want to find a sweet spot that locks in a reliable, yet weighty ROI. But if I set that price point too high, I would undoubtedly miss several opportunities as the price cycles back and forth.  \nAnyways, thanks for putting up with my amateurish musings, and happy trading!",

On the **election** front, final debate is tonight, latest polls seem to be telling largely the same story, and top US intelligence official warned Iran and Russia were attempting to influence voters.

SQQQ DURING MARCH! AIRLINES! CRUISES! OIL!!!!!! TESLAA!!! TECH!!! INCOMING CRASH! OVERVALUED! UNDERVALUED! NEW IPOS! DUMP IT ALL IN QQQ OR VOO! HOLD THE LINE! SELL NOW WHILE YOU CAN! PULL OUT WHILE YOU CAN CASH IS KING!  GOLD!!!! DIVERSIFY! DON'T DIVERSIFY TOO MUCH! etc. etc.\n\nIt gets a bit overwhelming\n\nI just want to say for new investors.... EXPECT to make mistakes. Expect to lose money early on. \n\nAdditionally don't expect big name companies to just go up because they are strong. Sometimes they are incredibly overvalued and future estimates may not always be correct.\n\nI also don't believe the fundamental \"buy into companies you believe in or know of\", kind of bad advice tbh as you can love a company but it may not always be doing well.\n\nAlso, no one knows if the stock market is going up or down tomorrow. News is generally misleading, and most articles are just clickbait.\n\npeople generally say to \"hold\" forever until you make a profit. While this may be true with big companies, smaller companies or industries not doing too well and have bleak future outlooks will continue to drain you. There is a time to sell at a loss to transfer funds to more promising stocks.\n\nalso don't get caught up in hindsight. Yes people will always so \"you so dumb you should have invested in ____ stock months ago, you could have been rich\" and it tricks your mind into thinking you should invest in that stock now, but its too late and you end up losing money\n\nPersonally I'm glad I lost money early on. It showed me the volatility of the market, and it had me learn about my own anxieties with money and how much I'm willing to to lose. As a new investor start out small. You won't see any real gains, but at least you'll get some experience. The real \"fun\" starts at about $10,000+ as you will actually get a sense that you are making enough to actually be improving your future life.\n\nIts different for everyone, but as someone with a lot of anxiety, I've decided to park my investments into mutual/index funds. With individual stocks I was literally waking up and checking prices multiple times a day, and it actually affected my moods. Not good for mental health.\n\nAnyway ramble over :)",

Since they're in the energy business, large amounts of capital are required to start a business like this. \n\n2. They are expanding into renewable energies. Renewable energy is sort of speculative right now, but it's a good way to cover your bases in case oil becomes less consumed over time. \n\n3. They are not highly leveraged. Their debt to equity ratio is way lower (below 0.5) than any other energy company and they don't seem to be sacrificing large potential gains by not being so leveraged. \n\n4. They are trading below book value as of now. While the current stock price per share is currently around $12, the book value per share is a little over $17 per share. \n\n5. Despite not being highly leveraged, they still manage to pay dividends to shareholders (currently 5.47%). \n\nThere are some other reasons why I like this stock, but I wanted to see what other people have to say about it. I ended up buying at around $12/share so I might be a little biased on my reasons for liking it.",

NM-002 has proven to reduce gastric time in tested patients with SBS. They believe that NM-002 could offer significant improvements over the existing therapy options of SBS, which currently require daily injections. 9 Meters estimates sales to peak at 500 million dollars depending on the effect of TPN reduction.\n\n3) NM-003 is a long acting GLP-02 orphan indicator, indication TBD and is currently in the preclinical phase but is expecting lead indication selection in 2H 2020.\n\n4) Immunomodulator is also an orphan indicator, indication TBD and is currently finished phase 1 with the lead indication selection to be release 2H of 2020. \n\n9 Meters Biopharma holds, what i believe to be an underappreciated pipeline with no existing products in Larazotoide being used to treat Celiac Disease.",

The country is estimated to account for 35 to 45 per cent of global demand for the iPhone 12 Pro, according to a recent report from TF Securities International analyst Kuo Ming-Chi, who is known for his Apple analysis. There were between 7 million and 9 million pre-orders of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro globally during the first weekend of sales, according to Kuo.\n\nThe new iPhones have also proven to be a hot commodity on Chinese e-commerce sites. The available stock on JD.com sold out within 30 seconds after pre-orders started on October 16. And Alibaba, the parent company of the South China Morning Post, said that about 30 million users have searched for the new iPhones over the last 30 days on its Tmall marketplace. That is twice the search volume for the iPhone 11 in the same period last year.\n\nSales of the iPhone 12 could be aided by the fact that it is the first iPhone to support 5G after Apple skipped the feature last year. Sales of the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro reached an estimated 1.7 to 2 million units globally in the first 24 hours of pre-orders. The three iPhone 11 models only saw 500,000 to 800,000 units sold in the same period after pre-orders opened in September last year, according to the report from Kuo.",

      "selftext": "Found this quick article on yahoo finance that I think is worth leaving here.\n\n[Link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beating-earnings-expectations-is-meeting-expectations-morning-brief-095839670.html)\n\nConsider this before posting \"I own X stock, they beat earnings by $0.05/share and went down 3%, why?\"\n\n&gt;Corporate earnings are beating expectations at a record rate. Investors are hardly impressed.\n\n&gt;Third quarter earnings season is in full swing.\n\n&gt;And some early trends are emerging.\n\n&gt;For starters, companies are crushing expectations.\n\n&gt;According to data from Bespoke Investment Group’s Earnings Explorer tool, some 97 companies through Thursday morning had reported earnings that topped analyst estimates for both revenue and earnings per share since the start of last week. Of these, 22 have not only topped expectations for the third quarter but have also raised their forecasts for the current quarter or year ahead.\n\n&gt;Over the last three months, 77.5% of companies reporting results have topped Wall Street forecasts for earnings per share, increasing what was already a record share of companies reporting better-than-expected profits. To say that corporate earnings are faring better than feared is an understatement.\n\n&gt;But investors are also growing more reticent to reward these results. And have become quick to punish companies that fall short of expectations. Even modestly.\n\n&gt;On Thursday, shares of Chipotle (CMG) fell more than 4.5% after the company said Wednesday that restaurant level operating margins in the third quarter fell to 19.5% from 20.8% in the same quarter last year. And this margin hit coming as same-store-sales turned positive in the third quarter, rising 8.3% after a 9.8% drop in the second quarter.\n\n&gt;Of course, we must note that Chipotle has been one of the big winners in the fast food space during the pandemic: from the March 23 market lows through Wednesday’s close the stock rose 141% against a 49% increase for the S&amp;P 500. But embedded in this rally is future earnings growth, and Wednesday’s quarter makes the future appear less rosy than previously believed.\n\n&gt;And dynamic investors were quick to react to.\n\n&gt;Another high-flying pandemic winner, Netflix (NFLX), also saw its stock similarly punished earlier this week. Shares of the streaming giant fell more than 6% on Wednesday after the company said subscriber growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter.\n\n&gt;And both of these stock reactions track what Bespoke’s data suggests. Which is that amid an earnings period of strong results, investors are punishing earnings misses harshly. Just six companies since the start of the month have reported worse-than-expected earnings and revenue, according to Bespoke. Shares of these companies have declined by an average of 4.8% the next day.\n\n&gt;In contrast, companies reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue have seen shares rise by an average of 1.7%. Notably, companies also raising guidance along with besting top and bottom line forecasts are faring even worse, rising an average of just 0.25% during the day after these results.\n\n&gt;And an even better outline of just how lukewarm investors have been towards companies that merely meet expectations can be seen in the stock reaction to firms that offer guidance that is in-line with expectations.\n\n&gt;Twelve firms have offered in-line guidance and just one of these companies missed on EPS while just two missed on revenue. Results in the most recent quarter for this group, in other words, have been quite strong.\n\n&gt;And yet the average one-day stock performance among this group — which includes Netflix, Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), and UnitedHealthcare (UNH) — is a decline of 1.66%.\n\n&gt;And so in a market environment during which investors have quickly and enthusiastically looked past a brief but severe recession, a future full of high hopes is coming at the market fast.",

They actually managed to remain profitable last quarter unlike many other retailers like Macy's for instance. \n\nKohl's has good online sales, which grew by 58% last quarter. They are now focusing even more on athleisure, and active wear, which are higher growth categories. They've dedicated larger spaces in their stores to it, and just announced a new product line earlier this week. \n\nIf that wasn't enough, here's another article from 2 days ago ([source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bofa-bullish-kohls-210532539.html)) a few takeaways:\n\n\"Department store Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) said in a recent investor presentation that it expects to fully return to pre-pandemic operating margin levels and this is a bullish signal, according to BofA Securities.\"\n\n\n\"The Kohl's Thesis: Kohl's highlighted an operating margin goal of 7% to 8% in a normalized shopping environment, Hutchinson said in a Wednesday note.\n\nThis goal is not only consistent with historical trends, but marks an improvement from 2019's margin of 6.4%, the analyst said. \n\nThe company's strategy to achieve its goals include further sales growth in active apparel, supply chain improvements, sourcing initiatives, inventory management, operating efficiencies, store automation and improved marketing productivity...\"\n\n\nThis seems like a pretty healthy company to me. -55% on the year doesn't seem like a fair valuation. They're trading at a Pe of around 5-6. Historically they have traded at a pe of around 9. It seems as though this company will recover better and faster than a lot of it's rivals. There's a lot of potential for big upside at these prices. I could go on and on with the numbers here but others have already done that, so [here's one last article.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/10/16/kohls-stock-offers-strong-upside-at-20/amp/)\n\nTldr; Kohl's still undervalued. They are positioned better than rivals, they have promising new growth initiatives, and are trading at bargain levels still despite all of this. \n\nDisclaimer: I am long KSS",

I am delighted and a little relieved to report the flavor was fantastic. Also, it digested much better than real sausage. The initial bite was juicy and packed with a good flavor profile. I also noted the clean after taste\n\n Of course this is a subjective opinion but I thought other Beyond investors might appreciate \n\nI was curious to know reddits opinion of beyond meats products\n\nI have tried the burger a few times and came away a little dissapointed in the flavor",

      "selftext": "I like Square as a company and see a lot of people are bullish about it. However, a few things stop me from investing. Be interested to hear thoughts but at the moment I am a Square bear. \n\n**Management**\n\nJack Dorsey is a visionary. I don’t think this is controversial. However, his track record at Twitter is worrying for shareholders. Be it daily active user growth, ambition with acquisitions but ultimately failure to monetise a fantastic platform where you have big corporations, celebrities and even the President reaching out to 200m daily active users for free. With Square, the closed loop business model of businesses and consumers is again a fantastic concept that could break the power of Visa/Mastercard. Execution remains to be seen, of course. \n\n**Competition**\n\nSquare operate in a highly competitive field for consumers and businesses. Let’s take consumers based on Square’s fast-growing Cash App. It offers things a normal bank does like deposits, ATM access, money transfer. If it becomes a fully-fledged bank offering loans, credit; it is competing against the likes of big incumbents (e.g. JP Morgan, Bank of America). Granted they’re dinosaur firms but they already have a huge customer base that are older and, therefore, have more money and deposits. This means it is much easier for them to monetise their customers resulting in high ARPU. Why would these lucrative customers, en-masse, want to uproot their finances to Square when their existing providers will be providing the same service by copying Square, as JP Morgan have done this week? [Link](https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2020/jpmorgan-takes-on-square-and-paypal-at-the-point-of-sale/) \n\nFor businesses, Square’s provides software offering (invoicing, PoS, online store) but face strong competition from the likes of Shopify who are taking a fully integrated service approach to SMEs which allows them to take their business online but also manage all their backend processes, including payments. This is a highly convenient service for entrepreneurs. Shopify already has 6% share of the online retail market. Square also provides hardware products which make it easy for SMEs, in particular, to take payments. However, there is evidence that retail is facing a more permanent shift in the US vs. the rest of the world with 60% less footfall today than a year ago [Link](https://www.spring-board.info/benchmarks/benchmark/daily-footfall). 58% of Square’s GPV is from food/drink, retail and professional services. Square may have good market share but it is a shrinking industry.\n\nAnd as a final piece, competitors in both spaces are generally in very healthy financial shape: Paypal, Shopify, Global Payments, Western Union and big banks are well-capitalised. \n\n**Valuation**\n\nPerhaps you can get over the above with the fact that Square has strong network effects and are able to win customers cheaply. However, in my opinion, Square is priced for perfection. Simply looking at a price/sales metric, it is trading 13x LTM. This is high but maybe relatively reasonable for a fast-growing business. However, 25% of Square’s revenue is accounted by Bitcoin “revenue”. This brings little value to Square (2% gross profit) and even Square themselves discount this revenue in their KPIs because it is “out of their control and not reflective of Square’s performance”. \n\nNow onto profits. It is not fair to be too hard on Square’s profitability. After all, it is in high growth phase and its marketing costs were its highest opex line item at roughly 35% for YTD. However, a cursory look at it is Enterprise Value / EBITDA (forward look to Dec2020), it is 242x. If we give credit for Square’s business plan for a further two years, today’s Enterprise Value over broker consensus forecast EBITDA for 2022, it is still a heady 77x. This is when Square is supposed to have EBITDA of $1bn which is three times more than it is forecast for Dec 2020. Priced to perfection.\n\nIf you compare it to Paypal, it is trading at 39x and 27x EV / EBITDA for Dec 2020 and 2022.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSquare has formidable backers like Ark Invest. I am also not a great believer in “dumb retail” overvaluing a stock for a prolonged period of time. But for reasons above, I am cautious with Square and yet it keeps climbing so please tell me what I am missing…",

      "selftext": "I was looking to move some of my 401k money invested in stocks into T-Bills but my 401k doesn't offer a mutual fund that invests in T-Bills. It offers this product by Invesco called the Invesco Stable Value Trust ([https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/collective-trust-funds/products/product-detail?audienceType=Dc&amp;fundId=87](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/collective-trust-funds/products/product-detail?audienceType=Dc&amp;fundId=87)). The problem I have with the fund is although it uses T-Bills as a benchmark, it actually invests the money into a number of insurance companies through \"wrap\" contracts. \n\nDigging deeper I see two statements that worry me about SEC and CFTC oversight:\n\n\" No Registration Under U.S. Federal or State Securities Laws. The Fund will not be registered with the SEC as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) in reliance upon an exemption from the Investment Company Act; therefore, the provisions of the Investment Company Act applicable to registered investment companies (i.e., mutual funds) are not applicable to the Fund. Units of the Fund are exempt from registration under U.S. federal securities laws and, accordingly, this Fund Description does not contain information that would otherwise be included if registration were required. Similar reliance has been placed on exemptions from securities registration and qualification requirements under applicable state securities laws. No assurance can be given that the offering currently qualifies or will continue to qualify under one or more exemptions due to, among other things, the manner of distribution, the existence of similar offerings in the past or in the future, or the retroactive change of any securities laws or regulation. \"\n\n\" No Registration with the CFTC. Since the Fund may purchase, sell or trade exchange-traded futures contracts, options thereon, and other commodity interests, the Fund may be viewed as subject to regulation as a commodity pool under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act and the rules of the CFTC. However, pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5, the Trustee is exempt from having to register as a commodity pool operator with respect to the Fund. The Trustee has filed an exemption notice to effect the exemption and will comply with the requirements thereof. As a result, the Trustee, unlike a registered commodity pool operator, is not required to deliver a disclosure document or certified annual report to participating trusts. Nevertheless, all participating trusts will receive a copy of the Declaration of Trust as well as an annual report for the Fund. The Sub-Adviser, a registered commodity trading advisor under CFTC regulation, will provide commodity interest trading advice to the Fund as if it were exempt from registration as a commodity trading advisor with respect to the Fund pursuant to CFTC Regulation 4.14(a)(8)(i)(B). \"\n\nMy fears are probably unfounded, but I would love to know why this fund is set up this way and if it will offer similar risk to T-Bills (which is my investment objective)",

      "selftext": "# Introduction:\n\nThis post will focus on breaking down the differences between 3 of the largest clean energy ETFs, QCLN, ICLN, and PBW. The focus will be exclusively on these ETFs and not single stocks.  Now is an excellent time to invest in clean energy, According to several sources,  renewables are set to represent ¾ of the $12T the world invests in new power technology through 2040. For the US alone almost $2 trillion is the investment needed to implement renewable energy targets by 2030. \n\nNOTE:  It would be wise to keep a long-term investing mindset. Investments that focus on particular segments of the market can see significant short-term fluctuations in price. Additionally, in the past 10 years, clean energy ETFs have had returns that range from low single-digit gains to low single-digit declines. \n\nAlrighty let's get into it. \n\n# ICLN - iShares Global Clean Energy ETF : \n\nBetween the 3, ICLN currently has the most assets under management at $2.05B and the lowest expense ratio at 0.46%, however, it is also the least diversified, having only 30 current holdings.  This ETF tracks the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index. ICLN holds a portfolio of 'clean energy' companies, such as biofuels, ethanol, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar and wind industries. Additionally it also holds companies that develop technology and equipment used in the process. It does not have exposure to the Electric Vehicle Market! Of these 3 it has the most Global Exposure. \n\nTop 10 sectors (5 in this case since it doesn't even have 10):\n\n* Renewable Energy Equipment &amp; Services - **59.31%**\n* Electric Utilities - **25.80%**\n* Independent Power Producers - **9.28%**\n* Multiline Utilities - **3.28%**\n* Renewable Fuels - **2.32%**\n\nTop 10 holdings:  SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **7.50%,** Plug Power Inc. **7.21%,** Sunrun Inc. **7.16%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **6.97%,** Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd **6.24%,** First Solar, Inc **4.88%,** Vestas Wind Systems A/S **4.53%,** Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. **4.50%,** Contact Energy Limited**3.48%,** Boralex Inc. Class A **3.42%. (NOTE** Total Top 10 Weighting - **55.89%)**  \n \n\n# QCLN - First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy ETF:\n\nQCLN currently has $756 million assets under management with the middle expense ratio at 0.60%. Additionally, between these 3 ETFs, it is the second-most diversified with 43 current holdings. This ETF tracks the NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index, which, compared to the previous, includes a mix of U.S. and Canadian clean energy companies.  For this ETF companies are from the following four sub-sectors: advanced materials (that enable clean-energy/reduce need for oil products), energy intelligence (smart grid), energy storage and conversion (hybrid batteries), or renewable electricity generation (solar, wind, geothermal, etc). \n\nTop 10 sectors:\n\n* Renewable Energy Equipment &amp; Services - **32.34%**\n* Auto &amp; Truck Manufacturers - **23.97%**\n* Semiconductors - **13.18%**\n* Electric Utilities - **7.40%**\n* Electrical Components &amp; Equipment - **6.97%**\n* Commodity Chemicals - **5.97%**\n* Independent Power Producers - **3.21%**\n* Construction Supplies &amp; Fixtures - **2.45%**\n* Commercial REITs - **1.70%**\n* Heavy Electrical Equipment - **0.84%**\n\nTop 10 Holdings:  NIO Inc. Sponsored ADR Class A **10.00%,**  SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **7.03%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **6.53%,** Tesla Inc **5.94%,** Albemarle Corporation **5.06%,** ON Semiconductor Corporation **4.21%,** Brookfield Renewable Partners LP **4.08%,** Cree, Inc. **3.96%,** Universal Display Corporation **3.81%,** First Solar, Inc. **3.75%. (NOTE:** Total Top 10 Weighting - **54.37%)** \n\n# PBW - Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF:\n\nPBW currently has $962 million assets under management with the highest expense ratio of 0.70%, however it is also the most diversified with 48 current holdings. PBW is more diverse than just industry pure-plays like wind, solar, and biofuels, it aims to include companies based on their perceived relevance to the renewable energy space as well. Additionally, it follows a tiered, equal-weighting structure and caps any holding to a tax of 4%.\n\nTop 10 sectors:\n\n* Renewable Energy Equipment &amp; Services - **44.46%**\n* Auto &amp; Truck Manufacturers - **13.70%**\n* Semiconductors - **7.36%**\n* Commodity Chemicals - **6.74%**\n* Construction &amp; Engineering - **4.47%**\n* Industrial Machinery &amp; Equipment - **3.97%**\n* Electric Utilities - **3.40%**\n* Heavy Electrical Equipment - **3.17%**\n* Renewable Fuels - **2.76%**\n* Agricultural Chemicals - **2.17%**\n\nTop 10 Holdings: (Remember 4% cap)  JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. Sponsored ADR **3.85%,** NIO Inc. Sponsored ADR Class A **3.12%,** Lithium Americas Corp. **3.06%,** Daqo New Energy Corp. Sponsored ADR **3.02%,** SunPower Corporation **2.93%,** Livent Corporation **2.85%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **2.69%,** SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **2.68%,** Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. **2.61%,** Sociedad Quimica Y Minera De Chile S.A. Sponsored ADR Pfd Class B **2.49%.**\n\n# Takeaway/Final Thoughts:\n\nClean energy has a very bright future but the industry is still emerging. For this reason, market risk and price volatility may be higher than the broader market, and ETFs may be more favorable compared to individual stocks. \n\n**For those looking for a Clean Energy ETF that has more Global Exposure and is more diversified than ICLN, I would recommend checking out PBD - Invesco Global Clean Energy ETF.**   \n \n\nAs always thankyou for reading. This is not all inclusive so please do your own research to supplement, and if anyone else has any other great Clean Energy ETFs that they may prefer please comment! Have a good day everyone!",

They are a telecommunications and entertainment giant, with decent potential for forward growth with the rollout of their 5G network and expansion into streaming.\n\n**Why I believe they're undervalued:**\n\nBy nearly ever metric of share value, AT&amp;T is a \"cheap\" stock. Their P/E ratio is 11.21, compared to the industry average of \\~16 and their price to book ratio is 0.99 compared to competitor comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s 2.45. Most people buy AT&amp;T for the dividend, which now has a higher than historical average yield of 7.36% compared to their 5 year trailing average of 5.89.\n\nIt looks as though AT&amp;T wants to write-off or sell DTV, which would be a huge step in the way of modernizing the company. [They've also grandfathered DSL,](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/10/03/att-dsl-internet-digital-subscriber-line-outdated/5880219002/) a sign that they're admitting that running a legacy copper network costs them more than it makes.\n\n**Some issues and catalysts for it to fall further:**\n\nIf Biden is elected, Ajit Pai will definitely be kicked out of the FCC. No doubt about it. Telecom stocks will probably slide down a little more because their ~~briber~~ donations won't have as much effect on policy, and a democratic FCC will probably favor the consumer over big business.\n\nStarlink, in fact isn't as much of an issue some people think. Telecoms get most of their ROI in densely populated cities, where the price of building out infrastructure is low, and the amount that connect to it is high. They will, of course lose government subsidy to ~~legally fuc~~ expand broadband access to bumfuck nowhere, virginia, but those places are only profitable if the government heavily subsidizes them anyway. Starlink isn't viable in cities and their suburbs because of spectrum limitations, so much of their revenue is safe from it.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  It is not intended as legal, financial or investment advice and should not be construed or relied on as such. Before making any commitment of a legal or financial nature you should seek advice from a qualified and registered legal practitioner or financial or investment adviser.

      "selftext": "On **Monday** Shelby Tucker from RBC Capital maintained a buy rating on FirstEnergy $FE with a TP of $37 and follows a similar move by Morgan Stanley on October 5th with a TP of $39.\n\nThat allows 20% upside and looks reasonable given the stock was valued at $42 in July and $52 in February.\n\nThose valuations were before the Ohio Consumer Council asked the state's Public Utilities Commission to conduct an independent investigation of FirstEnergy, which federal authorities have tied to a $60M bribery scheme involving Ohio's former House Speaker. In its defense $FE has asserted that it acted ethically in its actions.\n\nHowever even assuming the worst the $6bn drop in market cap seems to exceed any likely downside.\n\n* $FE has not received any benefit from the alleged bribery (the relevant HB6 legislation does not come into effect until next year),\n* the overall impact of HB6 is not material for $FE (the stock did not move significantly when it was signed\n* the $6bn drop in market cap far exceeds the total $60M bribery\n* The $6bn drop in market cap far exceeds comparable cases (Exelon paid a $200M fine for bribery in Illinois in July)\n\nAll in all the valuation looks attractive with a trailing PE of 12 and forward dividend yield of 4.9%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn **Tuesday** Booking.com $BKNG set out nine travel related predictions based on research from more than 20,000 travellers across 28 countries with insights from proprietary search and endorsement data. Perhaps not surprisingly it was bullish about the outlook for travel with a significant majority of people said to be excited by the prospect of travelling again while over 30% said they wanted to travel more to make up for lost time.\n\nThat's exactly what Booking.com’s investors want to hear. The pandemic has clearly had a huge impact on the company. However, recently Booking has witnessed a recovery in its business. Newly booked room nights have steadily improved, from 15% of their normal level in April to 65% of their normal level in July.\n\nThe company has reinforced their liquidity with $10.5 billion of cash compared to $11.5 billion of debt and cash flow is almost neutral (usually +$5 billion). Consequently the company appears surefooted.\n\nThe valuation meanwhile is still down 20% from 2018 highs and trading on just 18x last years earnings. That looks cheap with strong balance sheet and the expected rebound in demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSemiconductor test equipment maker Teradyne $TER saw its shares surge 4.7% on **Wednesday** after the company delivered better-than-expected third-quarter results and guidance;\n\n* earnings rose 53% while sales climbed 41%\n* Q4 guidance is for an adjusted EPS $0.98 on sales of $710 million. Compared to consensus $0.50 on sales of $543.1 million\n\nTeradyne sells advanced testing equipment for chips (72%), wireless devices (5%) and electronic systems (14%). It also makes industrial automation equipment (9%), including collaborative and mobile robots.\n\nThe medium term outlook for testing is strong with the widespread roll out of 5G and suppressed demand expected to be released from Auto and Industry. Chief Executive Mark Jagiela said \"Entering Q4, market conditions in our test businesses are stronger than expected and we've positioned our production capacity to respond to potential short lead time demands as we move through the quarter.\"\n\nThe trailing PE of 23.55 looks attractive given the expected medium term outperformance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn **Thursday** Align jumped 35% after reporting knock out earnings as the CEO credited the “Zoom effect” for making people more aware of their crooked smiles. Revenue was up 21% and adjusted EPS came in at $2.25 compared to consensus of $0.64.\n\nIf true, that driver should apply to other dentistry companies such as SmileDirectClub which is expected to report earnings the week commencing November 10th. Both companies are growing quickly and share a huge total addressable market yet SDC is a valued at just 5x revenues compared to Align’s valuation that is closer to 15x.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn **Friday** shares of biotech start-up Compass Pathways $CMPS shot up 17% before settling back to close up 12% on the day after the chairman, co-founder, and chief executive officer (CEO) George Goldsmith appeared on CNBC to tell his company's story, causing the jump.  Specifically he discussed the company's approach to transforming mental healthcare, using psilocybin, the active ingredient in psychedelic, or \"magic\" mushrooms.\n\nThe company is currently in Phase 2b of its clinical trials, where the efficacy of the treatment is tested. Goldsmith also noted that the treatment has received breakthrough therapy designation from the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA), allowing it to expedite the development and review of the therapy. \n\nIn addition to the U.S., the UK-based company is doing clinical trials in eight other countries. The company expects to complete and report on its Phase 2b trials at the end of 2021, Goldsmith said in the interview. \n\nCompass initially plans to use its psilocybin therapy for patients with treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, addiction and other mental illnesses. The treatment combines the use of the psychoactive substance with trained therapist psychological support.\n\nWith 3.4 million sufferers, we get a $4 billion total addressable market if we assume 15% penetration and $8,000 cost.  Compass’ $1.3 billion market cap looks cheap in comparison.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, my favorite story this week.  On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne maintained a Hold rating on Liberty Broadband $LBRDK and set a price target of $174.00. That’s below the analyst consensus of a Moderate Buy with an average price target of $183.33 but enough above the current $140 to make it interesting.\n\nLiberty Broadband was created in September 2014 when Liberty Media spun off its cable businesses into a new unit. It was a typically complex arrangement by to avoid tax liabilities but the important part is that LBRDK ended up holding a 25% stake in Charter Communications $CHTR. Then, in May 2016, Charter acquired both Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, quadrupling the number of customers and becoming the second-largest cable company in the US after Comcast.\n\nCharter is now trading at around $592, so Liberty’s original investment is worth $35 billion. That is interesting because LBRDK’s other assets and liabilities are fairly trivial and the $35 billion asset offers a striking premium to the current market cap of $25 billion.\n\nImportantly there are a couple of catalysts here that should drive these two values together. The Liberty group is taking steps to simplify its structure with the merger of GCI Liberty and Liberty Broadband. That will reduce some overhead costs and allow cross shareholdings to be collapsed in a tax efficient manner. Secondly, LBRDK announced an expansion of its buyback program from $200 million to $1.2billion, citing the widening discount to NAV.\n\nThese measures may not be enough by themselves to drive these two values together but show that management is now addressing the issue. In the meantime shareholders get to hold a stake in Charter at a discount. Not bad given the $CHTR stock has performed well  (up 20% over 12 months) and could well have further to run. Cable is still one of the dominant / most efficient broadband technologies today and CHTR's management team is regarded as one of the most experienced teams in the cable industry. Additionally, the impact of COVID has been immaterial and the stock is up 10% since February.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Follow” me to get updates and links during the week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.

      "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 26th, 2020.\n\n# **There’s a big week ahead for the market with an earnings deluge, GDP data and stimulus negotiations  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/theres-a-big-week-ahead-for-the-market-with-an-earnings-deluge-gdp-data-and-stimulus-negotiations.html)**\n*****\n&gt; About a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings, including Apple and Microsoft, but uncertainty around stimulus and the presidential election could loom larger for markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There is also important economic data on the calendar, with a first look at third-quarter gross domestic product Thursday. After the second quarter’s shocking 31.4% decline following coronavirus shutdowns, the economy bounced back with growth of 32.5% expected in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly 170 companies report earnings in the coming week, with a diverse group of blue chips among them, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell, and Merck. There is also a big showing from large tech names. Microsoft reports Tuesday, and Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all report in a small window just after the market close on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; “For some of these stocks that have run a long way, the bar for those stock to respond to good earnings is higher,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivative strategy at BTIG.\n*****\n&gt; So far about 85% of S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings beat estimates, about 20 percentage points more than the long term average. Companies have been reporting earnings more than 16% above estimates, and the expectation is that earnings overall will be down about 18%, based on actual results and forecasts, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.95% for the week, breaking a 3-week win streak as coronavirus fiscal negotiations dragged on and tech shares declined.\n*****\n&gt; “We’ve offered compromises, the speaker on a number of issues is still dug in,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday. “If she wants to compromise, there will be a deal. But we’ve made lots of progress in lots of areas, but there’s still some significant areas that we’re working through.”\n*****\n&gt; His comments knocked stocks down a bit midday Friday.\n*****\n&gt; “It’s been a muted reaction to earnings overall,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. “So I’m disappointed, in a way, as a fundamentally focused chief investment officer, that the stimulus saga seems to be what it’s all about day in and day out, hour by hour. It’s the stimulus saga, the election looming and the Covid resurgence. Those three things have sort of made earnings a page four story.”\n*****\n&gt; With a week to go before the Nov. 3 election, the market could be a bit more volatile, especially if the outcome looks increasingly less certain.\n*****\n&gt; “The market is going to focus on the state of stimulus. It’s going to focus on whether the polls are tightening or widening with regard to the probability of having an unclear outcome, contested outcome or both,” said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Former vice president Joe Biden’s lead has narrowed slightly but he is still ahead in swing state polls.\n*****\n&gt; “We are experiencing a little bit of the calm before the storm here. I do think we are going to get some 1%, 2% daily moves depending on the news...I think you could see a 3% to 5% down opening the following day [after the election] pretty easily,” said Grohowski. “I think the market has grown increasingly comfortable with a cleaner result, even if the cleaner result is an all blue result, which potentially would result in a higher tax regime.”\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market began to focus more on the possibility of a Democratic sweep, where Democrats take the White House and Congress. That could mean a bigger stimulus package, and some strategists believe tax hikes would be delayed until the economy is on more solid ground.\n*****\n&gt; “As we get closer to the election, we’re likely to see more volatility no matter what the outcome,” said Grohowski.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said investors are not adequately hedged for an uncertain outcome. “Active managers have the most net long positions they’ve had in a number of years because they’re fearful of missing a year-end rally,” said Emanuel. “The options market in no way, shape or form is telling you people are hedged right here. The market is discounting a slight volatility, not expected to be persistent into year end.”\n*****\nEmanuel said the options market indicates investors do expect some volatility but not through year end, as some investors began hedging for several months ago.\n*****\n&gt; “What we see by and large is again the bump in volatility. It’s really only anticipating a 2% or 3% move in the market either way, after the election, and then the expectation is to likely moderate after that,” Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; The final trading day of October is on Friday, so there could also be some added volatility as fund managers readjust their portfolios between bonds and stocks. In the past week, Treasury yields broke out of a four-month range. The 10-year yield rose above 0.80% for the first time since June, and while it could move higher, strategists expect its move to be contained.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/67jHHD1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/M13Rd10.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ROEcV0O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zqElHD7.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9iotJBk.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lrNGV86.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xGvBBYL.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tR0QKgZ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iXkAMua.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/80umQkP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4BQenwD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rZFBz4D.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq vs. Dow Outperformance\n\n&gt; You may not realize it, but while the Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up a ridiculous 28% so far in 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still in the red on the year.\n\n&gt; Below is a table showing the Dow and Nasdaq's annual percentage change since 1972 when the Nasdaq came into existence. Were the year to end now, the Nasdaq would be outperforming the Dow by 28.65 percentage points. This would be the third strongest outperformance for the Nasdaq on record and the strongest since 1999 when the spread was 60 percentage points!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/dowavg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/downazpctchg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/spreaduse.png))**\n\n&gt; Below are all years since 1972 in which the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by at least ten percentage points. The Nasdaq has posted an annual gain of 20%+ in seventeen different years, but never in a year when the Dow was in the red. Probably the year that most resembles 2020 in terms of the performance spread is 1979 when the Nasdaq rose 28.11% and the Dow rose just 4.19%. Following that year in 1980, both the Dow and Nasdaq surged again and the Nasdaq outperformed by another 18.9 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Interestingly, of the twelve years where the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by more than ten percentage points, the Nasdaq went on to beat the Dow again in the next year eleven out of twelve times. The only time we've seen the Nasdaq crumble versus the Dow in the following year was in 2000 after 1999's outperformance. In 1999, the Nasdaq beat the Dow by a humongous 60 percentage points. After that large gap, though, the Nasdaq ran out of gas in 2000 and underperformed the Dow by 33 percentage points when the Dot Com Bubble finally burst.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/outperfo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Show Slowing Pace of Economic Recovery\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve’s (Fed) Beige Book presented qualitative data that suggested the pace of the economic recovery had been tapering, as we discussed in the LPL Research blog, Beige Book Shows Pace of Recovery is Moderating, but now we have quantitative data that is confirming the survey data. The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) increased 0.7% month over month in September to beat Bloomberg consensus expectations of 0.6%, but slowed after rising 1.4% in August and 2% in July.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the leading indicators are still growing, but at a slower rate than the blistering pace seen in the initial months after emerging from lockdowns.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.23.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Growth in the LEI in September was primarily driven by the improvement in jobless claims, as well as continued strength in building permits for new private housing—a trend that matches the behavioral shifts to accommodate work from home conditions during the pandemic. The pullback in stock prices last month and manufacturers’ new orders were the lone detractors from the LEI in September.\n\n&gt; “It comes as no surprise that growth began to level off after the surge over the summer, and the softer LEI print is suggesting the economy could be losing momentum heading into the fourth quarter,” said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “However, despite the slowing momentum, we still expect solid economic growth in Q4, just not quite at the same rate in Q3.”\n\n&gt; The decline in manufacturers’ new orders is likely in relation to election uncertainty, which should prove transitory. However, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in both Europe and the United States may cause business activity to slow, even if no additional lockdowns are mandated. As we head into the fourth quarter, we will continue to monitor real-time data for any additional clues about the pace of the economic recovery.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Halloween Trading Strategy: S&amp;P 500 Up 85% of the Time\n\n&gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 26 years. From the tables above &amp; below:\n\n&gt; * Dow up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.05%.\n&gt; * S&amp;P up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.11%.\n&gt; * NASDAQ up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.67%.\n&gt; * Russell 2000 up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.31%.\n\n&gt; Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course “Sell in May”. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac that most of the market’s gains have been made from October 31 to April 30, while the market tends to go sideways to down from May through October.\n\n&gt; Recent market weakness has held off our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal so far, but it could trigger anytime now. Uncertainty abounds with surging covid-19 cases, a heated presidential election and persistently elevated unemployment. However, each day that passes is one day closer to a covid-19 vaccine. Interest rates are low and ample liquidity is available to support the market and the economy. Additional fiscal stimulus also appears to be coming soon. Debate continues on the amount, but both parties do appear to agree it is needed in one form or another.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/79a067fc10d5ee40688ccec4ecb3fe2d/5899f7da34b8b8c0-e3/s500x750/4b0222300348a79e152bf80a85a41faf34984e3e.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/120a6a895b102be90ac05d6d5cbcdf2a/5899f7da34b8b8c0-26/s500x750/94df00168310f90a644b7aaa6f94820f807a4080.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/545ec0f231cb05daf30bc162745dc559/5899f7da34b8b8c0-25/s500x750/d84cab3903b5c92e70d470a07c469e2d646d38b8.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a59dd0402f777bcb3f8fd3fb014a35ed/5899f7da34b8b8c0-82/s500x750/f54029e610ed2abc990f8b7c6ea9678925bc0a5a.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # \"Quitters\"\n\n&gt; Like an old pair of \"quitters\" that keep falling down because their elasticity is shot, the market has had its own trouble staying up over the last few trading days. Today isn't over yet, but if the S&amp;P 500 finishes around current levels it will mark the fourth straight day of finishing down at least half of one percent from its intraday high. Compared to the three days before, today's pullback from an intraday high has actually been pretty mild up to this point. Following Monday's 2%+ decline from the intraday high shortly after the open, yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 traded down close to 1% from its afternoon high. These two reversals followed Friday's late-day sell-off when the S&amp;P 500 finished the day down 0.75% from its intraday high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Last-Four-Days1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it's disheartening to see the market erasing early gains as the day goes on, it's helpful to put the last four trading days into perspective. Over the last 25 years, it hasn't been uncommon for the S&amp;P 500 to finish the day down at least 0.5% from an intraday high for four days in a row. The current streak, if it holds, would be the 158th such streak of four or more days. That works out to more than six a year. There have also been a number of streaks that were much longer than the current one. In fact, it was only a month ago that the S&amp;P 500 went 11 straight days of finishing the day down at least 0.5% from its intraday high, and besides that streak, there have been five other streaks that spanned ten or more trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Streaks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # October Optimism For Homebuilders\n\n&gt; Given housing inventories remain historically low thanks to still strong demand, homebuilders have plenty to be optimistic about. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has continued to show this strength as its monthly sentiment survey set a record high for the month of October. Back in August, the index tied the previous record level of 78 from December of 1998. Over the past two months, it has only raised that bar, coming in at 85 this month; 2 points above forecasts and last month's reading of 83.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The rise in the index comes on broad strength across each of the sub-indices. Present Sales, Future Sales, and Traffic all matched or made record highs in October. The only sub-index that was not higher was for Traffic, though, it was unchanged at a record high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Table1.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the look across each of the four US regions, the West and Northeast both saw sizeable upticks to new records, but sentiment in the Midwest and South were actually slightly lower. For the Northeast, this is the third record in a row. Meanwhile, the West's record high in October finally surpassed the prior high of 91 from October of 2005. Finally, even though sentiment fell in the Midwest and South, both remain at higher levels now than any month other than September's record highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Regions.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 23rd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.25.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$TWLO** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$FSLY** \n&gt; * **$PINS** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$MRNA** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$ETSY** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$LGND** \n&gt; * **$FVRR** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$RTX** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$OSTK** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$ATVI** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$SHW** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$NVS** \n&gt; * **$NRZ** \n&gt; * **$MRK**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8wcVG2D.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.26.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AaPzlgn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9GgF3Hb.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rwj1IS3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/k4Rx5gI.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YjH86d9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LUzqajk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/NcPneVZ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/AMyjDf6.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/312QBRU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/mjgt9Gs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZJ4Y4Vk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3pFmMuz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SZg9uyc.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IGm07VC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IRNiQEm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SLRmoZE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.30.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7OhLjkG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Apple, Inc. $115.04\n**Apple, Inc.

MGM declined to comment on any talks, but said the film “is not for sale.”\n\nNabbing the rights to “No Time to Die,” would have been a major coup for a streaming service and could have helped entice subscribers looking to watch the latest Bond movie. The Daniel Craig film, which cost about $250 million to produce, would be the most notable movie to switch to streaming due to the pandemic, though other films have taken a similar route.",

      "selftext": "#  Introduction:\n\n “The only thing certain about oil is uncertainty.” - Dr. Subroto, then Secretary-General of OPEC. \n\nAfter the clean energy post there were some asking about oil/traditional energy. So this post will focus only on the energy ETF: XLE. Also, XOP and USO will be briefly discussed at then end. Individual holdings will not be discussed, this will be left up to individual research. **Let it be said upfront - Unless you have very high risk tolerance this market sector should be avoided!**\n\nFor most normal investments it is always important to keep a long-term window on your mind, however in this case, with cleaner energy sources poised to slowly replace traditional energy, it would be wise to be mindful about the potential gradual decline of these ETFs/market sector. With this being said however, oil forecasters (just like market forecasters) have been so wrong so many times in the past 30 years. Whenever it is predicted that oil will do one thing, it does the opposite. \n\nAs the world transitions to cleaner resources many countries will continue to lean heavily on oil/natural gas to bridge over. Interestingly, Germany actually increased their consumption of traditional energy sources as they have gradually weaned off their nuclear power plants in their plans to transition to greener sources (What do you guys think about nuclear power as a clean resource?). This bridge period will keep these sources relevant for some years to come. \n\nAdditionally there are many other factors than will affect the prices in the future, such as: wars, internal OPEC conflicts, an increased number of drivers in developing nations, an increased need for cheaper energy in developing nations, the use of oil in many products and services still, a rise in air travel (especially after COVID), etc. There are many reasons that oil/coal/natural gas will/won't remain relevant. (If anyone has any additional insight or an interesting note please let us know! I don't want this to be too long here)\n\nAlrighty so...\n\n# XLE: Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund \n\nLet's break down what XLE aims to do and it's holdings. XLE tracks a market-cap-weighted index of the S&amp;P500, because of this it is only composed of US companies. Its primary aim is to  provide high liquid exposure to the US  giants of the oil and gas industries. The holdings consist of many companies we are all familiar with, examples:  Chevron,  Exxon Mobil, Conoco,  Phillips 66, Valero, and so on. Currently it has 27 holdings. \n\nTop sectors:\n\n* Oil &amp; Gas Refining and Marketing - **59.10%**\n* Oil &amp; Gas Exploration and Production - **20.55%**\n* Oil &amp; Gas Transportation Services - **10.79%**\n* Oil Related Services and Equipment - **9.57%**\n\nCurrently numbers for XLE:\n\n* Current Price - $30.54\n* 52-Week High - $62.44\n* 52-week Low - $22.88 \n\nLike everything else, XLE dropped to lows in March, rallied to the mid-40s by mid-summer and has been falling since. However, at this point, the average volume is on a decline, this indicates that the number of sellers might be lower, this could lead to price stabilization around the \\~$30 mark. Here is where investors with a high risk tolerance could consider buying in. The assumption (refer to the quote up top) here is that oil and gas demand will pick up next year. According to some estimates the world demand for oil next year will increase, however, a reverse side to this are predictions for second infection wave that slows the economic recovery. Again, if you do not like volatility then do not consider this position. \n\n**A note about the dividend yield:** Yes, XLE does have a high dividend yield at 7%, however, the payout amounts have fluctuated greatly. This is a given considering the fact that oil went negative in April. Due to this ETF's heavy concentration in one particular sector and the given volatility, it might be better to look elsewhere for a stable high dividend yield if that is your interest. \n\n# A Note about the Individual Companies:\n\nThe majority of this is being left to individual research. This post would be too long to talk about all the players. A noteworthy mention though is that many of these large oil and gas companies are not blind about the eventual decline of oil and gas (a time window for this decline is obv up to speculation), and many are trying to reinvent themselves or reposition themselves to enter into the green markets (or other markets) to maintain relevance. Just some thought juice. \n\n# A Note about XOP and USO:\n\nXOP is often compared to XLE, please note the difference:  XOP provides an equal-weight approach to oil/gas exploration &amp; production. Due to this the fund has higher exposure to  the number of small- and midcaps increasing it's volatility. It is also very heavily weighted towards Exploration and Crude. This ETF is more affected by crude oil futures and has been hit partiularly hard due to its small and mid caps not being able to weather COVID and negative oil. \n\nUSO is an ETF that is designed to track the daily price movements of West Texas Intermediate. If you compare the 5 year price of oil to the 5 year price of USO you can see how USO drastically underperforms against its benchmark. Additionally, this ETF deals heavily in futures contracts, which normally isn't an issue unless the price for whatever they bought crashes (Like oil did in April). So in the short term they are hemorrhaging money and then having to reinvest back in at higher prices. The main takeaway from this would be - If you want exposure to Oil/Crude Oil, XLE, XOP, or just energy stocks might be a better option. \n\n# Takeaway/Final Thoughts:\n\nThis post I am sure will be controversial. So again, this cannot be stressed enough, unless you have high risk tolerance or a positive outlook for Oil and Gas, avoid these funds/market sector. If anyone has any constructive arguments for or against oil/gas, please comment! It is always great to hear about everyone's perspective, especially if they are well versed in the particular industry. \n\nAdditionally guys, I am just a dude that likes investing, researching, and sharing ETFs and Stocks, I do hold very small positions in XLE just because I believe there may be some positive swings in the future, but that is just my personal opinion. Point is - PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH, especially since I am not an advisor and this is certainly not holistic, there is a lot going on behind the scenes for oil and gas. Subsidies, taxes, regulations and all that weren't even mentioned buy they absolutely have their implications. And, as always thankyou for reading. Have a good day everyone!",

No Problem.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-revenue-no-problem-wall-street-rushes-into-electric-car-and-truck-startups-11603286077)\n\nExcerpt:\n\n&gt; A frenzy has hit the sector. Buoyed by the surge in the stock price of electric-vehicle pioneer Tesla Inc. and a rush of blank-check companies that take startups public, investors are hoping to find the future titans of an auto market transformed by a shift away from the internal-combustion engine.\n\nAlso:\n\n&gt; Backers of the electric-vehicle companies say the forthcoming electric era of autos has opened the door for a host of new competitors and brands. Regulations in some countries and California requiring more electric vehicles are creating a whole market, investors say, and they are betting the giant auto makers will be unable to pivot fast enough to compete.\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt; [Blake Denton] learned about Hyliion, which plans to mass produce electric drivetrains for semi-trucks, while looking through posts on the online message board Reddit. The company announced a deal to go public in June by merging with a [reverse merger company] and buzz began to grow online, with some thinking it could be the next Nikola.\n\n&gt; “I had invested in Hyliion on pure hype—literally pure hype,” Mr. Denton said. “I knew nothing about the company.”\n\n&gt; He said he sold after the price went up and made about $50,000.",

      "selftext": "# Introduction:\n\n“The only thing certain about oil is uncertainty.” - Dr. Subroto, then Secretary-General of OPEC.\n\nAfter the clean energy post there were some asking about oil/traditional energy. This post will probably be more controversial, but here are still many out there that believe oil/gas will continue to have a future.\n\nSo this post will focus only on the energy ETF: XLE. Also, XOP and USO will be briefly discussed at then end. Individual holdings will not be discussed, this will be left up to individual research. **Let it be said upfront - Unless you have very high risk and volatility tolerance this market sector should be avoided!**\n\nFor most normal investments it is always important to keep a long-term window on your mind, however in this case, with cleaner energy sources poised to slowly replace traditional energy, it would be wise to be mindful about the potential gradual decline of these ETFs/market sector. With this being said however, oil forecasters (just like market forecasters) have been so wrong so many times in the past 30 years. Whenever it is predicted that oil will do one thing, it does the opposite.\n\nAs the world transitions to cleaner resources many countries will continue to lean heavily on oil/natural gas to bridge over. Interestingly, Germany actually increased their consumption of traditional energy sources as they have gradually weaned off their nuclear power plants in their plans to transition to greener sources (What do you guys think about nuclear power as a clean resource?). This bridge period will keep these sources relevant for some years to come.\n\nAdditionally there are many other factors than will affect the prices in the future, such as: wars, internal OPEC conflicts, an increased number of drivers in developing nations, an increased need for cheaper energy in developing nations, the use of oil in many products and services still, a rise in air travel (especially after COVID), etc. There are many reasons that oil/coal/natural gas will/won't remain relevant. (If anyone has any additional insight or an interesting note please let us know! I don't want this to be too long here)\n\nAlrighty so...\n\n# XLE: Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund\n\nLet's break down what XLE aims to do and it's holdings. XLE tracks a market-cap-weighted index of the S&amp;P500, because of this it is only composed of US companies. Its primary aim is to provide high liquid exposure to the US giants of the oil and gas industries. The holdings consist of many companies we are all familiar with, examples: Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Conoco, Phillips 66, Valero, and so on. Currently it has 27 holdings.\n\nTop sectors:\n\n* Oil &amp; Gas Refining and Marketing - **59.10%**\n* Oil &amp; Gas Exploration and Production - **20.55%**\n* Oil &amp; Gas Transportation Services - **10.79%**\n* Oil Related Services and Equipment - **9.57%**\n\nCurrently numbers for XLE:\n\n* Current Price - $30.54\n* 52-Week High - $62.44\n* 52-week Low - $22.88\n\nLike everything else, XLE dropped to lows in March, rallied to the mid-40s by mid-summer and has been falling since. However, at this point, the average volume is on a decline, this indicates that the number of sellers might be lower, this could lead to price stabilization around the \\~$30 mark. Here is where investors with a high risk tolerance could consider buying in. The assumption (refer to the quote up top) here is that oil and gas demand will pick up next year. According to some estimates the world demand for oil next year will increase, however, a reverse side to this are predictions for second infection wave that slows the economic recovery. Again, if you do not like volatility then do not consider this position.\n\n**A note about the dividend yield:** Yes, XLE does have a high dividend yield at 7%, however, the payout amounts have fluctuated greatly. This is a given considering the fact that oil went negative in April. Due to this ETF's heavy concentration in one particular sector and the given volatility, it might be better to look elsewhere for a stable high dividend yield if that is your interest.\n\n# A Note about the Individual Companies:\n\nThe majority of this is being left to individual research. This post would be too long to talk about all the players. A noteworthy mention though is that many of these large oil and gas companies are not blind about the eventual decline of oil and gas (a time window for this decline is obv up to speculation), and many are trying to reinvent themselves or reposition themselves to enter into the green markets (or other markets) to maintain relevance. Just some thought juice.\n\n# A Note about XOP and USO:\n\nXOP is often compared to XLE, please note the difference: XOP provides an equal-weight approach to oil/gas exploration &amp; production. Due to this the fund has higher exposure to the number of small- and midcaps increasing it's volatility. It is also very heavily weighted towards Exploration and Crude. This ETF is more affected by crude oil futures and has been hit partiularly hard due to its small and mid caps not being able to weather COVID and negative oil.\n\nUSO is an ETF that is designed to track the daily price movements of West Texas Intermediate. If you compare the 5 year price of oil to the 5 year price of USO you can see how USO drastically underperforms against its benchmark. Additionally, this ETF deals heavily in futures contracts, which normally isn't an issue unless the price for whatever they bought crashes (Like oil did in April). So in the short term they are hemorrhaging money and then having to reinvest back in at higher prices. The main takeaway from this would be - If you want exposure to Oil/Crude Oil, XLE, XOP, or just energy stocks might be a better option.\n\n# Takeaway/Final Thoughts:\n\nThis post I am sure will be controversial. So again, this cannot be stressed enough, unless you have high risk tolerance or a positive outlook for Oil and Gas, avoid these funds/market sector. If anyone has any constructive arguments for or against oil/gas, please comment! It is always great to hear about everyone's perspective, especially if they are well versed in the particular industry.\n\nAdditionally guys, I am just a dude that likes investing, researching, and sharing ETFs and Stocks, I do hold very small positions in XLE just because I believe there may be some positive swings in the future, but that is just my personal opinion. Point is - PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH, especially since I am not an advisor and this is certainly not holistic, there is a lot going on behind the scenes for oil and gas. Subsidies, taxes, regulations and all that weren't even mentioned buy they absolutely have their implications. And, as always thankyou for reading. Have a good day everyone!",

Lennox (Service Experts, Allies Air Enterprises). \n\n5. Johnson Controls (Hitachi, York)\n\n**Understanding the HVAC market.**\n\nBefore we continue to further analyze the companies, we first need to understand the HVAC market.\n\nSome facts: \n\n1. The HVAC business has been valued at $91.30B in 2020 and is expected to reach $173B by 2024 and $367B by 2030. That’s a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of +/-15%. \n\n2. The most popular countries for Air Conditioning (AC) per household are: Japan 91%, USA 90%, Korea 86%, Saudi Arabia 53%, China 60%. \n\n3. Global stock of AC is expected to grow to 5.6B by 2050, up from 1.6B in 2018. (This is 1 AC sold every second for the next 30 years).\n\n4. Less than a third of the global households own an AC.\n\n5. 8% of the 2.8B people living in the hottest parts of the world own an AC (Brazil, Indonesia, India, African countries).\n\n6. AC demand is increasing every year going from 97,60M in 2012, up 111M in 2018.\n\nAs can been seen in the above statements the HVAC business is very well integrated in some large countries. But the most exciting prospects are those of the developing countries. In Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and India only 16%, 16%, 9%, 6% and 5% respectively of the households have AC. This is a MASSIVE market just waiting to be exploited.\n\n\\- The Indian AC market stood at $4,3B in 2017 and is expected to surpass 11B by 2023, that’s a CAGR of over 17%. This rising growth is led by rising infrastructure development, growing demand for housing and the constantly rising temperatures and consumers purchasing power.\n\n\\- The Middle Eastern and African market is expected to have an CAGR of 4,9% during 2019-2024.\n\n\\- The Indonesian market is currently experiencing a 2% CAGR in AC demand over 2012 till 2018.\n\n\\- The US is expected to have a CAGR of 3.1% from 2020 to 2030.\n\n\\- Europe is expected to have a CAGR of 6% from 2019 to 2025.\n\n\\- **The global HVAC market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 5.5% from 2018 till 2024**.\n\n**Market share.**\n\nThis was actually really really difficult to find free sources on and I can’t really make a clear picture out of it so here are the numbers:\n\n\\- 2013 North America market: Carrier 17%, Daikin 15%, Trane 10%, Johnson 9%, Lennox 6%, LG 5%.\n\n\\- 2013 Global AC market: Daikin 13%, Carrier 10%, Johnson 8%, Trane/LG 4%.\n\n\\- 2018 Indian market share: LG 17,7%, Hitachi 7,9%, Daikin 7,4%.\n\n\\- HVAC Used by construction firms in USA: Carrier 29%, Lennox 17,3%, Daikin 8,2%, Trane7,3%, LG 1,8% Johnson 1,8%.\n\n\\- 2020 global “Wall-Mounted Fan Coil Units” market: Daikin 29%, Trane 26%, Carrier 12%, Johnson 7,5%\n\nMy conclusion from this and other information found online is that globally Daikin is the biggest followed by Carrier, Johnson, Trane, LG and Lennox.

Also, Johnson had some fuckery going on in all their 10k’s so these numbers might not add up, let me know if you found something.\n\nLooking at the company’s financials and numbers it’s a tough decision to make, all companies a pretty close to each other. There are however some things that stand out:\n\n\\- Carrier has a significantly higher NPM then the competitors.\n\n\\- Lennox might be in financial trouble.\n\n\\- Daikin spends the most on R&amp;D relative to its revenue, I see this as a big plus.\n\n\\- Johnson their revenue is growing the fastest on a 5Y CAGR.\n\n\\- Johnson their P/E is much higher than the competition.\n\n\\- Johnson their Dividend is the higher % wise\n\n\\- Daikin has increased sales in 2020 while other companies have seen a drop.\n\n\\- Daikin’s NPM is stable at around 8% while Carrier’s NPM has grown explosively. \n\n\\- Trane has a high debt/equity ratio\n\n\\- Both Carrier and Daikin have a very strong Interest coverage ratio.\n\n\\- Johnson's TTM would be better without an irregular expense of 602M\n\nNow on to the less financial aspect of the data.\n\nI really like the way Daikin presents their annual report, they have clear strategies on how to better engage the Indian market. They are also showing that they know where their market growth protentional lays and are willing to act on it. Furthermore, what really strikes me as interesting is that Daikin produces materials for semiconductor testing, this might be a goldmine in the upcoming tech revolution and Daikin has shown to be well aware of this upcoming trend. Carrier on the other hand has not properly breached the Asian/Middle eastern market yet, they have stated to expand their geographical presence but I have found no conclusive strategies in how to do so. What is impressive about carrier is their high net profit margin and willingness to act on a more digital environment, an area where Daikin is currently lacking.\n\nTo conclude this research properly, if I had to choose a company right now, I’d being going for Daikin. Their well-presented data and goals for emerging markets, combined with their semiconductor products make me believe they are most suited for rapid growth. Their geographical location also puts them in a better position for Asian dominance. And their Goodman sub brand is well known in America and a direct competitor to Carrier. Carrier is a close second, with impressive brand recognition and attractive financials. One thing carrier does well that Daikin does not is transport refrigeration. In my opinion trucking is going to play a much larger role when self-driving trucks start to appear.",

This rising growth is led by rising infrastructure development, growing demand for housing and the constantly rising temperatures and consumers purchasing power.\n\n\\- The Middle Eastern and African market is expected to have an CAGR of 4,9% during 2019-2024.\n\n\\- The Indonesian market is currently experiencing a 2% CAGR in AC demand over 2012 till 2018.\n\n\\- The US is expected to have a CAGR of 3.1% from 2020 to 2030.\n\n\\- Europe is expected to have a CAGR of 6% from 2019 to 2025.\n\n\\- **The global HVAC market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 5.5% from 2018 till 2024**.\n\n**Market share.**\n\nThis was actually really really difficult to find free sources on and I can’t really make a clear picture out of it so here are the numbers:\n\n\\- 2013 North America market: Carrier 17%, Daikin 15%, Trane 10%, Johnson 9%, Lennox 6%, LG 5%.\n\n\\- 2013 Global AC market: Daikin 13%, Carrier 10%, Johnson 8%, Trane/LG 4%.\n\n\\- 2018 Indian market share: LG 17,7%, Hitachi 7,9%, Daikin 7,4%.\n\n\\- HVAC Used by construction firms in USA: Carrier 29%, Lennox 17,3%, Daikin 8,2%, Trane7,3%, LG 1,8% Johnson 1,8%.\n\n\\- 2020 global “Wall-Mounted Fan Coil Units” market: Daikin 29%, Trane 26%, Carrier 12%, Johnson 7,5%\n\nMy conclusion from this and other information found online is that globally Daikin is the biggest followed by Carrier, Johnson, Trane, LG and Lennox. I accounted for all known acquisitions since 2013 in the market share.\n\n**An introduction to the Companies**\n\n**Carrier**\n\nCarrier products and related services include HVAC and refrigeration systems, building controls and automation, fire and special hazard suppression systems and equipment, security monitoring and rapid response systems, provided to a diversified international customer base principally in the industrial, commercial and residential property and commercial transportation sectors.\n\nEmployees: 53,000+\n\nCountries active: 160+\n\nMarket Cap: 25,959B\n\n**Key points:**\n\n\\- 85% of sales are in the USA or Europe, they are however planning to expand globally.\n\n\\- 51% HVAC, 29% Fire and Security, 20% Refrigeration.\n\n\\- Since April 2020 carrier has split off from Raytheon Technologies, allowing them to focus fully on the HVACR market.\n\n\\- Carrier is planning on cutting 600million in costs by 2022 (4% of current COGS)\n\n\\- Carrier has recently launched its “BlueEdge” platform, providing aftermarket service to customers and minimizing machinery downtime &amp; costs.

Also, Johnson had some fuckery going on in all their 10k’s so these numbers might not add up, let me know if you found something.\n\nLooking at the company’s financials and numbers it’s a tough decision to make, all companies a pretty close to each other. There are however some things that stand out:\n\n\\- Carrier has a significantly higher NPM then the competitors.\n\n\\- Lennox might be in financial trouble.\n\n\\- Daikin spends the most on R&amp;D relative to its revenue, I see this as a big plus.\n\n\\- Johnson their revenue is growing the fastest on a 5Y CAGR.\n\n\\- Johnson their P/E is much higher than the competition.\n\n\\- Johnson their Dividend is the higher % wise\n\n\\- Daikin has increased sales in 2020 while other companies have seen a drop.\n\n\\- Daikin’s NPM is stable at around 8% while Carrier’s NPM has grown explosively. \n\n\\- Trane has a high debt/equity ratio\n\n\\- Both Carrier and Daikin have a very strong Interest coverage ratio.\n\n\\- Johnson's TTM would be better without an irregular expense of 602M\n\nNow on to the less financial aspect of the data.\n\nI really like the way Daikin presents their annual report, they have clear strategies on how to better engage the Indian market. They are also showing that they know where their market growth protentional lays and are willing to act on it. Furthermore, what really strikes me as interesting is that Daikin produces materials for semiconductor testing, this might be a goldmine in the upcoming tech revolution and Daikin has shown to be well aware of this upcoming trend. Carrier on the other hand has not properly breached the Asian/Middle eastern market yet, they have stated to expand their geographical presence but I have found no conclusive strategies in how to do so. What is impressive about carrier is their high net profit margin and willingness to act on a more digital environment, an area where Daikin is currently lacking.\n\nTo conclude this research properly, if I had to choose a company right now, I’d being going for Daikin. Their well-presented data and goals for emerging markets, combined with their semiconductor products make me believe they are most suited for rapid growth. Their geographical location also puts them in a better position for Asian dominance. And their Goodman sub brand is well known in America and a direct competitor to Carrier. Carrier is a close second, with impressive brand recognition and attractive financials. One thing carrier does well that Daikin does not is transport refrigeration. In my opinion trucking is going to play a much larger role when self-driving trucks start to appear.",

      "selftext": "I wanted to find a place that could either challenge me, or look further into this because I'm not an accountant by training. \n\nIn this [10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1681459/000168145920000103/fti-20200630.htm) the company explains on page 22 that their divisions, which operate in much the same way as each other with very slight variation, are all fairly valued against the market. They've depreciated goodwill down to zero on two divisions, and one division's goodwill is apparently still worth $2.5 billion. The company engineers crap, mostly for the oil and gas industry. The clients are the same companies in manufacturing/subsea/energies. Think Chevron, BP, Total, Exxon, Hess, etc. \n\nWhile the division that still has a goodwill value will likely see more work because it's both onshore production engineering and downstream refining engineering, I can't help but think the division should have taken a goodwill charge at some point during this market downturn. *They have the same clients.* On page 22, the company even states that the reasons for the goodwill impairment *\"included the COVID-19 pandemic breakout, commodity price declines, and a significant decrease in our market capitalization as well as those of our peers and customers\"*\n\nIf you look just at downstream customers of theirs, take Exxon, on page 9 of this [10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000003408820000073/xom10q2q2020.htm), they state that they've taken more than $800 million in goodwill impairment charges in reporting segments for *each of the reporting segments that are Technip Energies customers.* \n\nIf you look back to the [10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1681459/000168145920000083/technipfmc2020331-10q.htm) from immediately after the huge market cap decline in March, it's the same story. Goodwill is fully impaired on the two divisions not getting spun off, but apparently, even though there has been significant market cap decline as well as goodwill impairment charges for each and every one of the companies that would be Technip Energies' clients, no goodwill impairment. \n\nBut what do they have to gain from these unequal impairment charges? I don't know. The simplest explanation to me is that the company is going to be a separate entity *eventually* so maybe they're just too lazy to impair its goodwill? But they state in one of the 10-Qs that the company is recognized as in excess of its fair market value. So then the company is really worth its book value plus that goodwill? \n\nMaybe there are some tax advantages, and they reached their cap for the amount of goodwill impairment they're allowed to claim for the year? Hence tax fraud? Is there an accountant in the room?",

Also, because of revenue beats since the investor presentation, in order for TTCF to hit their estimated revenue for 2020 (148M) they would only need to have a pretty weak Q4.\n\nWith recent under-the-radar expansion into Target, publicity from the merger, and additional products hiting shelves I don’t see how that would be possible. \n\nWith that I’ve shown projected revenues/EBITDAs from the presentation and my own projected revenues/EBITDAs from what we know now. \n\nAlso, I used the fully diluted market cap of 1.5B for multiples. As you can see, when bears say TTCF is trading at extreme multiples, they are correct. However, TTCF also has extreme growth which is 11x-13x the industry average.\n\nMultiples are meaningless without factoring in growth. Q4 is, in my opinion what will change TTCF’s trajectory and turn heads given they beat the measly projection of 39M.\n\nCheers! \n\nPS @IdownlodedRobinhood (referenced in charts) is my StockTwits handle\n\n[Link to Charts](https://i.postimg.cc/rpTq4HGJ/8-F261266-010-B-405-A-928-A-1095069-C23-FF.jpg)",

      "selftext": "I made a small little post a few days ago on Clean Energy Index Funds. This one will focus on Specific Clean Energy ETFs. I hope this post helps people who are interested in this topic.  \n \n\nBefore we go in, I'd like to share some potential Megatrends on Clean Energy:\n\n1. 50% of the world’s energy is predicted to come from solar and wind by 2050, 7x the percentage in 2015.\n2. $2T is the total investment needed by 2030 to implement government renewable energy targets.\n3. Renewables are set to represent ¾ of the $12T the world invests in new power technology through 2040.\n\n(Source: [https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/product-brief/ishares-megatrends-global-clean-energy-etf-product-brief-en-us.pdf](https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/product-brief/ishares-megatrends-global-clean-energy-etf-product-brief-en-us.pdf))\n\nThe *current* general thesis for Clean Energy plays heavily with the concepts stated above along with others.\n\nOne note to address before we go in is that these funds are non-diversified: when you invest in these funds, you are SOLELY investing in Clean Energy. Do not confuse this with global diversification, these funds are very focused investments and they all have under 100 holdings\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**The ETFs**\n\nFirst Trust Global Wind NRG ETF (FAN) - This one has the lowest ER out of three standing at 0.62%. FAN contains about 30 holdings, the top 10 holdings account for about 54.09%. This ETF is very globally diversified, the top 3 countries are Denmark (19.23%), Canada (18.05%), and Spain (14.40%) standing. The US comes in 4th place standing at 10.40% for anyone interested. This ETF tracks the ISE Clean Edge Global Wind Energy Index which is Market-Cap Weighted. The ETFs weighting consists of 66.67% 'Pure-Plays' (companies that provide goods and services exclusively to the wind energy industry) and 40% 'Diversified Category' (companies that are determined to be significant participants in the wind energy industry despite not being exclusive to such industry). Overall, this ETF focuses on the CORE components of Wind Energy.\n\nFact Sheet: [https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=7ed74027-1285-4def-88ac-2ac152007d7b](https://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=7ed74027-1285-4def-88ac-2ac152007d7b)\n\nInvesco Solar ETF *(TAN)* \\- This one has the 2nd lowest ER out of the three standing at 0.71%. TAN contains about 27 holdings, the top 10 holdings account for about 63.62%. This ETF is globally diversified, the top 3 countries are The US (57.87%), Hong Kong (14.26%), and China (7.12%) This ETF tracks the MAC Global Solar NRG Index which is Market-Cap Weighted. Similar to FAN, this ETF also weighs itself through the concepts of 'Pure-Plays' (companies that provide goods and services exclusively to the solar energy industry) and 'Diversified Category' (companies that are determined to be significant participants in the solar energy industry despite not being exclusive to such industry), boosting weight for 'Pure-Plays' and underweighting 'Diversified Category.' Overall, this ETF focuses on the CORE components of Solar Energy.\n\nFact Sheet: [https://www.invesco.com/us-rest/contentdetail contentId=025d7c23dbd92610VgnVCM1000006e36b50aRCRD&amp;dnsName=us](https://www.invesco.com/us-rest/contentdetail?contentId=025d7c23dbd92610VgnVCM1000006e36b50aRCRD&amp;dnsName=us)\n\nGlobal X Lithium &amp; Battery Tech ETF *(LIT)* \\- This one has the highest ER out of the three standing at 0.75%. LIT contains about 43 holdings, the top 10 holdings account for about 59.91%. This ETF is globally diversified, the top 3 countries are, similar to TAN, China (30.94%), The US (24.12%), and Hong Kong (13.22%). A lot of Chinese weight, please research this carefully. China is still considered an Emerging Market so this is a very unique weighting situation. Anyways, this ETF tracks the Solactive Global Lithium Index which is Market-Cap Weighted. This ETF is unique because it focuses on the Full Lithium Cycle which means it offers exposure to the Metal/Mining, Lithium Refining, and Battery Production Segments. This ETF is similar in some ways to Commodity Metal ETFs, keep this in mind if you plan on going further with this.\n\nFact Sheet: [https://www.globalxetfs.com/content/files/LIT-factsheet.pdf](https://www.globalxetfs.com/content/files/LIT-factsheet.pdf) (This Fact Sheet is 3 months old, it's outdated. Seek out a website such as [ETF.Com](https://ETF.Com) for up to date information)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWhat I provided is very brief. If you're serious about Clean Energy, you must read each ETFs fact sheet along with the prospectuses. This will educate you on the field more and provide more crucial data for each fund.\n\nThe main difference between each of these ETFs really comes down to the underlying holdings, sector allocations, and global diversification. Analyze your Risk Tolerance and Circle Of Competence in terms of holding/sector/globality for each fund before making a decision.\n\n**Disclaimer:** *I am* ***NOT*** *a financial expert.

      "selftext": "An educated person is in touch with their past. Understanding what has gone before helps you deal with the present and face the future. A trader who keeps a journal can learn from the past instead of mindlessly repeating mistakes. A trading diary provides an isolated mirror, a valuable feedback loop. It is probably the single best learning tool avail-able to traders.   I can personally say that keeping a trading journal has been more valuable than anything else I have ever done.  \n\nA trading diary is both a visual and written record of your trades. You can keep it on paper or in electronic form. I started keeping mine such a long time ago that I still do it on paper I like being able to write down my ideas and evaluate mistakes on paper. \n\nWrite down the name of the stock, the date, and the number of shares bought or shorted. Add a note on the fundamentals if they had anything to do with that trade. Comment on how you first became aware of that stock for example tip from a friend, or an article in a magazine, research or a newsletter. This allows you to track the sources of your information. Use a pen to mark indicator signals and chart patterns that led you into that trade. Write a few words about your feelings entering that trade (anxious, happy, confident, unsure) and note any unusual factors and circumstances.\n\nI update my trading journal daily and even if I don’t trade, I take time to review my previous actions.  This discipline reminds me that trading is what I do, and trading takes priority over almost all other activities. I will Repeat this process after exiting a trade and Review the decisions I made good or bad.  Mark up trading signals and write down your comments on the circumstances of the exit, including your feelings about it.\n\nAs my journal has grown, the visual record of my trades have becomes more and more valuable. I recommend that you constantly look through your journal. How do those signals look now? What are you happy with, what would you have done differently, what lessons have you learned? Most traders never ask themselves these questions. When they make money, they swell with pride, and when they lose, they feel angry or ashamed. Wallowing in feelings will not make you a better trader. Our losses can teach us more than our gains. \n\nA trading journal helps you put aside self-kicking or self-congratulation and pay attention to the facts. It helps you learn and succeed, helps you become free. Nobody can give you a trading diary. You have to create it yourself, and your ability to maintain it will provide a running check of your discipline. Whenever you make some money, look through your journal and ask whether you could have done any past trades differently in light of what you have just learned. When you lose, do not kick your-self but write a good note on that trade, go back to review past trades, and think how to avoid such losses in the future. Learn from your profits and losses. \n\nBe sure to strictly observe money management rules so that a string of freak losses doesn’t toss you out of the game while you’re still learning. Follow the rules and a trading diary, review them, learn from them, and you’ll have everything it takes to become a successful trader.\n\nI have been trading successfully for 5+ years and the above information is one of the most important things I can share with you.",

The only reason they are down is because Westpac had to sell their share in the company as they made a deal with afterpay. There is literally no reason for zip to be losing, this is potentially the best news the company has ever released.

Also, because of revenue beats since the investor presentation, in order for TTCF to hit their estimated revenue for 2020 (148M) they would only need to have a pretty weak Q4.\n\nWith recent under-the-radar expansion into Target, publicity from the merger, and additional products hiting shelves I don’t see how that would be possible. \n\nWith that I’ve shown projected revenues/EBITDAs from the presentation and my own projected revenues/EBITDAs from what we know now. \n\nAlso, I used the fully diluted market cap of 1.5B for multiples. As you can see, when bears say TTCF is trading at extreme multiples, they are correct. However, TTCF also has extreme growth which is 11x-13x the industry average.\n\nMultiples are meaningless without factoring in growth. Q4 is, in my opinion what will change TTCF’s trajectory and turn heads given they beat the measly projection of 39M.\n\nCheers! \n\n\n[Link to Tables](https://i.postimg.cc/rpTq4HGJ/8-F261266-010-B-405-A-928-A-1095069-C23-FF.jpg)",

Considering amazons bussiness revolves around (not exclusively but significantly) ecommerce/retail, AWS and streaming, why would their EPS drop  \\~30% from the previous quarter? It just doesnt seem to add up. Their ecommerce has been running full capacity and is expanding to meet demands. Considering how Fedex smashed expectations, this should be an indicator of how ecommerce is still growing in pandemic. Did tech companies stop using AWS (zoom didnt)? Are people streaming less? All of these factors make it seem unreasonable for such a decrease in EPS.\n\nUPS: Q2 2.13 EPS and projected Q3 1.82 EPS. Decrease in EPS seems unreasonable for reasons mentioned above. FedEx smashed their estimates and EPS grew from an already high Q2 earnings. Parts of the world opened up their cities a little bit but parts of the world, especially Europe, are hit with second waves.\n\nShopify: Q2 0.43 EPS and projected Q3 EPS -0.08. Consensus estimate is not just decrease in EPS but a net loss. Even if earnings were to decrease, I dont see how they wouldnt profit from ecommerce demand and retailers forced to shift or create an online platform.\n\nI know there is more than just EPS that affects the perception of earnings report, but for the same reasons discussed, future demand and growth for these industry should have a positive outlook.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been doing a lot of personal studying of stock investing for the past couple weeks and feel as though I’m pretty much ready.  As of this moment, I’ll be getting my first pay check on Thursday giving 300 dollar to use.  I’m not afraid of a learning experience(a loss) and risking a smaller sum of money in order to try to capitalize on gains since I feel confident on what I want.  If you all think that it is a bad idea and want to give me some constructive criticism, I’m very open.  The stock I chose was Sony SNE because it is a company that I sort of understand and pay attention to, which I would say is important in the world of investing to know what you’re investing in.  Furthermore, I think gains are imminent due to their earnings report coming in 3 days as long as they are good.  As well as, the upcoming release of the PS5 in Nov and extended Christmas sales in Dec.  They’re at 75.43 and had 52 wk high at 84.14 some weeks ago, and with upcoming sales soon, I think the stock could jump back up to that number.  With more people indoors, at-home fun activities are in demand, so maybe people are more likely to buy.  Once again, feel free to correct me on my reasoning if this is leading me to a faulty conclusion.  I welcome tips and help.  To further my confidence in why the stock could shoot up, I looked at SNE stock during the release of the previous three Playstations.  The PS2 kinda got the raw end of the stick because it was released during the tech bubble burst.  I include it in my pics, but kinda disregard it validity in current trend.  The best sales years of the PlayStation consoles PS2, 3, 4 respectively are 2003, 2011, and 2016/17.  Their sales were 22.52, 14.3, and 20.  For my charts, I got them on macrotrends.net.\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/dgztmTb\n\nThe release and Christmas season for the PlayStation 3 did Sony alright with a 7% increase. It increased about three dollars in share price.\n\nThe PlayStation 4 spiked 10% for the Release but went down to around 2% during the Christmas season.  The SNE share went from 16 to 18 after release and then back down to 16.5.\n\nNow with this I expect the SNE share price to go up.  Maybe if earnings are good, and the release and Christmas season do well, the stock price could go up a fair bit.  Probably not ten dollars, but maybe close.  \n\nI want to make some money.  I don’t want to buy three shares of 75$ SNE and sell it while it’s a couple dollars more and make pennys.  I want to make some money.  I think I want to buy and 85$ strike call option at 1.78 premium with an exp of Jan 21, 2021, so I can get Christmas sales if it continues to look good, or if I’m already up a bit and I don’t expect Christmas to have a good effect on the share price, I could sell the option while it’s up a little.  It would need to go up 15.05%, which I highly doubt would happen.  The option is the last picture in the imgur album.  Tell me what you think of all this.  Is this a good first investment in the stock market?  Did I look at everything correctly?  I like criticism.",

      "selftext": "Microsoft ￼ reports September quarter results on Tuesday afternoon, and the story should continue to be a positive one for the software giant.\n\nStreet consensus calls for revenue of $35.7. billion, up 8.2%, with profits of $1.54 a share. In the June quarter, Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) posted revenue of $38 billion, up 13% from the year-ago quarter, crushing the Street consensus at $36.4 billion. Profits were $1.46 a share, ahead of the Street estimate at $1.38.\n\nMicrosoft provides guidance by business segment. For the September quarter, the company projects revenue for Productivity and Business Processes of $11.65 billion to $11.9 billion; Intelligent Cloud revenue of $12.55 billion to $12.8 billion; and More Personal Computing segment revenue of $10.95 billion to $11.35 billion. The company also has said that September quarter results will include a noncash benefit of $900 million due to an adjustment in the useful life of some hardware.\n\nStifel analyst Brad Reback writes in a research note that the company is likely to beat his own forecast, which calls for $35.6 billion in revenue and profits of $1.53 a share.\n\n“We expect upside to Street EPS and revenue forecasts, as we believe Microsoft’s various properties (Azure/Office365/PC) should continue to benefit from accelerated digital transformation due to the pandemic and a rebounding worldwide economy driving better-than-expected transactional revenue,” Reback writes. “We expect the strong results to set the stage for a solid 3Q earnings season for the broader software group.”\n\nReback also expects strong December quarter guidance, based on the same factors, plus Office 365 pricing and volume gains, Azure market share expansion, and the pending release of the new generation of Xbox consoles. “Given these dynamics and consistent capital return (&gt;$20 billion in annual buybacks and dividends), we remain buyers,” he writes. Reback recently upped his target on the stock to $245, from $220.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives likewise sees a strong quarter for the company’s Azure business. “This current work from home environment is further catalyzing more enterprises to make the strategic cloud shift with Microsoft across the board,” he writes.\n\nAdds Ives: “We continue to believe Microsoft is the core cloud name to play this transformational secular trend as well as for the other side of this dark valley.” He keeps his Outperform rating and $260 target price on Microsoft shares.\n\nCredit Suisse analyst Brad Zelnick, who has an Outperform rating on Microsoft shares, likewise expects a strong quarter, driven by Azure, Windows, and gaming. “Leverage to strong secular trends places Microsoft in a select group of companies that can deliver strong top-line and EPS growth as massive scale amidst an uncertain backdrop,” he writes. He keeps his $225 target price.\n\nSource: Barron's",

Ant could raise up to a maximum of about $5.2 billion more, if underwriters exercise their option to purchase up to 15% more shares in an arrangement known as a greenshoe.\n\nIn a few years, Ant has helped change how people in China spend, borrow, save and invest. The firm, which has its origins in an escrow service for Alibaba’s e-commerce websites, now processes trillions of dollars in payments annually, runs one of the world’s largest money-market funds, and facilitates small loans to hundreds of millions of consumers and small businesses. \n\nThe price values the Hangzhou-based group at about $313 billion, after including the new capital raised but before any greenshoe. In comparison, Mastercard Inc. was worth about $330 billion as of Friday’s close. A private fundraising in 2018 valued Ant at $150 billion.\n\nJack Ma, who controls Ant, said over the weekend the IPO will be “the largest in human history.” Speaking at a financial forum in Shanghai on Saturday, he said: “This is the first time that such a big IPO was priced outside of New York City, which we wouldn’t have dared to think about five, or even three years ago.”",

The purpose of this post is to share my findings on some of the technicals I use and highlight some of the reasons I think the stock will do well based on its fundamentals.  Please share your perspective, especially if you see things differently or have found something I overlooked.  There are a handful of items within their balance sheet that I don't like but I'm going to keep those to myself to see if anyone has an opinion.  What do you see?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts on the technicals:\n\n\\- Stock is trading near ATHs.\n\n\\- Bull flag pattern forming.  Looking at a 6-month chart, the pattern can be seen starting on 9/14.\n\n\\- Entering TTM Squeeze.  Upper and lower Bollinger Bands are inside the Keltner Channels.  TTM Squeeze indicator is red.\n\n\\- RSI is around 53.  These past 6-months, it hasn't gone much lower than this before starting a run up.\n\n\\- ADX indicator is telling me the current sideways trend is weak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts on the fundamentals:\n\n\\- Price/Sales ratio is 1.57 (The following are also medical technology companies but provide a different product than RCM.  Here are there respective Price/Sales ratio:  TDOC 24.40;  LVGO 53.45;  OTRK 22.88).\n\n \\- Revenue is growing and they are profitable\n\n\\- Current P/E is 167.75\n\n\\- Forward P/E is 30.34\n\n\\- EPS (ttm) is 0.10\n\n\\- EPS next year is 0.56\n\n\\- EPS next year is +382%\n\n\\- EPS next 5 years is +25%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope you will take a look through your own lens and let me know what you see.",

      "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nThe idea with this portfolio is that they are mostly actively managed and focus on goals rather then specific companies or industries. If, say, 3D modeling goes out of style in replacement of something more advanced, Ark Invest will adjust its products accordingly. Seeing how profitable each of these are it is incredibly unlikely they will be dissolved any time soon. With that in mind, these ETFs focus on many groundbreaking things that will inevitably become the cornerstones of our society by the time I retire in 2060. Currently, each of these products has outperformed the SPX thrice over with VCR having taken the lead at a 245% YTD return. CXSE takes last place with 43% return YTD but still outperforms SPX in the same time horizon. A key  advantage is that this portfolio taps heavily into foreign markets and has holdings comprised of securities on the Honk Kong exchange and other foreign markets (Most notably Tencent). There is diversity found both geographically and financially. I am keeping each at a weighting between 8 and 12 percent as to not overindulge into one specific security. Given the massive share price of VCR it can be difficult at times as one share equates to 10% of my current portfolio. \n\n\nMany of these ETFs are rebalanced quarterly and/or monthly by active managers. Vanguard's VCR fund is the only one that isn't actively managed but the inherent concept of its holdings keeps it on top.  \n\nMany of these ETFs have overlapping securities dominating their Top 10 holdings. Given that they are primarily growth ETFs this is expected. The biggest overlaps include Tencent, Alibaba, MercadoLibre, Twitter and Tesla. \n\n---\n\n* ARKG - ARK Genomic Revolution ETF is an actively-managed ETF that invests in companies across multiple sectors, including healthcare, information technology, materials, energy and consumer discretionary, that are relevant to genomics revolution.  \n\n---\n\n* VCR - Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF is an ETF that tracks the performance of the Morgan Stanley Capital International US Investable Market Consumer Discretionary Index.   \n\n---\n\n* KGRN - KraneShares MSCI China Environment Index ETF is an ETF that provides exposure to Chinese companies that focus on contributing to a more environmentally sustainable economy by making efficient use of scarce natural resources or by mitigating the impact of environmental degradation. \n\n---\n\n* ONLN - ProShares Online Retail ETF is an ETF that tracks the ProShares Online Retail Index. It invests in companies that principally sell online or through other non-store sales channels, such as through mobile or app purchases, rather than through \"brick and mortar\" store locations. \n\n---\n\n* EMQQ - The Emerging Markets Internet and Ecommerce ETF is an ETF that tracks the performance of the Emerging Markets Internet Index by targeting companies whose primary business is e-commerce or Internet-related activities that generate most of their revenues in emerging market countries. \n\n---\n\n* PBD - Invesco Global Clean Energy ETF is an ETF that tracks the WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation Index which holds globally listed equity securities engaged in the business of the advancement of clean, renewable energy and conservation. The Fund uses a multi-factor screening approach &amp; is rebalanced/reconstituted quarterly. \n\n---\n\n* IPO - Renaissance IPO ETF is an ETF that provides investors with efficient exposure to a portfolio of newly public companies prior to their inclusion in core U.S. equity portfolios. The ETF tracks the rules-based Renaissance IPO Index designed by leading IPO research firm Renaissance Capital. \n\n---\n\n* TAN - Invesco Solar ETF is an ETF that tracks the MAC Global Solar Energy Index which market cap weights securities in the solar energy industry including all solar technologies, the entire value chain (raw materials, manufacturing, installers, solar plant operations, financing), &amp; related solar equipment such as power inverters/encapsulates. \n\n---\n\n* ARKQ - ARK Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics ETF is an ETF comprised of companies relevant to the theme of industrial innovation. Companies are expected to focus on the development of new products and services, technological improvements, and advancements in scientific research related to multiple industries. \n\n---\n\n* CXSE - WisdomTree China ex-State-Owned Enterprises Fund is an exchange-traded fund incorporated in the USA. The Fund seeks to provide exposure to Chinese stocks where government ownership does not exceed 20% of outstanding shares.   \n\n---\n\n* GIGE - SoFi Gig Economy ETF is an exchange-traded fund incorporated in the USA. This ETF is an actively-managed exchange-traded fund that seeks to achieve its investment objective primarily by investing in a portfolio of companies listed around the world that Toroso Investments, LLC, the Fund's investment adviser, considers part of the \"gig economy\".",

      "selftext": "I understand the general idea of how taxes work with dividends and capital gains, but I was wondering how much of a difference this really amounts to and was hoping someone could provide some insight.\n\nHere's the logic that led to my question... If you hold a stock that pays dividends in a taxable account and you DRIP the dividends, then you are essentially treating this as a growth stock. The company pays out a dividend, but you'd rather keep it invested in the same company so you DRIP the dividend right back into your position. However, unlike a growth stock, the payment of the dividend is a taxable event, and the reinvestment (I'm assuming) creates a new \"tax lot\" with a new cost. Compared to a growth stock, not only are you paying that tax early, but you're also paying that tax as regular income tax at a higher rate (assuming ordinary dividends and you're in the 22% tax bracket).\n\nWith a growth stock that doesn't pay dividends, figuring out the taxes is pretty straightforward. For example, if you dumped $10k into said stock five years ago, never touched it again, then sold it today at $15k, you'd be taxed on a gain of $5k. The long-term capital gains rate for someone in the 22% bracket would be 15%, so you would owe 15% of $5k = $750.\n\nMy question is ultimately in this same scenario, if the stock \\*did\\* pay a dividend of say 2% (or whatever is easiest to use as a fairly realistic example), and that dividend got taxed as regular income over those five years and immediately reinvested, how much would be owed in taxes at the end of that five years (both the taxes already paid on the dividends throughout those years, plus the capital gains tax on the final sale)? What additional \"price\" do you pay to hold a dividend-paying stock as a result of the different tax treatment? I would assume it's pretty insignificant, but I suppose that's just a guess, so I was looking for some clarification.",

      "selftext": " **Q3** **2020** **Results** \n\n* Revenue was $2.80 billion, up 56 percent year-over-year and 45 percent quarter-over-quarter driven by higher revenue in both the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom and Computing and Graphics segments.\n* Gross margin was 44 percent, up 1 percentage point year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by EPYC™ and Ryzen™ processor sales. Gross margin was flat quarter-over-quarter as an increase of Ryzen and EPYC processor sales was offset by a higher percentage of semi-custom revenue.\n* Operating income was $449 million compared to $186 million a year ago and $173 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $525 million compared to $240 million a year ago and $233 million in the prior quarter. Operating income improvements were primarily driven by revenue growth, including an increase in Ryzen and EPYC processor sales and semi-custom product sales.\n* Net income was $390 million compared to $120 million a year ago and $157 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $501 million compared to $219 million a year ago and $216 million in the prior quarter.\n* Diluted earnings per share was $0.32 compared to $0.11 a year ago and $0.13 in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.41 compared to $0.18 a year ago and $0.18 in the prior quarter.\n* Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.77 billion at the end of the quarter.\n\n**Quarterly Financial Segment Summary**\n\n* Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.67 billion, up 31 percent year-over-year and 22 percent quarter-over-quarter. Revenue was higher year-over-year driven by a significant increase in Ryzen processor sales partially offset by lower graphics revenue. Revenue was higher quarter-over-quarter driven by a significant increase in Ryzen processor sales and an increase in graphics revenue.\n   * Client processor average selling price (ASP) was lower year-over-year due to a higher mix of mobile processor sales. Client processor ASP was higher quarter-over-quarter driven by higher desktop and mobile processor ASPs.\n   * GPU ASP was lower year-over-year due to product cycle timing and higher quarter-over-quarter due to product mix.\n   * Operating income was $384 million compared to $179 million a year ago and $200 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases were driven by higher Ryzen revenue.\n* Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $1.13 billion, up 116 percent year-over-year and 101 percent quarter-over-quarter. Revenue was higher year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to higher semi-custom product sales and increased EPYC processor sales.  \n   * Operating income was $141 million compared to $61 million a year ago and $33 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases were primarily driven by higher revenue.\n* All Other operating loss was $76 million compared to operating losses of $54 million a year ago and $60 million in the prior quarter.\n\n**Current Outlook**  \nAMD’s outlook statements are based on current expectations. The following statements are forward-looking, and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under “Cautionary Statement” below.  \n\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $3.0 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 41 percent year-over-year and 7 percent sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be primarily driven by the ramp of new Ryzen, EPYC and semi-custom products and growing customer momentum. AMD expects non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 45 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.  \n\n\nAMD now expects 2020 revenue to grow by approximately 41 percent compared to 2019, up from prior guidance of 32 percent.

Comes after stocks faced some pressure to start the week with S&amp;P on Monday suffering its biggest pullback in over a month. Growth beating value. Tech and consumer discretionary among the outperformers. Energy, industrials, and financials trailing. Treasuries firmer across the curve. Dollar weaker vs yen and euro. Gold up 0.1%. WTI crude up 0.5%, but off best levels, after falling more than 3% in prior session.\n* Nothing particularly incremental surrounding some of the higher-profile themes. Press continues to focus on **record average number of new coronavirus** cases in the US, along with increase in hospitalizations. **Earnings beat rates strong** but bar has moved higher in aggregate. **Stimulus deal looks increasingly unlikely before the election** given longstanding stumbling blocks. **Biden remains the front runner** with the election just a week away but there is **still a path for Trump to pull off another 2016 surprise**. Market would seemingly be fine with either scenario but **contested election** a risk.\n* **Busy earnings day**. Just over a third of the S&amp;P 500 has reported Q3 results. Beat rates remain very elevated but down a bit from Q2. Takeaways mixed and seem to be leaning more company specific with some of the higher-profile themes well understood. Recent strategist commentary has focused on how beats are not resonating with the market like they normally do, a function of a high bar and a bigger focus on issues such as the coronavirus, election and stimulus. **M&amp;A and strategic announcements** fairly well received.\n\n**Notable Gainers:**\n\n* \\+24.7% **HOG-US** (Harley-Davidson): Big Q3 revenue and EPS beat; shipments ahead and all segments beat expectations; lower provisions and tax rate helped; raised restructuring savings target and provided more detail on its market strategy and product portfolio reduction plans.\n* \\+17.8% **EXAS-US** (EXACT Sciences): Q3 EPS decline bigger than expected, but revenue beat, EBITDA posted surprise gain, GM ahead; to acquire Thrive Earlier Detection in $2.15B cash and stock deal, Base Genomics for $410M in cash; analysts positive on Thrive deal and price paid compared to ILMN-US GRAIL acquisition.\n* \\+9.1% **XLNX-US** (Xilinx): To be acquired by AMD-US in $35B in all-stock deal; $143 a share price a \\~27% premium to 8-Oct close, before first report companies were near a deal; expected to close by end of 2021.\n* \\+9.1% **FFIV-US** (F5 Networks): Fiscal Q4 revenue and EPS better; Dec Q guidance also ahead; Street positive on increased subscription contribution to software growth, muted coronavirus impact, initial guidance for FY21, leverage to 5G opportunity, and valuation; more cautious commentary revolved around structural pressures on core hardware business.\n* \\+8.8% **SSTK-US** (Shutterstock): Big Q3 earnings beat with revenue ahead of consensus; highlighted strong subscriber growth and progress of margin initiatives; noted improvement in revenue per customer and revenue per download.\n* \\+3.9% **BGS-US** (B&amp;G Foods): Acquiring Crisco brand from SJM-US for \\~$550M in cash with deal to close in Q4; company expects acquisition to be immediately accretive to EPS and FCF; sees unit benefiting from increased Covid-related demand.\n* \\+2.7% **AIG-US** (AIG): Announced plans to separate its Life &amp; Retirement business and focus on its P&amp;C General Insurance business; however, no details on separation path while Reuters said it could take a couple of years; also announced a number of executive changes; Peter Zaffino, the current President and Global COO, will replace current CEO Brian Duperreault, effective 1-Mar.\n* \\+2.5% **WAT-US** (Waters): Q3 organic growth, revenue and EPS beat; GM light; company highlighted a rebound in most markets and geographies; pharma and industrial the bright spots; Academic still soft but did show significant improvement; recurring revenues and instrument revenues both rebounded; Street waiting to hear more on strategy under new CEO.\n* \\+2.0% **CRM-US** (Salesforce.com): CEO Marc Benioff downplayed concerns about the read-throughs for his company and the broader software space from yesterday's guidance cut from SAP-US ; said SAP's troubles are \"unique to them,\" noting their CEO transition is just not proceeding smoothly and customers are saying that.\n\n**Notable Decliners:**\n\n* \\-12.1% **CHGG-US** (Chegg): Q3 earnings, revenue, subscriptions ahead with guidance raised; analysts noted high expectations as stock benefited from stay at home trend this year, gross margin guide missed; however subscriber growth and ARPU were strong due to international expansion, product adoption, and better monetization.\n* \\-5.7% **LLY-US** (Eli Lilly): NIH halted study of bamlanivimab in combination with GILD-US 's remdesivir on hospitalized Covid patients after finding no benefit; studies on earlier-stage patients will continue; Q3 earnings and revenue missed amid lower realized prices.\n* \\-5.6% **DXCM-US** (Dexcom): Preannounced Q3 revenues above consensus; however analysts underwhelmed by magnitude of beat vs past history and elevated expectations; COO/EVP Rick Doubleday announced his retirement.\n* \\-5.3% **ROP-US** (Roper Technologies): Q3 EPS and EBITDA better on largely in-line revenue performance; raised FY EPS guidance; however, Q3 organic growth declined a larger-than-expected 3%, both software segments missed, overall segment EBIT only in line (vs better performance at peers), Q4 EPS guidance below the Street, software revenue guidance reduced.\n* \\-5.3% **PFG-US** (Principal Financial): Q3 operating EPS missed in noisy report; NII ahead of consensus but fee income weaker; provision and expenses higher than consensus; analysts flagged challenges in both individual life and specialty benefits.\n* \\-4.1% **CNC-US** (Centene): Q3 earnings, revenue ahead with guidance raised though adjusted HBR missed; analysts noted earnings beat due to one-time favorable items including taxes, charity, ACA risk corridor receivable (which also flattered HBR); however enrollment grew faster than expected and SG&amp;A surprised lower.\n* \\-3.9% **SWK-US** (Stanley Black &amp; Decker): Q3 EPS and segment EBIT beat with help from cost control; however, revenue light and T&amp;S growth slower than expected; company flagged hit from promotional shift into October from September; expectations elevated with the stock a beneficiary of the at-home theme.\n* \\-3.6% **AMD-US** (Advanced Micro): To acquire XLNX-US in a $35B all-stock deal, or \\~27% higher than 8-Oct close before first report of potential deal; Q3 EPS, operating income revenue beat; GM in line; raised FY20 revenue growth ahead of Street.\n* \\-3.2% **CAT-US** (Caterpillar): Q3 revenue ahead with earnings near consensus after considering boost from tax; analysts noted weaker dealer sales led by Energy and Other segments mostly due to softness in Europe, earnings outlook appeared in line to slightly below consensus; however, pricing and margins were better and dealer inventory destocking well along.\n* \\-1.4% **MMM-US** (3M): Q3 earnings and revenue beat; organic growth shy of consensus with sales weaker in Transportation/Electronics; provided no guidance and sees persistent weakness in certain end markets; analysts generally positive but noted decelerating core growth.\n* \\-1.4% **TWLO-US** (Twilio): Q3 EPS and revenue beat; GM a bit light, ending active customers slightly below estimates; guided Q4 EPS and operating income below Street, but revenue ahead; analysts cautious on Q4 guide, though noted elevated expectations into print.\n\n09:25:11 AM CDT on 27 Oct '20",

Starting next monday, Shanghai (chinas second largest city) is restricting all traffic on major roads to shanghai license plate only. This means ppl who now have non-shanghai license plate need to get a Shanghai license plate ASAP. But it isn't that simple for non-EV cars who need to enter a lottery to get a license plate. EV vehicles on the other hand AUTOMATICALLY get a Shanghainese license plate. This policy in effect is a strong push for EV vehicles and to solve traffic issues in Shanghai. For those who don't know much about Shanghai.. Shanghai has a population of 26.32 million within 2,450 square miles. New York has 8.4 million living in 302 square miles.\n\n\n#nio",

This is the biggest RPG game of the decade. 8-10 years in making, it is not just slightly better than other games; it redefines the category. This thing is something everyone will be playing for years to come. Think of it as someone giving you a poke 3 weeks before the original Grand Theft Auto was released. This is the first in franchise.\n\n**Huge moat:** Cost of production is in $120 Million to $200 million range which puts it in the same league as Grand theft auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. GTA V has made 6 billion to date. Red Dead Redemption 2 made over $725 million in revenue in three days, and over 17 million copies shipped in total in two weeks. They have a staff of 500 working on this. It took 8-10 years to make this. No one else is gonna be able to compete for a long time.\n\n**Top dog within class:** There are many different game classes. This is gonna sit at the top of RPG class with anyone thinking about RPG games buying this.\n\n**Buzz:** I don't play video games but even I noticed the buzz. Any trailer, teaser, review that gets posted immediately gets several hundred views within days. [r/gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/) is losing its mind waiting for the release. This post got 134,000 upvotes and is the top post of the week: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/jezwed/its\\_been\\_8\\_years\\_my\\_friends/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/jezwed/its_been_8_years_my_friends/)\n\n89.5k votes [https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/jampi9/cyberpunk\\_2077s\\_entire\\_script\\_the\\_game\\_worth\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/jampi9/cyberpunk_2077s_entire_script_the_game_worth_a/)\n\n30.8k votes [https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/jfg296/be\\_ready/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/jfg296/be_ready/)\n\n**Huge nerd following:** Cyberpunk is a genre of fantasy that includes Blade Runner, Matrix trilogy, Terminator, Robocop, ... After dungeon and dragons and magic the gathering, cyberpunk role playing games have huge following. This is your chance to invest in nerds and fringe.\n\n**Wall Street** hasn't woken up to this because the company is Polish. But recently their ADR has been trading OTC without any analyst taking notice. This is your opportunity.\n\n**Uncorrelated** to the rest of the market. When everything else goes down this thing doesn't react. That's a massive advantage giving you uncorrelated gains.\n\nThe game has **Drugs, Nudity/Sex, Violence, Politically incorrect concepts, shooting, dystopia, and future technology.** You can even customize your penis in the game. I am not kidding. You really can customize your penis in the game.\n\n**Lots of Celebs:**\n\n* Keanu Reeves - Johnny Silverhand.\n* Michael-Leon Wooley - Dexter \"Dex\" DeShawn.\n* Grimes - Lizzy Wizzy.\n* Samuel Barnett - Delamain A.I.\n* Cherami Leigh\n\nPositions: You can only get shares. No options available for North Americans. Also traded in France, and of course Poland.\n\nDisclaimer: what you read was written by Comic Book guy from Simpsons.

      "selftext": "I've been invested and bullish on Ulta for about a year now. With the stock down 10% in the last 10 days, and nearly 50% of its all time highs of mid-2019, I think its currently trading at a bargain and a good time to buy. Here is my DD on Ulta, would love feedback.\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nUlta is a beauty store that sells makeup, skin care, hair care, and fragrance products, along with a small full service salon in each store. They currently operate 1,254 stores in all 50 states in the US, and are currently planning to move into the Canadian market. They also operate and sell via a strong website and mobile app with 789k reviews and 4.9 stars on the App store. \n\nLoyalty is a major part of their business through their Ultamate Rewards program. Their rewards program has 34 MILLION active members and accounts for 95% of their sales.\n\nThey get 95% of their revenues from product sales, and 5% from their slong services.\n\n**Market**\n\nThe market and competition is highly fragmented, competing against other beauty stores like Sephora and a number of online retailers. They see the beauty product market as a $89B market where they have 8% market share, and the beauty services market a $61B market where they have less than 1%.\n\n**Management**\n\nUlta's CEO is Mary Dillon, who has been at the company since 2013. She previously worked at McDonald's as an executive VP for 5 years. She is mostly compensated with stock awards which shows her long term commitment to the company's success. She has done an amazing job building out their online presence, navigating the COVID pandemic, keeping their debt levels low and ROIC high.\n\n**COVID Response**\n\nAs a retailer, COVID obviously posed major hurdles for their business. During COVID, they permanently closed 19 under-performing locations and temporarily furloughed their employees during the lockdown. They have been a company with $0 in debt since 2011, however during COVID they took out an $800M loan at a 1.9% interest to ensure they could navigate the pandemic, a loan they have more than enough cash on the balance sheets to pay off. \n\nWhile their total sales took a 26% decline during Q2 (during COVID), their online sales jumped 200%, showing that their online platforms they have invested in have paid off. They beat analysts Q2 expectations, earning $0.14 per share against estimates of $0.06 per share.\n\n**Financials**\n\nUlta's growth has been very impressive over the last 10 years. Since 2011, they have grown revenues 20%, EPS 30%, and Free Cash Flow 22%...all at a very consistent rate YOY. As I mentioned, their balance sheet is also very strong and until 2020 carried $0 in long term debt. They have grown their Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) at an impressive rate, over 20% every year since 2011 and up to 45% in 2019.\n\n**Stock Price**\n\nStock price is currently trading at $215 per share. This is down from its $241 level at the same time last year and down from $304 pre-COVID levels. In July 2019 the stock was trading as high as $358 per share. Their P/E ratio is sitting at 43 right now, but that is artificially high because their earnings took a major hit during COVID and I expect their earnings to continue to rise and help bring that P/E to a more reasonable level.\n\nPerforming a DCF on Ulta, if they continue their 20% growth rate over the next 10 years, they can achieve a 20% return for investors at these current levels. If their growth slows to 15%, they still show a return of 16% for investors.\n\n**Overall View**\n\nUlta is strongly positioned to grow in the future. They have strong management in Mary Dillon that has been with the company 7 years and has shown solid, continued growth for her business and kept debt at $0 excluding a low interest COVID loan. COVID certainly has taken a toll on this business and stock price, but I would argue it is oversold for how solid its business is performing. Even during a pandemic when all retailers were crushed and most of Ulta's stores were closed, they still turned a profit, revenues were only down 26%. Their mobile app and online store sales are highly reviewed and sales increased 200% through online orders during COVID. They have a very strong and loyal base of 34 million loyalty members that will continue to shop with Ulta, even during a pandemic and much longer after that. They will continue to open new strategic stores in the US and are moving internationally into Canada and other markets that have yet to be reached, providing more growth opportunity. \n\nFor these reasons, I am long $ULTA",

      "selftext": "The September quarter may seem like the corporate equivalent of a lame duck for Apple ￼, as the final quarter without any contribution to earnings from the newly unveiled iPhone 12 lineup. Investors are focused on demand for the new phones, but the results may still yield some surprises.\n\nWall Street is busily tweaking its numbers, resulting in a flurry of Monday research notes, before the figures come out late on Thursday. The consensus forecast is for revenue of $64.2 billion and per-share profits of 71 cents.\n\nAtlantic Equities analyst Ianjit Bhatti on Monday assumed coverage of Apple (ticker: AAPL) from one of his colleagues, lifting the firm’s rating to Overweight from Underweight, and setting a price target of $150. At the heart of his call is the idea that it would be a mistake to value Apple like just another tech company.\n\n“Having created an enduring premium consumer electronics brand, we believe that Apple’s product business should be valued in line with other premium and luxury consumer stocks, rather than traditional computer peers,” Bhatti writes. “Apple’s focus on delivering superior user experiences through design, enabled by its unsurpassed silicon to software design capabilities, has resulted in a premium product positioning, differentiating Apple against computing peers.”\n\nCiti’s Jim Suva sees potential upside to consensus estimates driven by iPads, Macs and Wearables, saying “work from home and stay at home trends continued to drive [an] uptick in consumer tech spending during the quarter.” He sees a promising hint in a recent strong earnings report from the peripherals company Logitech ￼ (LOGI), which said that iPad accessories were up 144% in the quarter. Suva maintains a Buy rating on the stock and a target of $125 for the share price.\n\nMeanwhile, Cowen’s Krish Sankar repeats his Outperform rating and $133 price target. He thinks September quarter results will be in line with Street estimates, driven by strong demand for iPads and Macs. For the December quarter, he sees sales up 48% sequentially and 5% year over year, with iPhone unit sales hitting 70 million.\n\n“Apple remains one of out top ideas in the hardware space,” he writes.\n\nRaymond James analyst Chris Caso, who has an Outperform rating on the stock, reports that lead times for the iPhone 12 as of Friday had stretched out to 2-3 weeks in all markets other than the U.S., where the phone was available for same-day or next-day pick up in most parts of the country. He echoes other analysts in finding that the iPhone 12 Pro is in tighter supply than the base iPhone 12, noting that Pro models are not available for in-store pickup in the US at this time.\n\n“This is generally consistent with prior launches, where inventories of the higher-end devices are generally lower than the mass market tier,” he writes.\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Amit Daryananai also repeats his Outperform rating and $135 price target, while adding a “tactical outperform” element to his call. He says the stock “should keep working higher,” driven by strong demand for hardware other than iPhones, acceleration in the services business, and strong iPhone 12 demand, driven in part by aggressive promotions offered by wireless carriers in the U.S. Apple’s commentary about the December quarter will be more positive than the Street expects when the company reports results on Thursday, he says.\n\nRBC Capital’s Robert Muller also had a bullish note on Apple on Monday, discussing the results of a survey of more than 800 Apple and Android users on their buying intentions.\n\n“We believe the results bode well for Apple’s newly released 5G enabled phones, which we expect will kick off a multi-year upgrade cycle,” he writes. “iPhone users appear quite sticky with 90% of iPhone customers either ‘definitely’ or ‘likely’ to remain in the ecosystem. This compares to just 71% of Android customers. Further, 24% of Android customers are considering an iPhone for this cycle, with 16% considering a switch to a 5G model. The Apple ecosystem remains strong with the average iPhone user owning 1.9 additional Apple products.”\n\nHe kept an Outperform rating and $132 price target on Apple shares.\n\nApple shares are up nearly 60% this year. The S&amp;P 500 is up 5% in 2020.\n\nSource: Barron's",

      "selftext": "Hey there, stock market noob here. I was gifted some stock in RR as a birthday (literally) gift from a family member. I've been sitting on these shares for 20 odd years as they have accrued in value, and now the company has agreed to a rights issue.\n\nI figure I have several options here, but feel fairly out of my depth in terms of actually making a decision, and would like to ask the good folks at /r/stocks for advice.\n\nWould it be more intelligent to:\n\nA) Buy the additional shares that are offered to me. The stock has been dependable, I can afford what has been offered, and I'm fairly confident that in the long term this move will likely pay off.\n\nB) Sell all my existing shares now. The pandemic may hurt the value of aeronautical companies in the long term, now might be a good time to liquidate these stocks.\n\nC) Sell my shares before the right issue, with the intention of purchasing **more** if RR stock drops. This is a 'risky' move but could potentially pay off. As I said in A, RR stock will likely be a solid investment in the long term, but in the short term with Covid continuing to hurt their profits, RR stock may drop to a point that I can acquire more overall stock by selling now, and buying on a downturn.\n\nD) Just take the cashless take up. Zero risk, moderate reward. I feel like this is a weakest option, but what the hell do I know?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAs I said I am compete greenhorn at this, so thank you for any help you can provide.",

S&amp;P down for a third straight session. Energy, tech, comm services, materials among the big decliners. FAANGs mostly underperforming.

After adjusting for stock-based compensation and other factors, the company reported earnings of 13 cents a share, up from adjusted earnings of a penny a share a year ago. Analysts on average expected adjusted earnings of 4 cents a share on sales of $383 million.\n\nPinterest shares jumped more than 25% in after-hours trading following the report, after closing with a 7.1% decline at $48.78. Shares were topping $63 in the extended session after closing with a 6.2% decline at $49.25; Pinterest shares have never traded for higher than $53.87 in regular trading.\n\nPinterest shares have more than doubled to record highs since the social-media company’s last earnings report, which predicted much higher revenue and user growth than previously expected. The online-advertising market seems to have found strength despite the pandemic, as strong third-quarter financial results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP sent stocks in ad-supported online companies higher across the board.\n\nOnline-ad stocks also experienced a jump after Pinterest’s report, which arrived 24 hours ahead of quarterly reports from online-ad powerhouses Facebook Inc. FB , Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG and Twitter Inc. TWTR . Twitter shares gained more than 5% in the extended session Wednesday, while Facebook stock increased more than 2% and Google parent Alphabet added about 1%.\n\nPinterest executives said they expect revenue to grow around 60% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, roughly in line with the 58% growth in the third quarter. Pinterest reported revenue of $400 million in last year’s holiday period, so the guidance suggests sales of about $640 million this year, which again trounces expectations. Analysts on average predicted fourth-quarter revenue of $541 million, according to FactSet.\n\nPinterest stock has gained 165% so far this year, and more than 106% in the past three months, as the S&amp;P 500 SPX index has gained 5% and 5.4% in those periods.\n\n[Source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/surge-in-pandemic-pinterest-users-continues-stock-jumps-more-than-20-toward-more-record-highs-11603916620)",

Let’s assume Biden wins the Presidency and the Senate turns blue. He’s talked a great deal about raising or even eliminating the capital gains tax on investments. Does it make sense to assume a lot of the higher ups and majority stockholders in companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, etc. (the mega caps) will begin to dump some of their holdings in their respective companies to avoid higher taxes in the future? I just can’t wrap my head around why they wouldn’t sell as much as they can before such a law comes into effect, pay their respective capital gains taxes, and buy back in to restart their cost basis.

The \"shorter of the period\" would be from the initial filing of the registration statement to the pricing date, so when the registration statement was declared effective (today, 10/28) to the offering closing on 10/30, correct? There were the only two dates from the article, so I assume these would constitute the period. Am I missing something here?\n\nIt would be great if someone could help me out here or at least point me in the right direction. Thanks!",

I am interested as a financial engineering standpoint.\n\n1) At least in Brazil, a mutual fund can be negative and so, the clients may be required to put more money if the fund goes negative. The plain vanilla way to triple short nasdaq, would be sell three times nasdaq futures. But if the nasdaq futures go up more than 50% one day, a 3x short utual fund would be negative and the clients would be required to put more money. At a ETF this can't happen. What would happen if nasdaq gone up more than 33% one day? \n\n2) I know they buy a bunch of swaps. I think these OTC contracts may replicate these returns. So, I guess, the ones doing the hard job are Morgan Stanley and other banking at the other side of these swaps. How Morgan Stanley hedge these swaps? I know how market makers delta hedge options, but I am interested how they do it for these swaps. \n\n3) How do the market makers create new shares? I also guess that the banks that sell these swaps act are market makers during the day. I know that for a regular ETF (name it QQQ), the market maker naked short for you the contract and at the same time they buy the underlying assets. At the end of the day, they go to Investco, give to them the assets and Investco emits to the Market Maker new etf shares. Because the underlying assets of SQQQ are OTC swaps, I think the only market makers available are the banks that sell the swaps for Investco.",

Turns out it was *all* of Tiktok, US and non-US.  Traffic stopped in Q3 and will remain stopped heading into Q4.  That traffic amounted to 10.8% of their business.\n\nOn the one hand, that's the worst it could have been.  But on the other hand, they just weathered about the biggest body blow imaginable, and it didn't even put much of a dent in their hull.\n\nThe Tiktok customer loss may not be permanent.  They say they're keeping an ongoing dialogue with them and keeping TikTok's capacity on reserve in case they want to come back if things change.  That's corporate talk for \"if Trump's Tiktok threat goes away\".\n\nFastly explained that some customers have a basic commitment of traffic, and then pay for whatever usage is above their commit level.  Typically that can be like 50 commit, 50 usage.  But Tiktok was apparently very low commit, so that means only low billing for Q3 and only the minimum billing for October of Q4 is in their projections.\n\nThe other rather mild negative is some new customer add-ones have been delayed a small bit by what they kept calling timing issues.  Code, travel, COVID, that sort of thing.  \n\nBut behind the gut punch of losing your biggest customer due to a presidential tantrum and extortion scheme, everything else sounded extremely promising.\n\nThey appear to have 42% growth and 58% margin.  For cloud/tech stocks, that means FSLY has an impressive 100 score on the rule of 40 gauge.  \n\nThey have just launched their compute-at-edge which should create impressive new abilities that haven't even been fully imagined yet.  \n\nThey also have got their Signal Sciences merger done and booking $8 million revenue will filled the hole that comes from losing Tiktok.  \n\nThey make the point that they have 300 customers so far in a market that has tens of thousands of potential customers, so the potential is immense.",

I found revolut pretty easy to understand and invested about 2000€ into stocks. \nWe all know the last few days we're a disaster and on top of that i got a mail from Revolut that because of Brexit i will no longer be protected by EU law and that i have to agree that i will trade with Revolut from 1st January with my own risk or sell everything and close the account.\nWhat do you suggest i do, should i sell now in this bad moment or continue trading with revolut.\nI dont know if me not being protected by EU is a big deal or not. \n\nCan anyone shed some light please?",

That obviously would be a huge positive upward move for oil companies.  One could sell all one's oil stocks after that.\n\nSome have predictions about the market share of EVs.  But those are a phase in over several years.  How many even need a new car EV or otherwise after shifting to working from home?\n\nThere are still a lot of gasoline powered cars out there.  The oil industry produces chemicals and plastics too.  In eastern MA the electric power grid runs 35% off nat gas.  \n\n  Again if oil companies are uninvestable I think it becomes the case after the virus immunity.\n\n  Also, remember how whenever there was a problem in the middle east oil would go up?\n\n  If there is election unrest here in the USA and people start breaking things, would that not also make oil go up since we are an oil producing country?",

Even from a content perspective, we’re able to instantly-purge content on your site to ensure content is fresh and most up to date. Companies also choose Fastly because of how API-friendly we are. We are the market leader in dynamic content delivery whereas legacy players have issues with caching what we call event-driven or dynamic content. This means that we can cache more and effectively outperform the market. DevOps teams love to use Fastly because you can add custom logic to the network edge so that they can either make quick changes without the cost of professional services. Saying this, though, our partners are amazed at the support that Fastly can provide, on top of the extensive documentation on the developers hub that your team has on-hand.

I've looked into it but there is one thing I still don't fully understand.\n\nOn Investopedia they explain it by this scenario: 10 shareholders hold 1 share each, every share is worth 10%, giving them 10% ownership of the company. The company issues 10 new shares, all bought by one new shareholder. This shareholder now owns 50% of the company, the stock of the other shareholders is now reduced to 5% of the company.\n\nWhat is the company actually selling here? How is value being created? The way I see it the company just sold 50% percent of each of the original shareholders' stake, pocketing the money, which ofcourse doesn't make any sense.\n\nSo for RR, they offered 10 new shares for every existing 3. Are the 13 total shares worth the same as the original 3? If so, how is this different from a stock split where the company takes ownership of the new shares?\n\nI must me missing something here. Any explanation or links to videos/articles explaining it would be very helpfull, thanks.",

The prior shareholder letter stated that Fastly’s acquisition of Signal Sciences would contribute approximately $8 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020. This represents the deferred revenue that Signal Sciences expected to recognize in the fourth quarter, but does not reflect purchase price accounting adjustments from the acquisition. These adjustments could materially reduce the amount of Signal Sciences’ deferred revenue that will be recognized in the fourth quarter.\nThis updated shareholder letter can be found on the Investor Relations section of its website at https://investors.fastly.com.",

This might be a good day for people who think they missed the boat on some EV stocks or BABA. On the other hand, those stocks haven't done that badly in recent pullbacks in the US markets this week. \n\n______\n\nAlso, this is my first heads-up that while retail investors are being fed one line of warnings and dire accusations of worthlessness about Chinese assets in the popular media and from politicians, US institutional and professional investors, including [our leading investment banks,](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/goldman-sachs-among-banks-working-on-41b-ant-ipo) have been quietly ramping up their holdings of Chinese stocks and a record amount of [Chinese corporate bonds](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/inflows-into-chinese-bond-market-hit-records-in-july-spurred-by-fears-of-missing-out-2020-08-12) and [Chinese government bonds](https://www.ft.com/content/c1e8897c-32a5-402d-837a-ba7df135c069), and opening new business fronts in China this year. Personally, I've seen enormous amounts of steady volume that suggests and strong, steady but quiet institutional buying, in Chinese stocks during this period of volatility. For example, trading in Chinese EV stocks can be routinely in the tens and hundreds of millions of shares a day now, which far outstrips the trading even in US mega cap stocks on volatile days. \n\nThe disconnect between the information that the average retail investor in the US gets from popular media, while US professional investors are piling into China, and the information that you get from reading international news is pretty significant. It seems to me that a lot of US retail investors are being misled into holding the bag for a couple of dozen inflated mega cap stocks in a US stock market bubble while professional, institutional and investment bank majors have been quietly building magnificent stakes in Asian investments in Q2 and Q3, to the point where they're piling in with billions even as retail investors are being constantly warned about how bad the investments are. But this is my personal opinion.\n\nJust saying.",

Inspire, the owner of Arby’s and other chains that is backed by private-equity firm Roark Capital, said the deal will make it the second-largest U.S. restaurant chain by domestic sales after McDonald’s Corp. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year, the companies said on Friday.\n\nInspire said its all-cash deal to take the owner of Dunkin’ coffee shops and Baskin-Robbins ice cream stores private would value it at $106.50 a share, a 20% premium to its closing price on Oct. 23, before the New York Times reported last weekend that the two companies were discussing a possible deal.\n\nThe price of $106.50 a share would give Dunkin’ a market valuation of $8.8 billion. The chain’s stock closed on Friday at $100, up 32% this year.\n\n[Source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inspire-brands-to-acquire-dunkin-brands-group-for-11-3-billion-including-debt-11604102999)",

      "selftext": " As a value investor, one of the things I look out for is a catalyst for price realisation. After all, even if a stock is criminally undervalued, if it does not have something in its future that will cause other people to wake up to its value, it could stay undervalued forever. Today I’m going to talk about a company that has a very clear catalyst which the value, as well as price of the stock, hinges upon. If the catalyst is positive, the upside is enormous, with the stock possibly doubling or tripling almost overnight.\n\nIt all started about 6 months ago when I decided to analyse automation. The coming 4th Industrial Revolution will see human-performed tasks being done by robots, and companies that provide these automation services could do very well indeed. After a quick screen, Hollysys Automation Technologies immediately jumped out at me: the company presented itself with spectacular financials characterized by high liquidity; low debt; steadily growing FCF/revenue/net income over the decade; consistent book value; an average ROE of 15% over a decade, ROCE 13%, a stock price trading at a 30-50% discount compared to competitors, and DCF models estimating a value of $30-40 (currently trading about $11). In other words, the dream of any value investor.\n\nI will be the first to admit I don’t have as much knowledge in the automation industry as I’d like – and that’s something I’ve been working on over the past few months. So, after a quick look at their impressive financial statements, our next step was to talk to the IR of the various Hollysys competitors to better understand the competitive environment that Hollysys were operating in, and whether they could preserve their impressive return ratios over the long term.\n\nAs a quick overview of the company, Hollysys operates in two segments: industrial automation and railway automation. In industrial, most of the company’s revenue comes from automating fossil fuel energy plants. It would not be unfair to compare it to a defence company or a public contractor, since the Chinese Communist Party controls the state railways and owns a 75% stake in SINOPEC, China's largest and most important oil company. In addition, the company also has a dominant market position in safety systems for nuclear power plants in China, a sector that is growing with a CAGR of 17%, bringing the number of reactors in the country from 16 in 2012 to 56 in 2020. As the only certified provider of nuclear automation services in the country, HOLI has a monopoly in this subsector.\n\nIn the railway sector they hold a 30% market share, and they do not expect further increases in market share. Long-term organic revenue growth is likely to be 5%, primarily coming from after-sale services. However, they are actively researching new products such as CBTC (*Communications-based train control*) in subways, smart systems on highways, etc. If these products gain traction, which they should, then growth will be higher. Also, the company proved to have a great competitive advantage in the high-speed railway field as they are 1 of the 3 approved providers in 300-350km/h segment and 200-250km/h and the largest company in terms of ATP (on board equipment) sets.\n\nIn their ‘Smart factories’ subsegment, they provide solutions to accelerate product development cycles for large white goods companies like Haier. They provide integrated data collection products like SCADA (*Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition*), data utilisation and analysing services to understand the application situations, designing the system architecture, data management and so on, being the largest company in terms of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition. Another example of this subsegment of industrial automation would be their contract with Diaobignshan where they used to collect data to build a factory virtually and rapidly iterated designs to optimise efficiencies at low cost. They provide after-build services such as combustion optimization, equipment monitoring and maintenance, etc. This segment generates real tangible returns for customers, with higher production efficiencies and lower cost. However, it’s worth noting that some of their revenue in this segment comes from fossil fuel companies as well, so a surge in renewable builds could see revenue dropping even more than it would appear at first glance.\n\nAll the segments that Hollysys operates in have been growing impressively for the past few years, at a rate above even the high growth of the general Chinese economy. To fuel their supply-side based growth, fossil fuel plants have been opening across China at an unprecedented rate, while China’s high-speed railway network has gone from virtually non-existent 15 years ago to being 2/3rds of the entire world’s track length. As Chinese wages rise, the pressure on factory owners to automate is also increasing to stave off price competition from South-East Asian competitors.\n\nSo far, the situation all looks good from a high-level company view. But when you either zoom out to look at the macro environment, or in to look at the specifics of the business, cracks begin showing.\n\nThe situation with the Chinese government is tricky – and not for the reason you might think. Despite the fact that most of HOLI’s revenue comes from state-owned entities, and it’s monopolistic market position also dependent on the government, we do not see the government introducing competition to the market to drive down prices as a big threat. China has applied a protect-and-nurture strategy for domestic companies in every sector you could think of very successfully, creating such behemoths as Tencent and Alibaba. You prevent superior foreign competition from entering the market, and choose a winner for each sector, allowing it to take monopolistic profits to accelerate the rate of innovation and shorten the timeline that it needs to compete with foreign companies. From the past decade, Hollysys is the chosen winner for the sectors that it competes in, and that the threat of increased competition due to the Chinese government is virtually non-existent. Companies like Siemens or ABB still have objectively superior products and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Until HOLI catches up with them and can compete in a global free market, the handholding from the government will not end.\n\nHowever, while the Chinese government will not introduce competition to the markets that HOLI competes in, whether it will continue to incentivise those markets is another question entirely. In a recent Chinese government conference, China firmly stated that it would become carbon neutral by 2060 (pay attention: NET carbon emissions will be equal to 0, and not TOTAL emissions, which is quite different). I have no doubt that this will happen – the largest benefit of a single-party state is that these long-term plans can be set in stone and executed upon decades in advance, something which China has been doing since the ways of Deng. And quite obviously, there is consequently a very real threat to the heavily polluting fossil fuel-based power plants that HOLI derives a lot of its revenue from. Banning the construction of new fossil fuel plants is an obvious way to reach this target, but whether China chooses to do this or to find alternative methods of cutting net emissions is less obvious. I would like to remind you that coal consumption, which fell from 2013 to 2017, driven in part by China's willingness to significantly improve air quality, has started to rise again in more recent years as the economy suffered a severe backlash forcing the government to stimulate industrial growth.   \n Although the government has not released some specifics regarding how these emissions will be reduced, it is thought that this was strongly desired to allow the Communist Party to have the flexibility necessary in the short term to support the economic recovery following the pandemic. Renewables cannot as yet compete with fossil fuels in lifetime cost of operation, and building more fossil plants is a tried-and-true method of giving the economy a shot in the arm, something that any economy could do with right now.\n\nAt the same time, future constructions of railways are also uncertain. Most of the tracks laid in recent years is economically unviable, with low demand and a poor populace in these tier-3 cities laying a cap on ticket prices. However, the government views high-speed rail as a socially beneficial alternative to coaches and planes for the hundreds of millions of migrant workers that travel between large cities and the country every holiday, and thus heavily subsidises losses and encouraged more construction in the last 5-year plan. Whether continued construction in both railways and fossil fuel power plants will happen is up in the air and something that we will see in the next 5-year plan, due in March 2021.\n\nA natural response to the threat to fossil fuel power generation automation would be to ask whether Hollysys could simply transition to automating the renewable power generation sector. My research indicates that this is not realistic. The various wind turbines, solar panels, dams, etc. they do not require a complex level of automation like that used in a refinery plan. The latter are huge power plants that occupy hundreds of square meters which require automated processes to obtain the greatest result with the least effort.\n\n📷 [https://postimg.cc/JtMhBQRR](https://postimg.cc/JtMhBQRR)\n\n^(image from https://www.e-education.psu.edu/eme801/node/4701)\n\nWhile as regards the structures and machines used for renewable energy, they do not require complicate automated processes such as those used in oil and petrochemical plants; the entire process is enclosed within the turbine itself (as far as wind energy is concerned), so that it becomes almost impossible to state that these types of energy require any automation processes. In the image below I have shown you what the inside of a wind turbine looks like, which differs drastically from the previous image of the refinery plant.\n\n📷 [https://postimg.cc/p9K2mm79](https://postimg.cc/p9K2mm79)\n\n^(image from) ^(https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/inside-wind-turbine)\n\nA field of application, which is very different from the one discussed above, could be to offer automation processes for the companies that produce the different solar panels, wind turbines and so on. This, however, has nothing to do with the automation processes used in oil and petrochemical businesses; here we are dealing with real industrial processes which cannot be connected to the former since they are completely different fields.\n\nThe problem is that we are not sure if Hollysys can provide such solutions and even if it is able, we do not know the time needed for this transition. One of Hollysys' strengths was its vast knowledge in the oil industry, which allowed it to keep various competitors away, but this advantage will not be reflected in the renewable sector since they have no knowledge in this field and, and from what I’ve seen, the company has not shown any interest in this sector, neither from the various conference calls held in the past nor from the annual or quarterly reports, which suggests management is either unaware of the threat or incapable of addressing it. The fact that management accounts for some fossil fuel plant automation revenue in ‘smart factories’ suggests the latter, and that they’re trying to make it look less serious than it is.\n\nWe are not saying that the company is in danger of failure, since it still has two other revenue streams to rely on, but we will certainly see a decrease in revenues (in 2019, 41% of revenues derive from automation sector, of those 41%, 40% are from oil industries) and a deterioration in the relationship with the Chinese government.\n\nOverall, the conclusion can be drawn that if the coming 5-year plan is unfavourable to Hollysys, the company will face serious setbacks to its short and long-term prospects as the market is pricing in, while a positive 5-year plan that encourages construction of both fossil fuel plants and railways would be hugely accretive to the value of the company. My personal stance is to wait and see what the 5-year plan says – with a small-cap Chinese stock like this, the market is unlikely to immediately react and fully reprice Hollysys on positive news, allowing me a chance to get in after the future is secure even if I miss out some gains. The uncertainty regarding the possible downside to a company is something I hate, although if you have more stomach for risk and think the 5-year plan will be friendly to HOLI, you could jump in now.\n\nIf you are positive enough to jump in now you may find interesting that in my positive-scenario-model, I therefore attribute to the automation sector a CAGR of about 5% for the next 10 years, the railway sector a CAGR of 5-6% (assuming continued construction in the next 5-year plan) and attribute to the nuclear sector a CAGR of 12-15% given the enormous progress made in this particular sector in the last 10 years. The final stock price would be something between $25-30 but only if Hollysys starts to be valued with the same multiples of its peers and Chinese government postpones its good intentions to reduce their carbon impact on the rest of the world in order to sustain Chinese’s economy recovery.\n\nOther important facts concerning the company:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* About 3 months ago the ex-CEO Baiqing Shao was changed, who has      held the role for more than 7 years and was one of the founders of the      company, with a member of the company's directors, Mr Colin Shang. The      reasons for this decision were not entirely transparent, as the company      initially stated that the CEO had left office and remained on good terms      with the company, but in the latest quarterly report the company states      the following: \"**Dispute in connection with the ownership of Ace      Lead Profits Limited (\" Ace Lead \") may adversely impact us.\"**      *We were made aware of a shareholder’s dispute regarding ownership of one      of the principal shareholders. In August 2016, Mr. Changli Wang, the then      sole shareholder of Ace Lead, one of our record shareholders, transferred      his single share in Ace Lead to Mr. Baiqing Shao for a nominal      consideration. As of the date hereof, Ace Lead owns 4,144,223 ordinary      shares of our company, representing 6.9% of the outstanding shares of our      company. We were recently notified that Mr. Wang indicated that, as Mr.      Shao had stepped down as the chairman and chief executive officer of our      company since July 2020, he should no longer be entitled to any share in      Ace Lead and he should immediately transfer the share in Ace Lead to one      or more persons designated by Mr. Wang. As of the date of this annual      report, Mr. Shao has not transferred the share in ACE Lead to any      designees of Mr. Wang. We cannot predict the outcome of the dispute. If      Mr. Shao refuses to transfer the share in ACE Lead to a person designated      by Mr. Wang, the dispute could escalate and litigation may ensue between      Mr. Shao and Mr. Wang, and our company may become involved. Any escalation      of this dispute, including potential litigation, may cause us to incur      significant time, resources and cost if we were to become involved.*  \nAs easily understood this does not seem a \"friendly\" decision by the old CEO, moreover with 7% of the shares in circulation he can do much more damage to the company by attending the shareholders' meetings, being one of the shareholders with the highest participation .\n* Many impairments of goodwill. The M&amp;E refers to two companies      they bought, Concord and Bond. They are based in Singapore and Malaysia.      But their business spread in south east Asian and middle east. Before      COVID-19, the macro-economy situation in those areas was not good, and      then COVID-19 brought new challenges. Therefore, their management expects      future lower profit in M&amp;E. They also do not give guidance on the      development of M&amp;E since the company think risk control is the key      focus, rather than revenue growth.\n* When they got asked what they thought about Trump will to delist      Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges they said that they are evaluating      recent issues that may potentially affect their status as a Nasdaq-listed      company and it is prudent to say that they do not exclude that option. So,      no real answer was given about that, which makes me think that they do not      have any plan for the near future.\n* IR is slow to respond to investors. I sent two emails, the first of      which was generally positive and the second follow-up which raised some of      the issues discussed in this article. IR has not responded to the second      for more than a month, which makes me very uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, I wanted to give you a feedback on what Hollysys has to say about this matter but investor relator has not replied to my email for more than 1 month, this gives you a clue on how bad their communication with investors is. On the other hand, I have scheduled another call with one of their competitors on 18 November to talk about what can be done for companies like these to keep up with the almost sure transition that China will experience in the following years.",

      "selftext": "To the irritation of Wall Street analysts, investors, and tech-stock columnists, five of the most important technology companies on Earth all reported financial results within a few minutes of each other on Thursday afternoon. Yeesh, what was wrong with Wednesday? The surface-level news was that all five—Apple ￼, Amazon.com ￼, Alphabet ￼, Facebook ￼, and Twitter ￼—beat expectations for both sales and profits. But there were more revealing details to be found beneath the headlines.\n\nWaiting for 5G: Let’s start with Apple (ticker: AAPL), still the largest company on Earth by market capitalization, but now worth less than $2 trillion as its shares have fallen 20% from their 2000 high. This was an awkward quarter for Apple. Investors are buzzed about the new iPhone 12 line, but the phones have just started shipping, and weren’t available in the September quarter. Apple CEO Tim Cook said iPhone sales in the quarter beat internal expectations, but they were a little shy of Wall Street consensus estimates. Worrisome was a sharp drop in sales in “Greater China.” They fell 29% from a year ago. The apparent issue: China is ahead of the U.S. on 5G, and other phone makers already have 5G phones on the market. Would you buy a 4G phone now? Didn’t think so.\n\nApple didn’t give formal guidance, but it gave some solid hints. It expects iPhone sales to rise year over year, despite the late start for the new iPhones, with double-digit revenue growth for every other hardware line and services. Apple also expects a return to growth in China. And, by the way: Macs, iPads, and Wearables together generated almost $24 billion in sales in the quarter, up a combined 30% year over year. On a run-rate basis, Apple’s non-iPhone hardware this quarter will surpass $100 billion. Services is approaching $60 billion. Apple bought back $18 billion of stock in the quarter. Stop worrying; Apple will be fine.\n\nShop! In the Name of Love: U.S. online holiday shopping is expected to grow 33% this year to $189 billion, according to a report last week from Adobe Systems ￼, based on data gathered from 80 of the 100 largest online retailers. Amazon (AMZN) didn’t need to read that report. The e-commerce giant posted 39% sales growth in North America in the September quarter. But profit-margin guidance for the fourth quarter gave investors pause: Amazon expects to have $4 billion in Covid-related costs in the quarter, up from $2.5 billion in the third quarter. Also, this year Prime Day fell in the fourth quarter; Amazon notes that those aren’t the company’s highest-margin sales. But let’s not forget that Amazon crushed operating-income guidance for the September quarter. It wouldn’t be shocking if it did it again. Amazon vowed last week to hire 100,000 temporary workers for the holidays. No company has benefited more from the acceleration in online shopping.\n\nBuy Stuff Now! Online-ad platforms are also benefiting from the e-commerce surge. Amazon had “other revenue”—mostly ads—of $5.4 billion in the quarter, up 50%. eBay ￼’s [EBAY] ad revenue rose 77% in the period. Snap ￼ [SNAP] and Pinterest ￼ [PINS] recently posted ad-driven earnings beats, spurring huge stock moves. So it was no surprise that both Alphabet [GOOGL] and Facebook [FB] blew away top-line estimates. Remember the Facebook ad boycott? Heh. It’s not working. Google parent Alphabet has been the megacap laggard this year, with a gain of under 20%, but it was the star Thursday. YouTube alone had $5 billion in ad sales, up 32%. And then there’s Google Cloud.\n\nIn Clouds We Trust: All that hype about the public cloud? It’s understated. Microsoft ￼ [MSFT] said its commercial cloud business was up 31% in the September quarter—and Azure was up 48%. Amazon Web Services revenue rose 29%; Google Cloud’s jumped 45%. The German enterprise-software giant SAP ￼ [SAP] slashed its revenue outlook this past week, declaring itself determined to accelerate its cloud transition, and the stock lost more than a quarter of its value. There is a lack of pure plays on the public cloud. You could do worse than owning a basket of Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nDeciphering Jeff: A standard part of every earnings press release is the CEO quote. Usually the boss waxes poetic about the quarter, or raves about the company’s engineers or huge addressable market. Amazon’s release this quarter quotes CEO Jeff Bezos saying that retailers everywhere should match the company’s $15-an-hour minimum-wage rate: “We hope other large employers will also make the jump to $15. Now would be a great time.”\n\nThat’s a strange quote for an earnings release. A PR move to show Amazon is a solid corporate citizen? An attempt to embarrass lower-paying rivals? It’s weird.\n\nMerlin’s Beard! The loser on Tech Trillions Thursday was Twitter [TWTR]. Earlier in the week, CEO Jack Dorsey was grilled by Senate Republicans who think social networks censor conservative political content. Dorsey appeared on screen for the virtual hearing with a long beard—a little bit Confucius, a little ZZ Top. Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) accused Dorsey of being a pawn of the left, but the senator is worrying about the wrong platform. Twitter added just one million daily average users in the quarter, well below expectations. It has under 200 million users. Facebook’s platforms have a combined 2.5 billion daily actives—about a third of the world’s population. There’s a reason Twitter’s valuation is just 5% of Facebook’s. Don’t forget to vote.\n\nSource: Barron's",

Also a worry is that Senate elections could be unresolved, which means it may not be known which party holds the majority.\n*****\n&gt; “If there’s no clear winner, it will be negative for risk assets...The market is really worried about not having clarity after the election. They’re worried about it dragging out four weeks as the results are contested,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. “The overall landscape is not a political one. It’s that we’re in a pandemic, and we don’t want an uncertain election outcome that leaves the country concerned about leadership.”\n*****\n&gt; Stocks closed out October on a sour note, losing about 6% for the week, the worst performance since March, when the pandemic first shut down the economy. Strategists say the coronavirus is again worrying the market, as major European countries go into partial lockdowns, and the U.S. faces record numbers of new cases.\n*****\n&gt; Lyngen said he does not expect the markets to react as much if it’s only the fate of the Senate that is undetermined. But that is still very important, and if it’s not clear which party has a majority for days or even weeks, that would cast doubt on the ability of whichever candidate wins the presidency to pursue their policy agenda.\n*****\n&gt; # Senate key for stimulus\n&gt; The Senate is also key to how much money will be poured into the economy to help battle the impact of the virus. For instance, if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the White House, but Democrats do not reclaim the Senate, he will likely have to compromise on a smaller stimulus package and would not be able to implement tax increases. If President Donald Trump is re-elected and faces a newly Democratic Senate alongside the Democratic House, he will likely face push back on many issues though they may agree on a large stimulus package.\n*****\n&gt; As of Friday, Biden was leading Trump in the polls by 7.8 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of major polls. Democrats also appear likely to take the Senate, but some races are very tight.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America strategists note that the Senate races are close with a few seats that could flip. Seven Republican seats are currently rated as toss-ups with four in battleground states, where they could be lost if there’s a strong Democratic surge. There could also be a clear majority, but still uncertainty in terms of final makeup.\n*****\n&gt; “The overall composition of the Senate is unlikely to be determined until sometime in January due to election rules in Georgia which stipulates the race goes to a run off if no candidates garners 50% majority in the general election and currently no candidate is projected” to hit that threshold, the BofA strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; The strategists say the timing of the results is unclear due to early voting but high volumes of mail-in ballots, which cannot be counted in some states until election day.\n*****\n&gt; “A short delay in the election result should have a trivial impact on the economy but a multi-week contested election could drag down H1 GDP growth by 0.5-1.0 pp,” according to BofA strategists. “Once there is a winner, the focus turns to stimulus.”\n*****\n&gt; # Watch bond yields\n&gt; That could mean bond yields will continue their move higher in the coming week. Yields have been rising on the idea that there will be some kind of stimulus after the election, and it will mean more U.S. debt and higher interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; “We expect rates to shift higher by 5 to 25 bps after the election outcome is known due to expectations for fiscal stimulus and improved growth prospects,” the BofA strategists wrote. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 0.86% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; However, if the election outcome is not known for awhile, the strategists said a contested outcome could push the 10-year yield materially lower.\n*****\n&gt; If there is a contested election, the strategist expect stocks to trade lower, but it would be a buying opportunity since the market typically recovers from headline-related losses within six months.\n*****\n&gt; “We expect a clear outcome to be neutral to positive for the market in the near term, except under a Biden win with a split Congress, which could potentially lead to continued gridlock in fiscal stimulus talks,” the BofA strategists added.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the election, there is also a Fed meeting, expected to end Thursday with no new announcements though it is likely the Fed will emphasize it will keep policy easy for a long time as the economy heals. The October employment report is expected on Friday and is expected to show continued job gains, after September’s 661,000 nonfarm payrolls.\n*****\n&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equities strategist at Credit Suisse, does not expect the market to react much if the election outcome is as expected, with Biden winning and Democrats taking the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; “The most likely outcome is already discounted by the market. The best assumption is if you don’t have a big surprise, the market should do nothing,” Golub said, adding the most volatile week could be the one just ending. “This week is the one with the turmoil, and I don’t think the next week is the one where the market’s going to be crazy.”\n*****\n&gt; Golub said investors may be too worried about the election being unresolved and the real issue disturbing the market this past week is the growing spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; “There’s no rule we need to declare a victor,” said Golub. “We have four or five weeks. The market may not love that near-term indecision, but the system is set up to allow for it, and as long as things don’t go off the rails, and they really shouldn’t, this concern about a contested election is probably overblown as an investor issue.”\n*****\n&gt; Golub said there’s a greater chance that the winner of the presidency is known before the Senate. “The chances are that we’ll at least know directionally where the power sits, but that could take a little longer and the market may be a little uncomfortable with that,” he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings reports\n&gt; Dozens of companies report earnings in the week ahead, and Golub said corporate profits are a bright spot for the market. The third quarter results so far are showing earnings down about 10%, compared to earlier forecasts of more than 20%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; “The reality is the economy is robust. 55% of the market cap of the S&amp;P has higher earnings in 2020 than in 2019. More than half the market is acting like there’s no recession, no downturn,” Golub said.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said both Trump and Biden would push for fiscal stimulus, but while the market is clear on where Trump stands it does not know that much about Biden, if he were to win. “It is going to take some time to get clarity on which of his policy initiatives are going to happen. I don’t believe he’s going to implement these tax increases he’s talking about right away. I think the economy is too frail,” said Golub.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TQBrNag.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LrQZHOj.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/WbqKDDT.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zqi6l3G.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9q0jEby.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xGuEP7D.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2SrRdkk.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tCh05mj.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qOJdagC.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KhE54Ws.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rrDYFK6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QEbWDb7.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zBMyLqA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # November Almanac: Usually a Top Month in Election Years\n\n&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.\n\n&gt; November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950), NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 2000 (since 1979) month. November is best for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 1000 (since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/43b1cac3b88cfc6f79063d86ae9abfef/57e8d7f397fbeeb8-7f/s400x600/a8bff5e250ce7b9735197427f72d665b61fe0614.jpg))**\n\n&gt; November is a mixed bag in presidential election years. DJIA has advanced in 10 of the last 17 election years since 1952 with an average gain of 1.7%. Significant DJIA declines occurred in 2008 (-5.3%) and 2000 (-5.1%). For S&amp;P 500 November ranks best with a similar record to DJIA. NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 are not as strong ranking #7, #3 and #6 respectively. Fewer years of data (12 for NASDAQ and 10 for Russell indices) combined with sizable losses in 2000 and 2008 drag down rankings and average gains when compared to DJIA and S&amp;P 500.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Whatever the Outcome, Day Before Election Day Historically Bullish\n\n&gt; Looking back at the last seventeen presidential elections since 1952, the day before Election Day has a clear bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined just three times and average gains of 0.51% and 0.44% respectively. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly weaker, but still bullish. Election Day (or the day after prior to 1980) leans bullish, but with a greater frequency of losses. Incumbent party victories are shaded in light grey.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d030ea31abcb4bd298b596da0d2b2b4d/3d5b7e5afba3a9a5-14/s500x750/a8b43d243e3c57890dde8a0682726a1da587e5d2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # GDP Bounces Back\n\n&gt; The outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns triggered the largest quarter over-quarter decline in gross domestic product (GDP) since WWII, so perhaps it comes as no surprise that the following quarter tallied the sharpest rebound in that same time period. GDP expanded 33.1% on an annualized basis in the third quarter, ahead of Bloomberg consensus expectations of 32%, fueled by the continued reopening of businesses and reversing much of the economic fallout stemming from COVID-19-related lockdowns.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, consumer spending—the largest contributor to GDP in the US and roughly 70% of economic output—rebounded in a powerful fashion in the third quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.29.20-Blog-Chart.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; However, spending numbers were uneven, with a considerably larger portion spent on goods rather than services—consistent with the continued behavioral and business restriction effects on these industries. Further, the timing of spending was also fairly uneven, as much of the growth in consumer spending came in the early weeks of the third quarter and tapered off in recent weeks where the effects of fiscal stimulus and rising new COVID-19 cases influenced consumer behavior.\n\n&gt; “GDP rebounded stronger than expected in the third quarter, but the big question on everyone’s mind is whether the economy can remain on firm ground in the fourth quarter and into 2021,” stated LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Barring a new round of fiscal stimulus, it’s likely that growth will taper off in the fourth quarter, but we still don’t expect a double-dip recession.”\n\n&gt; Regardless of the state of economic momentum, it is remarkable that GDP is already only about 3.5% away from recovering the entire pandemic losses. The resilience of US consumers has been the top story of the recovery, even with the historic fiscal stimulus.\n\n&gt; The surge in growth in the third quarter may also have political implications. As we noted in our recent Weekly Market Commentary: Are the Polls Wrong Again? the average GDP growth in the second and third quarters of election years can have predictive power for who wins the election, with stronger growth favoring incumbents. However, we also point out that recessions close to elections have favored challengers, sending some conflicting market signals heading into Election Day!\n\n&gt; As the economy moves forward in the fourth quarter, we’ll continue to monitor real-time data indicators to gauge the impact of rising COVID-19 cases on consumer and business behavior.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Slight Dip In Consumer Confidence\n\n&gt; Consumer Confidence for the month of October was released earlier today and showed a slight dip relative to September. The headline index dropped from 101.3 down to 100.9 compared to expectations for a reading of 102.0. Given the rising number of cases and the upcoming election, it's not too surprising to see confidence come in a bit, so a decline of this magnitude isn't all that concerning. What is notable, though, is that even though Consumer Confidence remains right near post-COVID highs, it hasn't bounced all that much off its lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC.png))**\n\n&gt; Breaking out this month's report by the sentiment of consumers towards both how they feel now and what they expect in the future, the Present Situation Index rose from 98.9 up to 104.6 while the Expectations component dropped from 102.9 down to 98.4. The drop in the Expectations component of this month's report looks like it's a partial reflection of growing uncertainty regarding COVID and the election as we head into the colder months of November and December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-P-Exp.png))**\n\n&gt; In looking at the spread between Present Conditions and Expectations, it moved back into positive territory this month after dropping deeply into negative territory earlier this year. What's interesting to note about current levels is that in every prior recession since the late 1960s, by the time the spread moved back into positive territory after turning negative, the recession was already well in the rearview mirror.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Sentiment towards jobs also suggests a relatively positive trend. At the current level of 26.5, the Jobs Plentiful index is still far from its 40+ reading before COVID, but it did increase again in October as it has now done in four of the last five months. While it's by no means a strong reading at current levels, it hasn't been getting worse either. Looking at past recessions, it wasn't until well after the recession ended that the Jobs Plentiful index started to rebound.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-Jobs-plentiful.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Industrials Malfunction\n\n&gt; With poorly received earnings reports from 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT) and general weakness overall, Tuesday was just a bad day for the Industrials sector. Just five stocks in the sector were up on the day and the sector overall was down 2.2% compared to the S&amp;P 500 which was down just 0.3%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials-Sector-Perfoamnces.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and the Industrials sector over the last year. Positive readings indicate the S&amp;P 500 outperforming the Industrials sector and negative readings indicate that the Industrials sector outperformed the S&amp;P 500. With the S&amp;P 500 outperforming the Industrials sector by 1.88 percentage points on Tuesday, it was the widest performance gap (in the S&amp;P 500's favor) since 9/21. Even more notable, though, was the fact that there have only been three other days in the last year where the Industrials sector underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a wider margin.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials-Sector-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; For the sector as a whole, it currently finds itself in a precarious position. After breaking its uptrend off the March lows on 9/21, the Industrials sector bounced back and rallied back to its former uptrend line, and while it just recently made a post-COVID high, the rally ran out of steam right at the former uptrend line. In the pullback that has followed, the sector closed yesterday right at a secondary line of support from the June lows. If this level doesn't hold through today's close, the technical picture for the sector will look a lot different than the way it looked just a few weeks ago.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # All or Nothing Days Back on the Rise\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's A/D line for the day (number of advancing stocks minus number of declining stocks) currently stands at about -460, which would be the weakest one-day reading since June. Today's A/D reading also is notable in that it represents the tenth 'all or nothing' day for the S&amp;P 500 since the index's last peak on 9/2. We consider 'all or nothing' days to be those days where the S&amp;P 500's daily A/D reading is either above +400 or below -400. To put the frequency of 'all or nothing' days into perspective, while there have been ten in the last forty trading days, in the forty trading days before that there weren't any.\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the percentage of 'all or nothing' days on a 50-day rolling basis. The current pace of 20% is still well off the extraordinary level of 44% we saw back in late April/early May, but it is still relatively high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102820-AllorNothing-50.png))**\n\n&gt; Including today, there have now been 41 'all or nothing' days so far in 2020. If the current pace for the entire year keeps up that will put us on pace for fifty days this year. If the current pace keeps up and we do reach 50 'all or nothing' days this year, it will be the third-highest annual total behind 2011 (70) and 2008 (52), but even if there isn't another 'all or nothing' day this year, 2020 would still rank fifth behind the years from 2008 through 2011.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102820-AllorNothing-All.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Earnings and Economics Diverge\n\n&gt; This earnings season, we have frequently mentioned how beat rates have continued to rise relentlessly. From our Earnings Explorer database, our 3-month rolling EPS beat rate currently stands at a record high of 78.19%. That is nearly 20 percentage points higher than the historical average of 59.37%. The sales beat rate is not at a record, but it too is elevated at 69.09% versus the historical average of 56.45%. That means that of the companies that have reported earnings over the past three months, a massive proportion are exceeding consensus sales and EPS estimates.\n\n&gt; While earnings beat rates have continued to grind higher, economic data is another story. The Citi Economic Surprise Index basically tracks macroeconomic data and how it comes in relative to forecasts. Higher readings indicate the data is trending stronger than expected and vice versa for negative readings. With the unprecedented shock to macroeconomic data in 2020, this index for the United States plummeted, but that was followed by a sharp rebound to record highs. Although the index for the US remains higher than anything prior to the pandemic, it has been heading lower since the summer. In other words, economic data is still coming in better than expected but is not massively exceeding expectations to the degree it was back in the spring and early summer.\n\n&gt; The two charts below compare EPS and revenue beat rates to the Citi Economic Surprise Index. Comparing the two series to the Citi Economic Surprise Index shows that while EPS beat rate has been somewhat connected (correlation: +0.325)) there is very little in the way of correlation between the Surprise Index and the revenue beat rate (+0.084). Given that EPS figures are typically easier to massage than revenues, that was a bit of a surprise. What is notable about the recent decline in the Citi Economic Surprise Index is that in prior periods where it became elevated and then pulled back as it did in (2003, 2009, and 2018), the EPS beat rate typically didn't peak and start to trend lower for another few months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102820-Citi-vs-Earn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/qOJdagC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/9KQPNXR.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pj7pysD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/h2HgKHB.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/DRjtGSM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.3.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aoPSp6k.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BKnNZhJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/97DJGA7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4k28zp5.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/lb9tHJr.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/i7l5LTf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8prHmLC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/jlZMuyc.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Xs5XIA3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/WX3Qbv9.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/kI5jFhr.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/u6ZNU50.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.6.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aP1LaQn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.6.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/k3lJ7Qz.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # PayPal $186.13\n**PayPal (PYPL)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:15 PM ET on Monday, November 2, 2020.

So maybe the pandemic pulled forward a lot of user growth into the two prior quarters.\n\nTwitter is an essential platform for news, but there's also a lot of other good content on there.  Art, business, sports, self-help, etc. So you can get a lot of good value from Twitter, as a user, without getting into the vitriolic political and news topics.  I think Twitter should play up this aspect to attract more people.  \n\nTwitter has a small fraction of the users that FB has.  But to me that just means there is a ton of room for growth.  So, if you think the platform is worthwhile, then it's just a question of executing the right plan to add users.  I think this is something they'll figure out.\n\nI also think they could do a better job of targeting ads.  When I use twitter, I see tons of ads for stuff I am absolutely not interested in.  It doesn't seem to me that they target their ads near as well as FB.  Has anyone else noticed this?  I think there's room for improvement here, that could eventually lead to better revenue and profit.  \n\nSo I own some twitter stock because I see value in the platform.  Its market cap is small in comparison to its influence.  There is room for improvement in the areas I mentioned above.  So I think I'm holding for now but if anyone has a critique of my thinking I'd be interested in hearing it.\n\nThanks.",

      "selftext": " \n\n# \n\nWe all understand the basics of trend. Higher highs/lows and lower highs/lower lows. In my opinion, no trade should ever be taken without having a complete understanding of the trend you're in on the important time frames (4hr to monthly). A bad habit we have all had at one point is the tendency to focus in on 1 or 2 time frames. I see a lot of traders here who talk about how they trade off the 5 min exclusively or just the 1 min chart. This is a recipe for disaster. When you're not shifting up to a higher time frame to understand trend you will get burned. You might even nail the trend on the 1 hour chart, but on the 2 hour chart the trend could tell a different story. See an example below. We made a new low on the 1 hour chart. Following our understanding of trend, we can then assume that a lower high short is going to be in play. We short the swing that we cant close above (this would be a higher high and we would get stopped out) and we end up getting stopped out and price goes higher. We are then left confused on how we made a new high even though we just made a new low. Should we be in a downtrend if we are making new lows? What we should've done before taking the lower high short on the 1 hour is shift up a time frame to confirm the trend. Look at the 2 hour and see if we made a new low. On the 2 hour chart we wicked below the previous low but ended up closing higher than the previous low (it is all about the closes, a wick below and a body close above the prior low is a higher low). The trend on the 1 hour was down (lower low) and the trend on the 2 hour was a higher low.). Which one do we base our decision on whether to take the short on? The answer in most cases is the higher time frame. In the example below we ended up making new highs and this is because of the higher low on the more important time frame. This is often one of the most overlooked aspects of understanding trend. You must take into consideration more than one time frame (preferably all of them) when trading. Just looking at a 1 min chart is going to tell you nothing about the trend. I will share a couple more examples of lower lows on the weekly chart that were actually higher lows on the monthly. The lower lows on the weekly would have been signaling lower highs and the higher low on the monthly would have been signaling higher highs. The higher time frame will be the timeframe that we base our decision on and we wont take a short and instead look for longs!\n\nExample 1: NQ\n\n1 hour: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/i3ywaF9H/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/i3ywaF9H/)\n\n2 hour: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/WYIAlFqp/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WYIAlFqp/)\n\nResult: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/cQduKidm/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/cQduKidm/)\n\nExample 2: Apple\n\nWeekly: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/zyu50IlO/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zyu50IlO/)\n\nMonthly: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/tTKIx2ji/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tTKIx2ji/)\n\nResult: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/IVbotR5q/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/IVbotR5q/)\n\nExample 3: NQ\n\n4 hour: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/PVoc7WEa/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PVoc7WEa/)\n\nDaily: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/rtUUgaar/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/rtUUgaar/)\n\nResult: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/Nyv5wfLt/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Nyv5wfLt/)",

I mean they are selfsufficient in itself. ad revenue. games revenue etc, but whole market right now is on halt due to corona and people would want to keep their money or invest in something more appeling then stocks. I mean i can be surely wrong but why would you pump money in the market in the urcentan times and many people without work and small bussines closed due to lock downs. If economy slows downs, markets also will slow down. Some bilionares out there can hold stocks high, but how long is it for them sustainable as they will get less money from holding longer then before?  \n\n\ni dont want market to go down, but i cant wrap my head around why it would rise and why more people would pump into it? If its better to hold cash for them until it settles down and pump back with more support.
