All the information I express is what I was able to gather from Airbnb\u2019s submission to the SEC. The truth is I was waiting for this IPO for a long time, and it is surely the most important IPO of 2020. The IPO is going to take place in December without a clear date being published and will be listed as (NASDAQ:ABNB). I will be covering the following matters:\n\u2022 Company\u2019s Overview\n\u2022 The impact of the coronavirus \u2013 Financials\n\u2022 Competitors \u2013 WHAT DISTINGUISH Airbnb from them\n\u2022 Risk factors to consider\n\u2022 Safeguards to consider\nCompany\u2019s overview\nAirbnb is a vacation rental online business, that allows people worldwide to find places to stay either for travelling purposes, or business purposes. It is used for short-term stays meaning a temporary accommodation. It was founded in 2008 and has its headquarters in San Francisco, California, United States. It has more than 7 million homes listed, and it operates in 100,000 cities. Does Airbnb own the properties listed? No, it doesn\u2019t own any of them, in fact people like you and me that have a residential home can list it on Airbnb after successfully complying with its rules. This helps the homeowners to achieve higher occupancy rates since it gives them \u201cautomatic advertising\u201d when they appear on the searches without them having to spend money on advertising. Of course, Airbnb doesn\u2019t do that for free! It charges them a 14 - 16% whereas in some other cases 20% to those who offer experiences and this fee is deducted from the hosts payout. This fee can vary from country to country. \nImpressive how such a \u201csimple\u201d idea \u2013 two friends renting their house to help them pay their rent, twelve years later turned into a business worth $18 billion. Before the coronavirus pandemic Airbnb was worth $38 billion.\nCoronavirus pandemic impact on Airbnb - Financials\nI believe that from now on the Covid-19 impact on any business is very important to be mention for a thoroughly comparison of what it used to be and what may be again. According to Airbnb\u2019s reports, in 2019 there was an increase of 32% $4.8 billion in its revenue and a 29% increase in the bookings to $29.4 billion. However, 2020 didn\u2019t seem to be a good year considering the virus, revenues faced a decline of 32% to $2.5 billion and its bookings fell by 39% to $18 billion.\nNeedless to say, that the net losses from 2018 to 2019 have seen a huge rise from $17 million in 2018 to $674 million by the end of 2019. Pandemic widened these losses even more for 2020 accumulating at $697 million losses until September 2020. The total deficit was $2.1 billion as of September 30,2020.\nThese numbers are surely causing you to reconsider your investment in Airbnb so to spread your hopes up again Reuters estimates a valuation raise to $30 billion. Not to forget that Airbnb was valued $31 million in 2017 which is nothing to what it is valued now after the pandemic. In general, This IPO hopes to reverse this decline.\nCompetitors\nSince Airbnb falls under the booking market, I need to highlight the many rivals it has since this is a small barrier business to entry.\n1.Unlike Airbnb, Expedia group (EXPE) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) have both reported a steady earning report that shows operating profits increasing year by year.\n2.HomeAway (AWAY) does not charge a fee for each booking like Airbnb does, and its only asking for an annually $350 to advertise the property. Meaning leaving the hosts with much more profits than Airbnb.\n3. Trip Advisor (TRIP) which is a rival, reported a much smaller revenue compared to Airbnb accumulating $156 million in 2019.\n\nWhat distinguish it from its competitors?\nThe company\u2019s advantage over its competitors is surely visible for the following reasons:\n1. Airbnb is 3 times bigger than Trip Advisor\nTrip Advisor might be a competitor, but Airbnb has an advantage over it if you compare the sizes which means Airbnb does not have to worry about it, at least for now.\n2. Airbnb has a rapid growth\nComparing the percentage changes, Airbnb has proved to be growing almost 10 times faster than Booking Holdings and 5 times fast than Expedia Group.\n3. Airbnb is very liquid\nThe term liquidity means that a company holds available funds in the bank. According to Bloomberg it holds $2 billion cash in the bank which means it can help it overcome the losses and the negative events that bother their way.\n\nRisk factors to consider:\nBefore the vaccine I would have definitely say third wave of Coronavirus, but after the vaccine news I am personally very positive that all this will be a history soon, but this is a different article.\n1. The regulations for short-term rentals are becoming stricter.\nAirbnb grew because of the non-existing regulations of short-term rentals, but after this rapidly growing business things became more apparent. There have been some incidences from hosts discriminating guests, blaming guests for damages, misleading them from the pictures, even some parties going on causing police engagement. But like Uber, Airbnb it\u2019s just a technology platform connecting hosts with guests. Bottom line, it can be very difficult to come up with regulations in all cities and regions which give Airbnb space to breath.\n2. The competition becomes bigger.\nOther online booking services like, Booking Holdings (BNKG) that provides the same service. In addition, Expedia (EXPE) bought Home Away (AWAY) few years ago and raised competition. Likewise, a French hospitality Accor bought short-term rental One Fine Stay and Marriot International (MAR) partnered with home rental platform Hostmaker to provide short-term rentals. As it seems Airbnb changed the game for hotels and pushed them to pursue other strategies which points how strong of a player is.\n3. Airbnb does not have a clear path of profitability.\nIn fact, Airbnb has not ever generated profit, and this is something big to consider. All this together seem to shadow Airbnb\u2019s future. But, with the IPO going on, and the available cash in the bank there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel.\nSafeguards to consider:\n1. The hotel sector has proved to be far more \u201cdestroyed\u201d from Covid-19 than Airbnb which keeps it in a strong IPO position. Did you know that as of December 31, 2019 72% of 327 million Airbnb nights were booked by individual hosts? In other words, 92 million nights were listed under professional hosts by Airbnb. Moreover, Marriot International had 1.38 million rooms meaning almost 67 nights of full occupancy. Would these guests stayed there and keep Marriott\u2019s properties full if it wasn\u2019t for Airbnb? I don\u2019t think so.\n2. Recently, Bill Gates expressed his opinion on how the business travel will drop 50%. This can be very bad for hotels, but what about Airbnb? Because of the way everyone travels today, using online bookings and seeking to pay less for the maximum luxury, it makes it harder for hotels to beat the industry and especially Airbnb.\nMy Opinion\nInvestors need to consider all possible factors to form their decision. There is not a final price for the stock going IPO. At the end of the day is all a belief and since people will \u201cvalue\u201d it on the market I believe they will give it quite a high value at least in the long term. It is on my personal portfolio list, since the world is on track for a coronavirus free world.\nDisclaimer: It is only an opinion and should not be taken as a financial advice.", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 931433, "public", "self", "Is Airbnb a stock you should invest in?", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k247b8/is_airbnb_a_stock_you_should_invest_in/", "all_ads", 6, 1606490617.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Napolitano_", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8qiouebw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606494217, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k247b8/is_airbnb_a_stock_you_should_invest_in/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k247b8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/k247b8/is_airbnb_a_stock_you_should_invest_in/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1606494228, "score": 1, "selftext": "Bullish\nIn this article I will explain why this is a good investment through my own eyes.

As the coronavirus decimated travel around the world, the company [raised $2 billion in new debt funding](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/14/airbnb-raises-another-1-billion-in-debt.html) at a valuation of $18 billion and announced major cost-cutting initiatives, including plans to [lay off 25% of its staff](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/05/airbnb-to-lay-off-nearly-1900-people-25percent-of-company.html), or nearly 1,900 employees. The company also slashed marketing costs and raised billions of dollars in debt.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic brought the travel industry to a halt, resulting in an estimated $443 billion of lost revenue since the beginning of March,\u00a0according to\u00a0[a Nov. 5 report](https://www.ustravel.org/sites/default/files/media_root/document/Coronavirus_WeeklyImpacts_11.5.20.pdf?utm_source=MagnetMail&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=11%2E5%2E20%20%2D%20COVID%20Research%20Weekly&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ust)\u00a0from the U.S. Travel Association.\n\nAirbnb rebounded, however, after\u00a0[a surge of rentals in rural areas](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/06/rural-airbnb-bookings-are-surging-as-vacationers-look-to-escape-the-coronavirus.html)\u00a0as residents with means fled pandemic-stricken cities.\u00a0The rebound began within two months of the pandemic, the company said in its prospectus.\n\n\u201cIn early 2020, as\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0disrupted travel across the world, Airbnb\u2019s business declined significantly,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cBut within two months, our business model started to rebound even with limited international travel, demonstrating its resilience.

Despite the race being to close to call, last night, President Trump falsely declared victory while simultaneously questioning the veracity of the election process, due to the ongoing count of mail-in ballots. Trump indicated that he was willing to challenge attempts by states to keep counting ballots after election night, despite it being well known that the surge in mail-in ballots would cause complications and slow counting. \u201cWe\u2019ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The presidential race is extremely close, with a number of consequential battle states, like Pennsylvania and Nevada unlikely to produce results until at least tomorrow. The flurry of news made for a volatile overnight session, that at one point saw the Nasdaq futures spike from being slightly down to over 4% up. \n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 3.85% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 2.18% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished the day 1.35% up.\n\nAs of this afternoon, according to the Associated Press, Joe Biden has 248 electoral votes to Pres. Trump\u2019s 214. Candidates need 270 votes to win. However, because of the surge in mail-in ballots this election due to the pandemic, counting the votes is expected to take longer than normal. Despite the race being to close to call, last night, President Trump falsely declared victory while simultaneously questioning the veracity of the election process, due to the ongoing count of mail-in ballots. Trump indicated that he was willing to challenge attempts by states to keep counting ballots after election night, despite it being well known that the surge in mail-in ballots would cause complications and slow counting. \u201cWe\u2019ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop,\u201d Trump said to a crowd of supporters at the White House. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to find any ballots ... and add them to the list. We\u2019re were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign has suggested it would be willing to fight Trump in court.\n\nJoe Biden also too expressed confidence that the vote would go his way. \u201cWe feel good about where we are. We really do. I\u2019m here to tell you tonight we believe we\u2019re on track to win this election.\u201d\n\nIn the Senate elections, the so-called \u201cblue wave\u201d many pundits predicted did not happen. As of this morning, Democrats only managed a net gain of one seat, whereas they needed at least three to establish a majority. Democrats missed opportunities to flip seats where they could. South Carolina and Montana were rated toss-ups, and Texas was only rated slightly Republican. If Democrats broke through in one or more of those races, it would have likely portended a good night for them. Instead, Republicans appear to have won all of them handily:\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* California voters carried Uber and Lyft to victory, overwhelmingly approving Proposition 22, a ballot measure that allows gig economy companies to continue treating drivers as independent contractors. Uber, Lyft, and the delivery service DoorDash designed the measure to exempt the companies from a state labor law that would have forced them to employ drivers and pay for health care, unemployment insurance, and other benefits. As a concession to labor advocates, the initiative offers a wage floor and limited benefits to drivers.\n* Health-care stocks led in the 30-stock Dow, with UnitedHealth Group rallying 9% and Amgen up more than 6%.

The pandemic has clearly had a huge impact on the company. However, recently Booking has witnessed a recovery in its business. Newly booked room nights have steadily improved, from 15% of their normal level in April to 65% of their normal level in July.\n\nThe company has reinforced their liquidity with $10.5 billion of cash compared to $11.5 billion of debt and cash flow is almost neutral (usually +$5 billion). Consequently the company appears surefooted.\n\nThe valuation meanwhile is still down 20% from 2018 highs and trading on just 18x last years earnings.

It also makes industrial automation equipment (9%), including collaborative and mobile robots.\n\nThe medium term outlook for testing is strong with the widespread roll out of 5G and suppressed demand expected to be released from Auto and Industry. Chief Executive Mark Jagiela said \"Entering Q4, market conditions in our test businesses are stronger than expected and we've positioned our production capacity to respond to potential short lead time demands as we move through the quarter.\"\n\nThe trailing PE of 23.55 looks attractive given the expected medium term outperformance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn **Thursday** Align jumped 35% after reporting knock out earnings as the CEO credited the \u201cZoom effect\u201d for making people more aware of their crooked smiles.

Specifically he discussed the company's approach to transforming mental healthcare, using psilocybin, the active ingredient in psychedelic, or \"magic\" mushrooms.\n\nThe company is currently in Phase 2b of its clinical trials, where the efficacy of the treatment is tested. Goldsmith also noted that the treatment has received breakthrough therapy designation from the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA), allowing it to expedite the development and review of the therapy. \n\nIn addition to the U.S., the UK-based company is doing clinical trials in eight other countries. The company expects to complete and report on its Phase 2b trials at the end of 2021, Goldsmith said in the interview. \n\nCompass initially plans to use its psilocybin therapy for patients with treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, addiction and other mental illnesses. The treatment combines the use of the psychoactive substance with trained therapist psychological support.\n\nWith 3.4 million sufferers, we get a $4 billion total addressable market if we assume 15% penetration and $8,000 cost.  Compass\u2019 $1.3 billion market cap looks cheap in comparison.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, my favorite story this week.  On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne maintained a Hold rating on Liberty Broadband $LBRDK and set a price target of $174.00. That\u2019s below the analyst consensus of a Moderate Buy with an average price target of $183.33 but enough above the current $140 to make it interesting.\n\nLiberty Broadband was created in September 2014 when Liberty Media spun off its cable businesses into a new unit. It was a typically complex arrangement by to avoid tax liabilities but the important part is that LBRDK ended up holding a 25% stake in Charter Communications $CHTR. Then, in May 2016, Charter acquired both Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, quadrupling the number of customers and becoming the second-largest cable company in the US after Comcast.\n\nCharter is now trading at around $592, so Liberty\u2019s original investment is worth $35 billion. That is interesting because LBRDK\u2019s other assets and liabilities are fairly trivial and the $35 billion asset offers a striking premium to the current market cap of $25 billion.\n\nImportantly there are a couple of catalysts here that should drive these two values together. The Liberty group is taking steps to simplify its structure with the merger of GCI Liberty and Liberty Broadband. That will reduce some overhead costs and allow cross shareholdings to be collapsed in a tax efficient manner. Secondly, LBRDK announced an expansion of its buyback program from $200 million to $1.2billion, citing the widening discount to NAV.\n\nThese measures may not be enough by themselves to drive these two values together but show that management is now addressing the issue. In the meantime shareholders get to hold a stake in Charter at a discount. Not bad given the $CHTR stock has performed well  (up 20% over 12 months) and could well have further to run. Cable is still one of the dominant / most efficient broadband technologies today and CHTR's management team is regarded as one of the most experienced teams in the cable industry. Additionally, the impact of COVID has been immaterial and the stock is up 10% since February.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cFollow\u201d me to get updates and links during the week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.

The S&amp;P (SPY) fell 0.63%, and the Dow Jones finished the day 0.53% down.\n\nToday, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin admitted that coming to a deal regarding stimulus and advancing the measure through Congress would be \u201cdifficult\u201d before the November election. The remarks come shortly after Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi met on the phone to negotiate further, a deal Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson called \u201cproductive\u201d. The two are set to discuss again tomorrow, but after multiple weeks of discussion and the November election coming ever-nearer, chances for additional stimulus look dim. \n\nThe impasse between US lawmakers over stimulus is alarming, given the frequent calls of Pres. Trump, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members, and economist for more virus-relief. Yesterday, Senate Leader Mitch McConnel said he would introduce a smaller, more targeted proposal to the Senate when the chamber reconvenes next Monday. He said \u201cWhen the full Senate returns on October 19th, our first order of business will be voting again on targeted relief for American workers, including new funding for the PPP.\u201d The estimated $500 billion deal is way below the $1.8 trillion package proposed by the White House earlier in the week, a sign that negotiations may be souring. However, Pelosi has made it clear she would not support smaller, targeted bills, calling them inadequate. Pres. Trump appears to agree with her, tweeting \u201cGo big or go home!!!\u201d for more stimulus. \n\nIn other news, two companies in the forefront of vaccine development for the coronavirus announced their respective trials were put on trial over safety concerns. Eli Lilly (LLY) said Tuesday afternoon that enrollment for its COVID-19 treatment would be temporarily halted, less than a day after Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) said clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate were paused due to an unexplained illness in a participant. Shares of Eli Lilly and Johnson &amp; Johnson were little changed overnight after dropping during Tuesday\u2019s session.\n\nIn terms of earnings season, all eyes are on big banks as they have already started to report. An article published by Marketbeat summarized sentiment by stating that \u201cJPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America saw their profits partly recover in the third quarter from the depths of the coronavirus-caused recession earlier this year.
