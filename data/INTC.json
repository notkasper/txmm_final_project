The New York-based fund has amassed a nearly $1 billion stake in Intel, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nLoeb said in the letter that Intel's most urgent task was addressing its \"human capital management issue\", as many of its talented chip designers have fled, \"demoralized by the status quo\".\n\nIntel has lost its pole position in microprocessor manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Loeb wrote in the letter.\n\nIntel is also losing market share in its core PC and data center markets to Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Loeb added. NVIDIA Corp is dominating computational models used in artificial intelligence applications, while Intel has been largely absent in this nascent market, according to the letter.\n\n\"Without immediate change at Intel, we fear that America's access to leading-edge semiconductor supply will erode, forcing the U.S. to rely more heavily on a geopolitically unstable East Asia to power everything from PCs to data centers to critical infrastructure and more,\" Loeb wrote.\n\nIntel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLoeb asked Intel to retain an investment advisor to evaluate strategic alternatives, according to the letter. Third Point believes that Intel should consider separating its chip design from its semiconductor fabrication plant manufacturing operations, according to the sources. This could include a joint venture in manufacturing, according to the sources.\n\nIntel customers, such as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc, are developing their own in-house silicon solutions and sending those designs to be manufactured in East Asia, Loeb wrote.

The New York-based fund has amassed a nearly $1 billion stake in Intel, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nLoeb said in the letter that Intel's most urgent task was addressing its \"human capital management issue\", as many of its talented chip designers have fled, \"demoralized by the status quo\".\n\nIntel has lost its pole position in microprocessor manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Loeb wrote in the letter.\n\nIntel is also losing market share in its core PC and data center markets to Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Loeb added. NVIDIA Corp is dominating computational models used in artificial intelligence applications, while Intel has been largely absent in this nascent market, according to the letter.\n\n\"Without immediate change at Intel, we fear that America's access to leading-edge semiconductor supply will erode, forcing the U.S. to rely more heavily on a geopolitically unstable East Asia to power everything from PCs to data centers to critical infrastructure and more,\" Loeb wrote.\n\nIntel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLoeb asked Intel to retain an investment advisor to evaluate strategic alternatives, according to the letter. Third Point believes that Intel should consider separating its chip design from its semiconductor fabrication plant manufacturing operations, according to the sources. This could include a joint venture in manufacturing, according to the sources.\n\nIntel customers, such as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc, are developing their own in-house silicon solutions and sending those designs to be manufactured in East Asia, Loeb wrote. He suggested Intel must offer new solutions to retain these customers rather than have them send their manufacturing away.\n\nThird Point, which has $15 billion in assets under management, has experience in pushing companies to pursue deals, including at Prudential Plc, Yum!

Over the last few years, we\u2019ve initiated a transition from being a PC-centric company to a data-centric one and expanded our product offerings in order to seize new market opportunities.\u00a0\n\n&gt; By focusing on our four strategic priorities \u2013 accelerating the growth of the company, improving our execution, thoughtfully deploying our capital and evolving our culture \u2013 we can have a larger impact on our customers\u2019 success.\n\nMy $70c april 2021 already printed 250% profit from premium. \n\nNow I'm in $55c 01/21/22 long\n\n&gt; 2024 Total Addressable Market: ~$300B\n\n&gt; Based on our analytics, we anticipate a total addressable market (TAM) of nearly $300 billion by the year 2024. In addition to this TAM, we also see opportunities beyond silicon in areas like software and services.\n\nThe memes and kiddy investors think Intel is going down so the IV is low and premiums are at a good price. The bears are always wrong about tech stocks. They think intel is some kind of shitty company that doesn't have the worlds leading market movers invested in their success, I dont know maybe I'm wrong about their thoughts. I can't read their minds but I can read Intels press releases and figures.\n\nNews like this about AI, maybe it's not gaming performance but that's not what we are here to talk about:\n\n&gt; Intel Announces Unmatched AI and Analytics Platform with New Processor, Memory, Storage and FPGA Solutions\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-announces-unmatched-ai-analytics-platform-new-processor-memory-storage-fpga/#gs.n7nrs7\n\n&gt; Why It\u2019s Important:\u00a0AI and analytics open new opportunities for customers across a broad range of industries, including finance, healthcare, industrial, telecom and transportation. IDC predicts that by 2021, 75% of commercial enterprise apps will use AI1. And by 2025, IDC estimates that roughly a quarter of all data generated will be created in real time, with various internet of things (IoT) devices creating 95% of that volume growth2.\n\nThey have their hands in Machine Learning, AI, neuroscience and self driving cars...\n\n&gt; Spotlight: Big Bets\n&gt; To be at the forefront of the constant technological change in our industry, we must evaluate new and existing big bets based on the following criteria: the \u201cbet\u201d is leading the edge of a technology inflection, it plays a significant role in our customers\u2019 success, and it offers a clear path to profitability and attractive returns. Our current big bets are memory, autonomous driving, and 5G.\n\nI don't see any reason to logically remain skeptical of Intels consistent year to year performance and market adaptations.\n\nINTC leaps to the moon\n\nEnjoy the new car or house.\n\nHere are the necessary edits I had to include in the post that are responses to trolls, if anyone wants more info and meme defense: \n\nEdit because trolls:\n\nLook at the greeks of the contract if you know how to read them. They are good for this strike price. \n\nIt is a safe and profitable bet with the delta and vega ratings. A 10% increase in the underlying would put it past strike price and net several hundred % return on investment. \n\nI'm sorry if I'm \"casting pearls before swine\" and this is all going everyone's heads like my [$6 ITM PLTR calls I posted last month.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jh2njz/get_in_on_this_while_you_can_pltr_6_itm_call_you/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) But let's stop playing dumb ok? Let's make money.\n\nAlso: because so many people say \"AMD BEat IntEl hurrdprorpdr\" ... The success of AMD in PC gaming doesnt negate Intel's success everywhere else:\n\n&gt; At Intel, our\u00a0strategy is to deliver the world\u2019s best semiconductors for an increasingly data-centric world. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve initiated a transition from being a PC-centric company to a data-centric one and expanded our product offerings in order to seize new market opportunities.\u00a0\n\nI'm long AMD, INTC, TSM, and NVDA.\n\nThey all will go up.

The ETFs listed below are outsized positions and vary from long term to super long term and I will unlikely touch them since I am a perma bull.\n\nRegardless, I do *feel* what we are about to enter as a nation is going to be shockingly bad. Like 1918 bad. There will be no debate on masks and quarantine by January. This is my estimation (as a front line medical professional) regardless of Pfizer's news today. There will be no stopping the deaths that will likely be over 1000 per day in rural previously unaffected (or minimally affected) parts of the nation.

Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus \n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until \u201cat least 2023\u201d. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed\u2019s monetary support. In early October, Powell said, \u201ctoo little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000. While this estimate would the sixth month of net payroll gains, it would also be the four, straight month of deceleration, indicating the pace of recovery is slowing. The unemployment rate is also predicted to tick lower, from 7.9% to 7.6%. However, worryingly, there appears to be a trend towards long-term unemployment for many Americans. The number of individuals filing continuing claims, people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, has continued to increase the past several weeks. This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly.\n\nThe US just set a new record for the highest seven-day average of daily new cases: 81,336 as of Sunday. That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has increased only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project. \n\nLast week, Europe recorded around 1.5 million new cases of coronavirus, a new record, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. England, in response to the surge, announced a nationwide lockdown for at least the next four weeks.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday an event for Nov. 10 where it\u2019s expected to announce new Macs that are powered by their own chips powered by ARM processors, instead of the Intel chips it had been using.

NIO delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, doubling from a year ago. The result is doubly impressive because NIO very recently raised its manufacturing capacity to 5,000 vehicles a month. The company is selling all the cars it can make. This stock is an absolute monster and is one we love at PsychoTrader!\n* Alibaba (BABA), is doubling its Singles\u2019 Day offerings this year, running the massive online sales event across two periods rather than one. Alibaba says it expanded the shopping window for Singles\u2019 Day to provide more relief for merchants that have been hit hard by the pandemic.

According to Fortune Magazine, BABA shipped $38.4 billion in gross merchandise value on Singles\u2019 Day last year. Amazon\u2019s Prime Day, by comparison, sold around $6 billion in goods last year.\n* Asian shares were mostly higher on Monday buoyed by further signs of recovery in China's manufacturing sector.

Though Pelosi\u2019s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is \u201coptimistic\u201d about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.\n\nDespite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell\u2019s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump\u2019s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.\n\nIn other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans\u2019 attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in \u201call-or-nothing obstruction\u201d as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she \u201chas a prospect for an agreement\u201d with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. \u201cThere will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent \u2014 my goal \u2014 or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.\u201d It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Snapchat (SNAP) rocketed up today after posting better than expected quarterly earnings report.

The money will go to opioid treatment and abatement programs. DEA Assistant Administrator Tim McDermott said, \u201cPurdue Pharma actively thwarted the US\u2019 efforts to ensure compliance and prevent diversions. The devastating ripple effect of Purdue\u2019s actions left lives lost and others addicted.\u201d This is one of the most significant blows dealt by the US government against the opioid epidemic. \n* Nokia (NOK) and Greener Acres Canada disclosed on Wednesday an agreement to upgrade Canada's utility pole infrastructure to smart, eco-friendly poles across the country.\n* Renewable energy giant Iberdrola, through its U.S. subsidiary Avangrid, will acquire PNM Resources (PNM) which is New Mexico\u2019s largest utility.

White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.\n\nDespite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell\u2019s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump\u2019s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.\n\nIn other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans\u2019 attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in \u201call-or-nothing obstruction\u201d as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she \u201chas a prospect for an agreement\u201d with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. \u201cThere will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent \u2014 my goal \u2014 or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.\u201d It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Snapchat (SNAP) rocketed up today after posting better than expected quarterly earnings report.

That slide was the longest losing streak for the averages since mid-September. The two market benchmarks eked out slight gains on Friday to snap their losing streak.\n*****\n&gt; Investors and traders expect this choppy trading action to continue, especially as the worsening coronavirus data and a lack of U.S. coronavirus stimulus draw attention away from a strong earnings season thus far.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe combination of no stimulus, fading economic momentum, and the threat of rising coronavirus cases, creates a rather negative dynamic for risk assets right now,\u201d said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; The seven-day average of new daily coronavirus infections has risen in 39 states, including New York, New Jersey and Wisconsin, according to a CNBC analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University and the U.S. Census Bureau. At the nationwide level, the rate of new daily cases is at its highest level since August.\n*****\n&gt; In Europe, the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases has surpassed that of the U.S., leading several countries in the region to reinstate tougher social distancing rules and roll back previous reopening measures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat this means is economic activity may slow down a bit, and we\u2019ve already started to see some of that in the data,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, noting the weekly jobless claims numbers released Thursday show they\u2019ve reached a point where \u201cthey\u2019re not going to get better; they\u2019re going to get worse.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Labor Department said initial U.S. jobless claims hit their highest level since August, reaching 898,000 in the week ending Oct. 10.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also keep their eyes on Washington during the week ahead as lawmakers continue to struggle over new U.S. fiscal stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; # Political posturing on stimulus \u2018hurting\u2019 those in need\n&gt; This week, President Donald Trump said he would raise his offer for a coronavirus aid above the current level of $1.8 trillion. The White House\u2019s current offer is smaller than a $2.2 trillion package passed by the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said the administration\u2019s proposal \u201cfalls significantly short\u201d of what is needed.\n*****\n&gt; This back and forth between the two parties has dwindled expectations among market participants of a compromise being reached before the Nov. 3 election. It has also added to the concerns surrounding the U.S. economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis political posturing is hurting that cohort of the economy that needs help the most,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cTo the small and mid-size business owner, the airlines, this is not just about politics; this is every day life. There going to be an impact in the real economy if we don\u2019t see something now.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings season ignored?\n&gt; Those talks over further stimulus are also expected to divert attention away from the corporate earnings season, which began this week but had next to no impact on the broader market.\n*****\n&gt; Procter &amp; Gamble, Netflix, Travelers, American Airlines and American Express are among the companies slated to report next week.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and VF Corp. are among the 49 S&amp;P 500 companies that posted their latest quarterly results this week. Of those 49 companies, 86% reported better-than-expected earnings, according to data from The Earnings Scout.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI wish I could say that next week we\u2019re going to put aside the politics and the Covid concerns behind us, but we won\u2019t trade this earnings season,\u201d said Hogan of National Securities. \u201cWhile it will likely be a record-breaking season for companies beating estimates, it\u2019s also going to be one that is largely ignored because there\u2019re so many other macro factors that are more important.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There is also some important housing data in the week ahead, including home builders\u2019 sentiment Monday, housing starts Tuesday, and existing home sales Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe housing market is still off to the races,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe mortgage applications were strong, suggesting very strong activity in the month of September.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said the market will eventually cool when interest rates begin to rise.

Then in a big move higher over the past two weeks, many stocks moved from oversold to overbought in a very quick timeframe.\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, more than 90% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 were beneath their 10-day moving average on September 24 and within two weeks saw more than 90% above this short-term trend line. This type of buying thrust is consistent with future strong returns, suggests quick reversals from oversold to overbought are a good thing, and could bode well for stocks to outperform bonds well into 2021.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Parts of the economy are opening back up, while employment continues to disappoint. One specific area that continues to improve is how many people are flying, as the seven-day average number of travelers going through Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints hit a new recovery high. We discuss other high-frequency data points in our COVID Surge Stalling Europe\u2019s Recovery blog.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve noted before that stock market gains ahead of the election historically support the incumbent party, while if stocks are lower it tends to support new leadership in the White House. Taking this further, the US dollar also tends to send signals for who might win. In fact, when stocks are up and the US dollar is lower ahead of the election, or if stocks are lower and the US dollar is higher before an election, the results have accurately predicted the last seven times those scenarios took place. Given stocks are up and the US dollar is slightly lower, this could be one clue the upcoming election will be much closer than many are expecting.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Sticking with the election, many investors are worried about higher taxes and more deregulation if former Vice President Joe Biden wins. \u201cHigher taxes may be one part of it, but Biden is also looking at huge spending initiatives,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cStock markets like spending, and this could more than help offset potentially higher taxes.\u201d Lower tariffs could potentially provide another offset as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, Friday\u2019s retail sales report came in better than expected, marking five consecutive months of year-over-year gains. It is worth noting the economy has never been in a recession after 4 or more consecutive monthly gains. Still, in the face of one of the most severe recessions ever, it took only a few months for sales to get back to new highs, as shown below. Historically, new highs in retail sales happen in expansions\u2014and this is yet another clue the recession is likely over.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Record Surge In Business Formations As Economy Recovers From COVID\n\n&gt; Yesterday the Census updated business formation stats for Q3, and as indicated by high-frequency data from the Atlanta Fed, business formation exploded in Q3. As shown in the first chart below, total business applications rocketed upwards by 1.57 million, a record increase. Stripping out businesses that are unlikely to result in hiring, the numbers are much smaller in absolute terms but still rose 79% to a record pace. Finally, applications for businesses with planned wages surged 70% from a record low in Q2, to the highest levels since 2008.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101520-Biz-Apps.png))**\n\n&gt; In all three instances, the recent behavior is a complete reversal of the post-Financial Crisis period, when the prolonged recession led to a huge decline in business starts. That\u2019s a good sign for the breadth of the economic rebound, as business formation tends to lead to higher productivity thanks to more innovation and investment.

Tips - Retail Sales Rebound\n\n&gt; After a disappointment last month, Retail Sales saw a nice rebound in September as consumers seem undeterred from spending despite the expiration of extended UI benefits and the lack of an additional stimulus bill. For the month of September, headline Retail Sales rose 1.9% m/m versus expectations for a more modest increase of 0.8%. Ex Autos and Gas, growth was even better relative to expectations, although August\u2019s already slower than expected growth was revised modestly lower.\n\n&gt; Breadth in this month\u2019s report was strong. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but one of them (Electronics and Appliances) showed growth. Normally, when a sector shows m/m growth of a percent or two, it\u2019s impressive. This month, though, the volatility of the pandemic remains in place as two sectors showed growth of over 5%, including Clothing which saw double-digit growth relative to August!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/sectors1016.png))**\n\n&gt; While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # University of Michigan Mixed Again\n\n&gt; The University of Michigan reported preliminary consumer sentiment numbers for October. University of Michigan data has shown a much smaller bounce than other sentiment surveys, but the preliminary numbers for October did increase versus September. The strongest part of the survey was expectations, which has risen three months in a row to the highest levels since March. Consumers' current assessment of the economy fell sequentially and is sitting at about the same place it was back in early 2012.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101620-Michigan.png))**\n\n&gt; One feature of the University of Michigan poll with incomplete data prior to 2016 but more complete data since is a breakout of economic sentiment by political party affiliation. As shown below, their data shows Republicans getting a massive sentiment boost in the wake of the 2016 election. The key here though, is that the boost to the sentiment of Republicans and the decline for Democrats came after the election as this data is definitely lagging to political outcomes rather than leading.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101620-Michigan-Part.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Smiles\n\n&gt; Sentiment among small businesses continued to improve in the month of September according to the NFIB's monthly Small Business Optimism Index. As shown below, the index rose 3.8 points to 104 which is now just half of a point below the levels prior to the pandemic in February. That was also better than expectations of a smaller improvement to 101.2. Small business sentiment has now risen in four of the past five months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; In the table below, we break down this month's report by each of the ten components of the headline number as well as the many other indices included in the report such as those not used as inputs to the headline number and what small businesses are reporting to be their biggest problems.\n\n&gt; Across all indices of the September report, breadth was solid with only a couple of indices falling month over month\u2014Expected Credit Conditions and Credit Conditions Availability. Some of those that were higher saw record or near-record month-over-month increases.\n\n&gt; Some of the most notable indices this month included those regarding inventories. The Current Inventories index which gauges the net percent of owners viewing current inventory levels as too low rose 2 points to a record high reading of 5. Given this, the index for Plans to Increase Inventories is tied with the reading from November of 2004 for a record high of 11. Indicating low inventory levels, the report is consistent with some other recent data like the regional Fed manufacturing surveys. Those low inventories are resulting in higher prices as that index's 12-point increase in September marked the biggest one month gain on record. While the Higher Prices index is not at any sort of an extreme, September's move indicates that a rising number of businesses are raising prices.\n\n&gt; Additionally, those higher prices and lower inventory numbers appear to be a result of demand that continues to rapidly improve. The indices for Actual Sales and Actual Earnings Changes remain negative for a sixth and tenth month in a row, respectively, meaning a net number of businesses continue to see lower rather than higher top and bottom-line numbers. But these indices are seeing big moves higher. For the index of Actual Earnings Changes, the 13-point climb in September was the largest on record and the 9-point increase for Actual Sales Changes followed a 13-point increase in August; both being some of the largest one-month moves on record. In order to meet the needs of this demand, a higher number of businesses plan to increase employment with that index rising to 28; the highest level since December of 2018. Even though businesses seek to hire more, they also report it is hard to fill positions as the index of Job Openings Hard to Fill rose to the top 5% of all readings. Cost and quality of labor also were reported as two of the most pressing problems for businesses.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Table2.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Businesses Cautiously Optimistic\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we highlighted the details of the September NFIB Small Business Optimism report. The report showed overall sentiment among small businesses has continued to improve as demand has bounced back (though it has not yet fully recovered as still more businesses report lower sales and earnings on a net basis) leading to low inventory levels, higher prices, and a need for more employment. While generally improved conditions have lifted optimism, that is not to say small businesses have given an all-clear. The Uncertainty Index from NFIB has risen each of the past three months with September's 2-point increase bringing it back to the same level as March of this year. In other words, it is perhaps best to say that small businesses are cautiously optimistic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Uncertainty.png))**\n\n&gt; From the pandemic to the Election, there are plenty of reasons for businesses to be uncertain. As for what they are reporting to be the biggest problems, labor remains at the top. 30% of businesses have reported that either cost (9%) or more predominately quality (21%) of labor are their biggest issues. While off the highs from the past few years, the current readings are still historically elevated.\n\n&gt; Behind labor, government related problems also are largely on the minds of business owners. Government red tape and taxes combine to account for 29% of businesses' biggest problems. While that is a large share, neither of those indices are at any sort of extreme.\n\n&gt; Poor sales, on the other hand, remains as the third major concern for businesses. 12% of businesses reported poor sales as the single most important issue in September, down from 15% in August and 7-percentage points lower than the April peak. While improved, the number of businesses seeing demand as a major issue is still at some of the highest levels of the past several years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Most-Import-Problems.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment By State\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the year-to-date reading for the high-frequency Morning Consult daily consumer sentiment indicator. While still well off highs seen prior to the COVID Crash in late February and early March, sentiment has generally been ticking higher off the lows. You'll notice in the chart below, however, that while the \"Future Expectations\" reading is still bouncing back nicely, the \"Current Conditions\" reading has been going more sideways over the last couple of months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101420-MC.png))**\n\n&gt; We can also look closer into state level readings from the daily Morning Consult sentiment numbers. In the heat map below, we show the changes in the levels of consumer sentiment for each state since mid-February. As shown, the lower 48 have seen much larger improvements than Alaska or Hawaii with the largest improvements coming in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. On the other hand, in addition to Hawaii and Alaska, some of the key swing states like Maine, New Hampshire, and Nevada have improved the least. Of all 50 states, Vermont's current reading on sentiment is the closest to its February levels, but even Vermont is still down 17.9 points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101420-MC-By-State.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ffP3FJL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/nGdIfrv.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.19.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9fUPN3h.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xQoRNmb.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sWeYEHF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne3gwPi.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.21.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bNGBGWs.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uPFnifS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lk20RGG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I007KF1.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I0WSfDw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.23.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Tesla, Inc. $439.67\n**Tesla, Inc.

Option traders are pricing in a 12.9% move on earnings and the stock has averaged a 14.7% move in recent quarters.\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SNAP&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 881582, "public", "self", "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 19th, 2020", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jcun22/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "all_ads", 6, 1602935749.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bigbear0083", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_eaak0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1602939349, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jcun22/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jcun22", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "news", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "866eb162-65e6-11e5-a903-1252b640afe9", "link_flair_text": "News", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/jcun22/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "h5NkQIMU0jlBqFUWsNQjmcNlitkEWapjihkSsv4Y-1A", "resolutions": [{"height": 66, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/PuRA1Vifkv_Tnjlkx_8L_PLJfiZc_NJSRftj3jw0JVg.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f163af82edba3f6fe27fd4d0d1d24e3da532f37e", "width": 108}, {"height": 132, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/PuRA1Vifkv_Tnjlkx_8L_PLJfiZc_NJSRftj3jw0JVg.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5325f43dcec9e796fd09d611e5731181d0ec04c6", "width": 216}, {"height": 196, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/PuRA1Vifkv_Tnjlkx_8L_PLJfiZc_NJSRftj3jw0JVg.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81d409024180d0b34c642dd4ecb9bfb9f447552f", "width": 320}, {"height": 393, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/PuRA1Vifkv_Tnjlkx_8L_PLJfiZc_NJSRftj3jw0JVg.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e6aba4351d03c10943314530a5a0550fb5fc753", "width": 640}, {"height": 590, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/PuRA1Vifkv_Tnjlkx_8L_PLJfiZc_NJSRftj3jw0JVg.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f5c83925e6c8e414884a5e49574e33930af4f4e", "width": 960}, {"height": 664, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/PuRA1Vifkv_Tnjlkx_8L_PLJfiZc_NJSRftj3jw0JVg.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf910a69ff304be937695be9ce40f0497f86ebd3", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 759, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/PuRA1Vifkv_Tnjlkx_8L_PLJfiZc_NJSRftj3jw0JVg.png?auto=webp&amp;s=de2a235581522283964833f4e18e9134a4bbade9", "width": 1233}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1602939360, "score": 1, "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 19th, 2020.\n\n# **More volatility is likely ahead as rising cases, lack of stimulus overshadow strong earnings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/more-volatility-is-likely-ahead-as-rising-cases-lack-of-stimulus-overshadow-strong-earnings.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Another volatile week may be in store for traders as coronavirus cases rise in the U.S. and Europe while Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over new fiscal aid.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 fell for three straight days this week. That slide was the longest losing streak for the averages since mid-September. The two market benchmarks eked out slight gains on Friday to snap their losing streak.\n*****\n&gt; Investors and traders expect this choppy trading action to continue, especially as the worsening coronavirus data and a lack of U.S. coronavirus stimulus draw attention away from a strong earnings season thus far.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe combination of no stimulus, fading economic momentum, and the threat of rising coronavirus cases, creates a rather negative dynamic for risk assets right now,\u201d said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; The seven-day average of new daily coronavirus infections has risen in 39 states, including New York, New Jersey and Wisconsin, according to a CNBC analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University and the U.S. Census Bureau. At the nationwide level, the rate of new daily cases is at its highest level since August.\n*****\n&gt; In Europe, the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases has surpassed that of the U.S., leading several countries in the region to reinstate tougher social distancing rules and roll back previous reopening measures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat this means is economic activity may slow down a bit, and we\u2019ve already started to see some of that in the data,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, noting the weekly jobless claims numbers released Thursday show they\u2019ve reached a point where \u201cthey\u2019re not going to get better; they\u2019re going to get worse.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Labor Department said initial U.S. jobless claims hit their highest level since August, reaching 898,000 in the week ending Oct. 10.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also keep their eyes on Washington during the week ahead as lawmakers continue to struggle over new U.S. fiscal stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; # Political posturing on stimulus \u2018hurting\u2019 those in need\n&gt; This week, President Donald Trump said he would raise his offer for a coronavirus aid above the current level of $1.8 trillion. The White House\u2019s current offer is smaller than a $2.2 trillion package passed by the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said the administration\u2019s proposal \u201cfalls significantly short\u201d of what is needed.\n*****\n&gt; This back and forth between the two parties has dwindled expectations among market participants of a compromise being reached before the Nov. 3 election. It has also added to the concerns surrounding the U.S. economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis political posturing is hurting that cohort of the economy that needs help the most,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cTo the small and mid-size business owner, the airlines, this is not just about politics; this is every day life. There going to be an impact in the real economy if we don\u2019t see something now.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings season ignored?\n&gt; Those talks over further stimulus are also expected to divert attention away from the corporate earnings season, which began this week but had next to no impact on the broader market.\n*****\n&gt; Procter &amp; Gamble, Netflix, Travelers, American Airlines and American Express are among the companies slated to report next week.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and VF Corp. are among the 49 S&amp;P 500 companies that posted their latest quarterly results this week. Of those 49 companies, 86% reported better-than-expected earnings, according to data from The Earnings Scout.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI wish I could say that next week we\u2019re going to put aside the politics and the Covid concerns behind us, but we won\u2019t trade this earnings season,\u201d said Hogan of National Securities. \u201cWhile it will likely be a record-breaking season for companies beating estimates, it\u2019s also going to be one that is largely ignored because there\u2019re so many other macro factors that are more important.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There is also some important housing data in the week ahead, including home builders\u2019 sentiment Monday, housing starts Tuesday, and existing home sales Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe housing market is still off to the races,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe mortgage applications were strong, suggesting very strong activity in the month of September.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said the market will eventually cool when interest rates begin to rise. But for now, \u201ccertainly the economy could use the juice.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6i8E0Lr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zGJke6U.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/jkd6p4Z.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/sQiEyVc.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zksl2rH.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eBTMjg7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xUN9dhd.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Tu2aS7U.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ffP3FJL.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nGdIfrv.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/TrguDpO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4CSvumn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GN3ZIki.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts We Are Watching\n\n&gt; There are many charts that caught our attention this week, and today we share the top 5 charts we\u2019re watching.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index recently had a four-week losing streak and fell nearly 10% along the way, while the Nasdaq and many large cap tech stocks fell even more. Then in a big move higher over the past two weeks, many stocks moved from oversold to overbought in a very quick timeframe.\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, more than 90% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 were beneath their 10-day moving average on September 24 and within two weeks saw more than 90% above this short-term trend line. This type of buying thrust is consistent with future strong returns, suggests quick reversals from oversold to overbought are a good thing, and could bode well for stocks to outperform bonds well into 2021.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Parts of the economy are opening back up, while employment continues to disappoint. One specific area that continues to improve is how many people are flying, as the seven-day average number of travelers going through Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints hit a new recovery high. We discuss other high-frequency data points in our COVID Surge Stalling Europe\u2019s Recovery blog.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve noted before that stock market gains ahead of the election historically support the incumbent party, while if stocks are lower it tends to support new leadership in the White House. Taking this further, the US dollar also tends to send signals for who might win. In fact, when stocks are up and the US dollar is lower ahead of the election, or if stocks are lower and the US dollar is higher before an election, the results have accurately predicted the last seven times those scenarios took place. Given stocks are up and the US dollar is slightly lower, this could be one clue the upcoming election will be much closer than many are expecting.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Sticking with the election, many investors are worried about higher taxes and more deregulation if former Vice President Joe Biden wins. \u201cHigher taxes may be one part of it, but Biden is also looking at huge spending initiatives,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cStock markets like spending, and this could more than help offset potentially higher taxes.\u201d Lower tariffs could potentially provide another offset as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, Friday\u2019s retail sales report came in better than expected, marking five consecutive months of year-over-year gains. It is worth noting the economy has never been in a recession after 4 or more consecutive monthly gains. Still, in the face of one of the most severe recessions ever, it took only a few months for sales to get back to new highs, as shown below. Historically, new highs in retail sales happen in expansions\u2014and this is yet another clue the recession is likely over.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Record Surge In Business Formations As Economy Recovers From COVID\n\n&gt; Yesterday the Census updated business formation stats for Q3, and as indicated by high-frequency data from the Atlanta Fed, business formation exploded in Q3. As shown in the first chart below, total business applications rocketed upwards by 1.57 million, a record increase. Stripping out businesses that are unlikely to result in hiring, the numbers are much smaller in absolute terms but still rose 79% to a record pace. Finally, applications for businesses with planned wages surged 70% from a record low in Q2, to the highest levels since 2008.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101520-Biz-Apps.png))**\n\n&gt; In all three instances, the recent behavior is a complete reversal of the post-Financial Crisis period, when the prolonged recession led to a huge decline in business starts. That\u2019s a good sign for the breadth of the economic rebound, as business formation tends to lead to higher productivity thanks to more innovation and investment. Below we show changes in total business applications by state; Michigan, Illinois, and Georgia are the biggest winners, with applications more than doubling. This analysis was originally published in our evening report -- The Closer -- on 10/14/20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101520-Biz-Apps-State.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Rebound\n\n&gt; After a disappointment last month, Retail Sales saw a nice rebound in September as consumers seem undeterred from spending despite the expiration of extended UI benefits and the lack of an additional stimulus bill. For the month of September, headline Retail Sales rose 1.9% m/m versus expectations for a more modest increase of 0.8%. Ex Autos and Gas, growth was even better relative to expectations, although August\u2019s already slower than expected growth was revised modestly lower.\n\n&gt; Breadth in this month\u2019s report was strong. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but one of them (Electronics and Appliances) showed growth. Normally, when a sector shows m/m growth of a percent or two, it\u2019s impressive. This month, though, the volatility of the pandemic remains in place as two sectors showed growth of over 5%, including Clothing which saw double-digit growth relative to August!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/sectors1016.png))**\n\n&gt; While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # University of Michigan Mixed Again\n\n&gt; The University of Michigan reported preliminary consumer sentiment numbers for October. University of Michigan data has shown a much smaller bounce than other sentiment surveys, but the preliminary numbers for October did increase versus September. The strongest part of the survey was expectations, which has risen three months in a row to the highest levels since March. Consumers' current assessment of the economy fell sequentially and is sitting at about the same place it was back in early 2012.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101620-Michigan.png))**\n\n&gt; One feature of the University of Michigan poll with incomplete data prior to 2016 but more complete data since is a breakout of economic sentiment by political party affiliation. As shown below, their data shows Republicans getting a massive sentiment boost in the wake of the 2016 election. The key here though, is that the boost to the sentiment of Republicans and the decline for Democrats came after the election as this data is definitely lagging to political outcomes rather than leading.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101620-Michigan-Part.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Smiles\n\n&gt; Sentiment among small businesses continued to improve in the month of September according to the NFIB's monthly Small Business Optimism Index. As shown below, the index rose 3.8 points to 104 which is now just half of a point below the levels prior to the pandemic in February. That was also better than expectations of a smaller improvement to 101.2. Small business sentiment has now risen in four of the past five months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; In the table below, we break down this month's report by each of the ten components of the headline number as well as the many other indices included in the report such as those not used as inputs to the headline number and what small businesses are reporting to be their biggest problems.\n\n&gt; Across all indices of the September report, breadth was solid with only a couple of indices falling month over month\u2014Expected Credit Conditions and Credit Conditions Availability. Some of those that were higher saw record or near-record month-over-month increases.\n\n&gt; Some of the most notable indices this month included those regarding inventories. The Current Inventories index which gauges the net percent of owners viewing current inventory levels as too low rose 2 points to a record high reading of 5. Given this, the index for Plans to Increase Inventories is tied with the reading from November of 2004 for a record high of 11. Indicating low inventory levels, the report is consistent with some other recent data like the regional Fed manufacturing surveys. Those low inventories are resulting in higher prices as that index's 12-point increase in September marked the biggest one month gain on record. While the Higher Prices index is not at any sort of an extreme, September's move indicates that a rising number of businesses are raising prices.\n\n&gt; Additionally, those higher prices and lower inventory numbers appear to be a result of demand that continues to rapidly improve. The indices for Actual Sales and Actual Earnings Changes remain negative for a sixth and tenth month in a row, respectively, meaning a net number of businesses continue to see lower rather than higher top and bottom-line numbers. But these indices are seeing big moves higher. For the index of Actual Earnings Changes, the 13-point climb in September was the largest on record and the 9-point increase for Actual Sales Changes followed a 13-point increase in August; both being some of the largest one-month moves on record. In order to meet the needs of this demand, a higher number of businesses plan to increase employment with that index rising to 28; the highest level since December of 2018. Even though businesses seek to hire more, they also report it is hard to fill positions as the index of Job Openings Hard to Fill rose to the top 5% of all readings. Cost and quality of labor also were reported as two of the most pressing problems for businesses.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Table2.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Businesses Cautiously Optimistic\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we highlighted the details of the September NFIB Small Business Optimism report. The report showed overall sentiment among small businesses has continued to improve as demand has bounced back (though it has not yet fully recovered as still more businesses report lower sales and earnings on a net basis) leading to low inventory levels, higher prices, and a need for more employment. While generally improved conditions have lifted optimism, that is not to say small businesses have given an all-clear. The Uncertainty Index from NFIB has risen each of the past three months with September's 2-point increase bringing it back to the same level as March of this year. In other words, it is perhaps best to say that small businesses are cautiously optimistic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Uncertainty.png))**\n\n&gt; From the pandemic to the Election, there are plenty of reasons for businesses to be uncertain. As for what they are reporting to be the biggest problems, labor remains at the top. 30% of businesses have reported that either cost (9%) or more predominately quality (21%) of labor are their biggest issues. While off the highs from the past few years, the current readings are still historically elevated.\n\n&gt; Behind labor, government related problems also are largely on the minds of business owners. Government red tape and taxes combine to account for 29% of businesses' biggest problems. While that is a large share, neither of those indices are at any sort of extreme.\n\n&gt; Poor sales, on the other hand, remains as the third major concern for businesses. 12% of businesses reported poor sales as the single most important issue in September, down from 15% in August and 7-percentage points lower than the April peak. While improved, the number of businesses seeing demand as a major issue is still at some of the highest levels of the past several years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Most-Import-Problems.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment By State\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the year-to-date reading for the high-frequency Morning Consult daily consumer sentiment indicator. While still well off highs seen prior to the COVID Crash in late February and early March, sentiment has generally been ticking higher off the lows. You'll notice in the chart below, however, that while the \"Future Expectations\" reading is still bouncing back nicely, the \"Current Conditions\" reading has been going more sideways over the last couple of months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101420-MC.png))**\n\n&gt; We can also look closer into state level readings from the daily Morning Consult sentiment numbers. In the heat map below, we show the changes in the levels of consumer sentiment for each state since mid-February. As shown, the lower 48 have seen much larger improvements than Alaska or Hawaii with the largest improvements coming in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest.

The S&amp;P (SPY) fell 0.63%, and the Dow Jones finished the day 0.53% down.\n\nToday, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin admitted that coming to a deal regarding stimulus and advancing the measure through Congress would be \u201cdifficult\u201d before the November election. The remarks come shortly after Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi met on the phone to negotiate further, a deal Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson called \u201cproductive\u201d. The two are set to discuss again tomorrow, but after multiple weeks of discussion and the November election coming ever-nearer, chances for additional stimulus look dim. \n\nThe impasse between US lawmakers over stimulus is alarming, given the frequent calls of Pres. Trump, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members, and economist for more virus-relief. Yesterday, Senate Leader Mitch McConnel said he would introduce a smaller, more targeted proposal to the Senate when the chamber reconvenes next Monday. He said \u201cWhen the full Senate returns on October 19th, our first order of business will be voting again on targeted relief for American workers, including new funding for the PPP.\u201d The estimated $500 billion deal is way below the $1.8 trillion package proposed by the White House earlier in the week, a sign that negotiations may be souring. However, Pelosi has made it clear she would not support smaller, targeted bills, calling them inadequate. Pres. Trump appears to agree with her, tweeting \u201cGo big or go home!!!\u201d for more stimulus. \n\nIn other news, two companies in the forefront of vaccine development for the coronavirus announced their respective trials were put on trial over safety concerns. Eli Lilly (LLY) said Tuesday afternoon that enrollment for its COVID-19 treatment would be temporarily halted, less than a day after Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) said clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate were paused due to an unexplained illness in a participant. Shares of Eli Lilly and Johnson &amp; Johnson were little changed overnight after dropping during Tuesday\u2019s session.\n\nIn terms of earnings season, all eyes are on big banks as they have already started to report. An article published by Marketbeat summarized sentiment by stating that \u201cJPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America saw their profits partly recover in the third quarter from the depths of the coronavirus-caused recession earlier this year. The turnaround stems mostly from improvements in the U.S. economy that allowed these big banks to set aside less money to cover potentially bad loans \u2014 $5 billion in the third quarter versus $33 billion in the second quarter.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) reported third-quarter results that greatly exceeded expectations.

The S&amp;P (SPY) fell 0.63%, and the Dow Jones finished the day 0.53% down.\n\nToday, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin admitted that coming to a deal regarding stimulus and advancing the measure through Congress would be \u201cdifficult\u201d before the November election. The remarks come shortly after Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi met on the phone to negotiate further, a deal Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson called \u201cproductive\u201d. The two are set to discuss again tomorrow, but after multiple weeks of discussion and the November election coming ever-nearer, chances for additional stimulus look dim. \n\nThe impasse between US lawmakers over stimulus is alarming, given the frequent calls of Pres. Trump, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members, and economist for more virus-relief. Yesterday, Senate Leader Mitch McConnel said he would introduce a smaller, more targeted proposal to the Senate when the chamber reconvenes next Monday. He said \u201cWhen the full Senate returns on October 19th, our first order of business will be voting again on targeted relief for American workers, including new funding for the PPP.\u201d The estimated $500 billion deal is way below the $1.8 trillion package proposed by the White House earlier in the week, a sign that negotiations may be souring. However, Pelosi has made it clear she would not support smaller, targeted bills, calling them inadequate. Pres. Trump appears to agree with her, tweeting \u201cGo big or go home!!!\u201d for more stimulus. \n\nIn other news, two companies in the forefront of vaccine development for the coronavirus announced their respective trials were put on trial over safety concerns. Eli Lilly (LLY) said Tuesday afternoon that enrollment for its COVID-19 treatment would be temporarily halted, less than a day after Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) said clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate were paused due to an unexplained illness in a participant. Shares of Eli Lilly and Johnson &amp; Johnson were little changed overnight after dropping during Tuesday\u2019s session.\n\nIn terms of earnings season, all eyes are on big banks as they have already started to report. An article published by Marketbeat summarized sentiment by stating that \u201cJPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America saw their profits partly recover in the third quarter from the depths of the coronavirus-caused recession earlier this year. The turnaround stems mostly from improvements in the U.S. economy that allowed these big banks to set aside less money to cover potentially bad loans \u2014 $5 billion in the third quarter versus $33 billion in the second quarter.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) reported third-quarter results that greatly exceeded expectations.

The small-cap benchmark is now approaching its year to date high of 1705.2, set in January, and is only 100-odd points below the record it reached in 2018.\n* Intel Corporation (INTC) had price target raised by UBS from $64 to $67\n* Livongo (LVGO) had its price target raised by JPMorgan (JPM) from $88 to $150\n* NIO was upgraded by JPMorgan Chase from NEUTRAL to OVERWEIGHT with $40 price target.

I\u2019ve known about stocks for while and did research and I\u2019ve been kinda obsessed with stocks. The last month, I researched everything so I\u2019m not a \u201cbeginner\u201d but I am at the same time.

I've decided to put together a little summary for the week that details some trending tickers, option activity, and some setups for next week ( + reasoning for the setup). Mods if this isn't allowed, I won't post again. Here we go:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Upcoming Earnings\n\nMicron (MU) Earnings are coming up this week. The semi-conductor company has been consistently beating earnings and has seen some growth throughout the pandemic as more companies become increasingly tech-focused with work-from-home orders. Here\u2019s a snapshot of their most recent earnings and performance moves day-after the report. \n\n[https://imgur.com/stDsUEx](https://imgur.com/stDsUEx)\n\n**What to look for**\n\nBy proxy, companies that will see some related movements to MU\u2019s earnings are: AMD, INTC, and NVDA. A good showing from MU will also mean good things for other semi-conductor companies.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at MU\u2019s average options\u2019 Implied Volatility (IV) over the last month. We can see that typical IV is in the 40-45% range. When the stock price dropped early September during the crash, we saw IV get up to the 60\u2019s. IV has begun to dip back into the 40\u2019s meaning there is not a huge move expected off the earnings report. (Stock price is gold vs IV blue line). \n\n[https://imgur.com/87nthwQ](https://imgur.com/87nthwQ)\n\n# Economic Calendar\n\nWe have some important economic data coming out this week. Here\u2019s the outlook:\n\nTuesday 10am: Consumer Confidence\n\nWednesday 8:30am: GDP Q2, Pending Home Sales\n\nThursday 8:30am: Jobless claims\n\nFriday 8:30am: Unemployment Rate\n\n**Full Calendar of Important Events w/ Forecasts (via Bloomberg):** \n\n[https://imgur.com/1XEHPyC](https://imgur.com/1XEHPyC)\n\n# Trending Stocks\n\nMost Mentioned Tickers + Sentiment from Friday \n\n[https://imgur.com/jTw7JiO](https://imgur.com/jTw7JiO)\n\n# This week\u2019s trend gainers and losers\n\n**Losing Hype:** TSLA, VALE, NKLA, MSFT, WMT, AAPL\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/0wdvTJB](https://imgur.com/0wdvTJB)\n\n**Gaining Hype:** BA, VXX, ZM, AAL, UPS, PTON, MU\n\n[https://imgur.com/hpakS2h](https://imgur.com/hpakS2h)\n\n\\*AAPL was losing hype on the weekly trend, but up on the daily trend Thursday &amp; Friday from a good performance.  \n\n# Consolidating Tickers\n\nThese tickers are ones that have once been a \u201cmeme\u201d, but have since settled down, and perhaps a good entry point if your technicals are right, it aligns with your strategy, and want to avoid FOMO-ing into hot stocks. \n\n[https://imgur.com/5YsYE1a](https://imgur.com/5YsYE1a)\n\n# The classic tale of doing the inverse of WSB\n\nToday we\u2019ll take a look at VALE, a stock that was almost never mentioned a single time in the last month on r/WallStreetBets until September 18th. At that point, the stock had risen 10% in the week before and VALE was then seen all over the comment section of the sub. Comment volume for VALE jumped to 10% of total comment volume on the sub-reddit at which point many WSB members initiated positions. Within the next several trading days the stock tanked 15% leaving WSB holding the bag (yet again). For more details on this, please read \u201cHow not to FOMO into trades\u201d. \n\n[https://imgur.com/oZ7xY0B](https://imgur.com/oZ7xY0B)\n\n**Swaggy DD (due diligence) released this week - GME (Gamestop)** \n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n\nWhen I look at the sentiment surrounding GameStop, it doesn\u2019t take very long to see comments like these, yet here we are. What\u2019s going on? Are people that stupid? Just jumping on the new console cycle? Idiots not pulling their gains and going to zero? When even r/wallstreetbets thinks the stock is a dud, it must be right? Nearly 120% short interest, yet the stock is up nearly 40% this week.\n\nIts no secret GameStop has been hurting. The secular shift to digital has been pressuring them for some time with their highest margin category - used video software \u2013 under significant distress. Each year their gross margins contract with net income in the red these past few quarters. Everybody has written them off as the easiest short in the world, however I'm going to try to explain whats going on and tell you that buying GameStop may not be as bad as you think.\n\n**II. CONSOLES**\n\nJust to start things off, you have to remember we\u2019re in the beginnings of the new console cycle. But what does that even mean? Well the advent of new consoles means new trade-ins, new product, new customers, and a fresh spike in GameStop\u2019s popularity. Sales have stagnated the years prior, and they are all but certain to go up and remain elevated for the next 1-2 years. Note that against all counts, the company was actually profitable during the 2019 holiday season, with new consoles you can bet that they will annihilate all expectations and proceed into 4-8 more positive quarters off the cyclic shift. This is pretty unanimous, and everyone accepts that they will start reporting positive going forward. In fact, new console cycles are where GME has historically spiked.\n\n[Click here to continue reading the DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ivs6dw/bankrupting_institutional_investors_for_dummies/)\n\n# Swaggy Play &amp; Trade Idea - JPM\n\nWhat's up everyone, market has been choppy as FK and almost un-tradeable the last several weeks. Still, not much has changed fundamentally over the last 3-4 weeks and here we are with a 10-20% haircut on stocks depending which tickers you follow. I've been sitting on my hands for a while, but entered a trade today. Keep in mind this is not advice on what or how to trade, simply posting my trade here and if you want to discuss some opinions, lets do it.\n\nWhy JPM? It has been in a fairly tight channel over the last 3-4 months, staying in the range of $90-100. I entered this exact play back in July when the stock dropped to similar levels to where it is currently at right now, and closed at max profit back then. \n\n[Check out the full play details (reasoning + risks)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/izmt2r/swaggyplay_trade_idea_jpm/)\n\n# Unusual Option Activity\n\nSome big volume in option flow was spotted this week in some names: AAPL, ADBE, C, CLDR, ORCL, PBR, and WRTC.\n\n**ADBE \u2013 Adobe**\n\nADBE saw a massive call block come through on Friday. 5,000 January 2021 CALLs at the $420 strike (10% ITM). Total position size was $40 million. ADBE was about 10-15% off the recent highs and has bounced multiple times off the $470 level. IF this sell-off is truly over, we might see a good bounce in tech and some of these block purchases seem to be positioning for it. \n\n[Read Full Post: Weekly Option Flow Summary, Week of Sept 20-2020: AAPL, ADBE, C, CLDR, ORCL, PBR, WRTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/j0rev4/unusual_option_flow_summary_for_the_week_aapl/)\n\n**What\u2019s on the watchlist this week**\n\nStill looking for a bounce in tech. Here are some stocks I either like and have a position or I\u2019m looking for entry points on (stock price + Implied Volatility charts)\n\n**AAPL - Apple**  \n\nAAPL is currently near a short-term low. Does it have room to go down more? Sure, but I think when you dig below the current levels you will be finding more buyers as we get closer to $100. IMO a good entry point for a long-term hold. IV is also moderately high for options. They are set to report earnings by end of October and also have catalyst of rumored 5g iPhone release.\n\n**AMD - Advanced Micro Devices**  \n\nAMD has shown some strength at the $78 level of support through these last few weeks of downside pressure. AMD also reports towards the end of October, but will have some volatility into MU (Micron Technology) earnings next week. IV is pretty high right now for AMD to buy calls. A more efficient play might be to sell CSP (cash-secured put), credit PUT spreads, or purchase shares.\n\n**DOCU - Docusign**  \n\nA second-wave covid-play I\u2019m looking at is DOCU. DOCU just reported earnings that weren\u2019t accepted well by Wall Street. The stock has dropped nearly 30% since it\u2019s peak of $290 not long ago. You can also see the IV has dropped significantly after earnings. Average IV was as high as 140% pre-earnings and is now sitting around 55%. IMO this is a fundamentally strong company with solid branding. If you\u2019ve ever needed to sign important documents online, chances are you\u2019ve used Docusign before and it is quickly becoming a household name.

Mods if this isn't allowed, I won't post again. Here we go:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Upcoming Earnings\n\nMicron (MU) Earnings are coming up this week. The semi-conductor company has been consistently beating earnings and has seen some growth throughout the pandemic as more companies become increasingly tech-focused with work-from-home orders. Here\u2019s a snapshot of their most recent earnings and performance moves day-after the report. \n\n[https://imgur.com/stDsUEx](https://imgur.com/stDsUEx)\n\n**What to look for**\n\nBy proxy, companies that will see some related movements to MU\u2019s earnings are: AMD, INTC, and NVDA. A good showing from MU will also mean good things for other semi-conductor companies.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at MU\u2019s average options\u2019 Implied Volatility (IV) over the last month. We can see that typical IV is in the 40-45% range. When the stock price dropped early September during the crash, we saw IV get up to the 60\u2019s. IV has begun to dip back into the 40\u2019s meaning there is not a huge move expected off the earnings report. (Stock price is gold vs IV blue line). \n\n[https://imgur.com/87nthwQ](https://imgur.com/87nthwQ)\n\n# Economic Calendar\n\nWe have some important economic data coming out this week. Here\u2019s the outlook:\n\nTuesday 10am: Consumer Confidence\n\nWednesday 8:30am: GDP Q2, Pending Home Sales\n\nThursday 8:30am: Jobless claims\n\nFriday 8:30am: Unemployment Rate\n\n**Full Calendar of Important Events w/ Forecasts (via Bloomberg):** \n\n[https://imgur.com/1XEHPyC](https://imgur.com/1XEHPyC)\n\n# Trending Stocks\n\nMost Mentioned Tickers + Sentiment from Friday \n\n[https://imgur.com/jTw7JiO](https://imgur.com/jTw7JiO)\n\n# This week\u2019s trend gainers and losers\n\n**Losing Hype:** TSLA, VALE, NKLA, MSFT, WMT, AAPL\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/0wdvTJB](https://imgur.com/0wdvTJB)\n\n**Gaining Hype:** BA, VXX, ZM, AAL, UPS, PTON, MU\n\n[https://imgur.com/hpakS2h](https://imgur.com/hpakS2h)\n\n\\*AAPL was losing hype on the weekly trend, but up on the daily trend Thursday &amp; Friday from a good performance.  \n\n# Consolidating Tickers\n\nThese tickers are ones that have once been a \u201cmeme\u201d, but have since settled down, and perhaps a good entry point if your technicals are right, it aligns with your strategy, and want to avoid FOMO-ing into hot stocks. \n\n[https://imgur.com/5YsYE1a](https://imgur.com/5YsYE1a)\n\n# The classic tale of doing the inverse of WSB\n\nToday we\u2019ll take a look at VALE, a stock that was almost never mentioned a single time in the last month on r/WallStreetBets until September 18th. At that point, the stock had risen 10% in the week before and VALE was then seen all over the comment section of the sub. Comment volume for VALE jumped to 10% of total comment volume on the sub-reddit at which point many WSB members initiated positions. Within the next several trading days the stock tanked 15% leaving WSB holding the bag (yet again). For more details on this, please read \u201cHow not to FOMO into trades\u201d. \n\n[https://imgur.com/oZ7xY0B](https://imgur.com/oZ7xY0B)\n\n**Swaggy DD (due diligence) released this week - GME (Gamestop)** \n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n\nWhen I look at the sentiment surrounding GameStop, it doesn\u2019t take very long to see comments like these, yet here we are. What\u2019s going on? Are people that stupid? Just jumping on the new console cycle? Idiots not pulling their gains and going to zero? When even r/wallstreetbets thinks the stock is a dud, it must be right? Nearly 120% short interest, yet the stock is up nearly 40% this week.\n\nIts no secret GameStop has been hurting. The secular shift to digital has been pressuring them for some time with their highest margin category - used video software \u2013 under significant distress. Each year their gross margins contract with net income in the red these past few quarters. Everybody has written them off as the easiest short in the world, however I'm going to try to explain whats going on and tell you that buying GameStop may not be as bad as you think.\n\n**II. CONSOLES**\n\nJust to start things off, you have to remember we\u2019re in the beginnings of the new console cycle. But what does that even mean? Well the advent of new consoles means new trade-ins, new product, new customers, and a fresh spike in GameStop\u2019s popularity. Sales have stagnated the years prior, and they are all but certain to go up and remain elevated for the next 1-2 years. Note that against all counts, the company was actually profitable during the 2019 holiday season, with new consoles you can bet that they will annihilate all expectations and proceed into 4-8 more positive quarters off the cyclic shift. This is pretty unanimous, and everyone accepts that they will start reporting positive going forward. In fact, new console cycles are where GME has historically spiked.\n\n[Click here to continue reading the DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ivs6dw/bankrupting_institutional_investors_for_dummies/)\n\n# Swaggy Play &amp; Trade Idea - JPM\n\nWhat's up everyone, market has been choppy as FK and almost un-tradeable the last several weeks. Still, not much has changed fundamentally over the last 3-4 weeks and here we are with a 10-20% haircut on stocks depending which tickers you follow. I've been sitting on my hands for a while, but entered a trade today. Keep in mind this is not advice on what or how to trade, simply posting my trade here and if you want to discuss some opinions, lets do it.\n\nWhy JPM? It has been in a fairly tight channel over the last 3-4 months, staying in the range of $90-100. I entered this exact play back in July when the stock dropped to similar levels to where it is currently at right now, and closed at max profit back then. \n\n[Check out the full play details (reasoning + risks)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/izmt2r/swaggyplay_trade_idea_jpm/)\n\n# Unusual Option Activity\n\nSome big volume in option flow was spotted this week in some names: AAPL, ADBE, C, CLDR, ORCL, PBR, and WRTC.\n\n**ADBE \u2013 Adobe**\n\nADBE saw a massive call block come through on Friday. 5,000 January 2021 CALLs at the $420 strike (10% ITM). Total position size was $40 million. ADBE was about 10-15% off the recent highs and has bounced multiple times off the $470 level. IF this sell-off is truly over, we might see a good bounce in tech and some of these block purchases seem to be positioning for it. \n\n[Read Full Post: Weekly Option Flow Summary, Week of Sept 20-2020: AAPL, ADBE, C, CLDR, ORCL, PBR, WRTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/j0rev4/unusual_option_flow_summary_for_the_week_aapl/)\n\n**What\u2019s on the watchlist this week**\n\nStill looking for a bounce in tech. Here are some stocks I either like and have a position or I\u2019m looking for entry points on (stock price + Implied Volatility charts)\n\n**AAPL - Apple**  \n\nAAPL is currently near a short-term low. Does it have room to go down more? Sure, but I think when you dig below the current levels you will be finding more buyers as we get closer to $100. IMO a good entry point for a long-term hold. IV is also moderately high for options. They are set to report earnings by end of October and also have catalyst of rumored 5g iPhone release.\n\n**AMD - Advanced Micro Devices**  \n\nAMD has shown some strength at the $78 level of support through these last few weeks of downside pressure. AMD also reports towards the end of October, but will have some volatility into MU (Micron Technology) earnings next week. IV is pretty high right now for AMD to buy calls. A more efficient play might be to sell CSP (cash-secured put), credit PUT spreads, or purchase shares.\n\n**DOCU - Docusign**  \n\nA second-wave covid-play I\u2019m looking at is DOCU.

semiconductor company. The  article cited Nvidia\u2019s favorable exposure to data center, gaming, and  AI as major reasons why the company overtook top spot from Intel. Only  two months later, Nvidia is now worth $107bn more than Intel. In other  words, Nvidia is worth more than an AMD more than its Santa Clara rival.  Around the same time, AMD (AMD)  also began to see significant out-performance relative to Intel shares.  With continued momentum in the PC market on the back of its Ryzen  processors and increased success in data center with the EPYC product  line, AMD has risen 57% since the start of July. Over that period, Intel  declined 15%. \n\nIn contrast to Nvidia and AMD, Intel is disproportionately associated with  the PC. Yet even within the PC market, analyst commentary has been  overwhelmingly positive on AMD whereas doubts have surfaced over Intel\u2019s  ability to innovate and remain competitive. In the span of a week at  the end of July, Intel announced a major delay with its 7nm chips and  AMD beat Q2 earnings, raised guidance, and hit its highest PC market  share since 2013. However, the focus on Intel as a struggling PC player  has wrongly overlooked several important developments that set the company up for a near-term rebound in PC and [long-term revenue opportunities in the same higher growth end markets that have fueled premium valuations for both Nvidia and AMD](https://blackjacketco.com/f/new-brand-new-intel-growth-ahead-for-tiger-lake-edge-and-av).\u00a0\n\n1. Release of Tiger Lake processor, expanded efforts in graphics via  Xe architecture, and development of discrete GPUs for data center and  desktop\n2. Continued momentum in company shift to data-centric business first and PC business second\n3. Expanded Total Addressable Market (TAM) associated with edge computing and edge-enabled technologies\n4. Competitive positioning in autonomous vehicle technology\n\nIntel is currently priced for stagnant to declining revenues, further market share erosion, and lower  relative probability of success compared to Nvidia and AMD. Given recent  product releases and refreshes, as well as a strong strategic vision to  increase share in these higher growth end markets, Intel revenue is  more likely to accelerate and lead to significant multiple expansion in  the coming years.\u00a0\n\n* Assigning Intel CY23 PT of $125 per share\n* FY23 revenue projected at $100bn\n* FY23 net income projected at $34bn delivering 7.55 in EPS\n* Applying 16.55x P/E and 4.55 P/S\u00a0\n\nFor an in-depth and comprehensive breakdown on Intel's competitive positioning, see below:\n\n**Tiger Lake and Renewed PC Innovation**\u00a0\n\nYesterday  Intel finally revealed the highly anticipated Tiger Lake 11th  generation processors for ultra-thin high-performance laptops. Industry  reporting in previous months had speculated that the new system-on-chip  (SoC \u2013 incorporates different components like graphics and AI into one  integrated unit) would offer CPU performance advances and improvements  in graphics and AI. Intel even leaked some specs on Monday that seemed  to confirm some of the performance metrics. Although independent  industry studies are required to run Tiger Lake through its full paces,  the event demonstrated that not only can Intel still innovate, it is  more than premature to start counting the company out on PCs.\u00a0\n\nTiger  Lake clocks up to 20% higher frequencies compared to the 10th  generation Ice Lake family and can reach a single core turbo of 4.8 GHz.  During the presentation, Intel noted that the integrated Iris Xe  graphics perform better than 90% of PCs sold last year, on-board AI is  up to 5x more effective, and WiFi connectivity is up to 3x faster. In a  like-for-like comparison to AMD, Tiger Lake enabled 4x faster photo  upscaling, 2x faster video processing and exporting via Adobe Pro, and  20% faster performance in both Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. For  gaming, Intel conducted side-by-side tests using Gears Tactics. Laptops  running AMD 4800U with integrated graphics and a Nvidia MX350 discrete  graphics card (with Intel 10th Gen i7) performed worse than Tiger Lake.  Intel\u2019s test showed that Tiger Lake handled the game at up to 66% higher  frames per second versus the AMD and Nvidia-powered laptops.\u00a0\n\nBarring significant discrepancies found during independent reviews, Intel just  delivered performance on 10nm that is equivalent to what is possible on  7nm. With the simultaneous launch of the Evo brand to encompass the new  11th generation-powered ultra-thin high-performance laptop range, Intel  can begin building customer brand recognition and altering perceptions  that Intel has lost competitive footing in the PC market. With 50 PC  designs set to ship with Tiger Lake as soon as this fall, and at least  150 designs anticipated from partner OEMs, Intel may see a very  near-term recovery in its PC market share even despite the 7nm delay.\u00a0 \n\n**Transition to Data-Centric Business and Future at the Edge**\n\nMore  important to Intel\u2019s future is the multi-year shift towards  higher-growth end markets associated with cloud, edge, and data. Rather  than PCs, Intel sees its primary business as the Data-Centric reporting  segment that now comprises 52% of revenues. That figure is likely to  expand in coming quarters following 34% YoY growth in the most recent  earnings report. In FY19 Q2, the Data-Centric segment only accounted for  46% of revenues.\u00a0\n\nThat  Data-Centric segment includes: The Data Center Group (36.3% of total  Intel revenues); Non-Volatile Memory Storage Group (8.5%);  Internet-of-Things Group (3.4%); Programmable Solutions Group (2.6%);  and Mobileye (0.7%). The two largest contributors to the segment are  performing extremely well. The Data Center Group grew 43% YoY and saw  operating income climb 72%. The second largest business in the segment,  Non-Volatile Memory Storage, grew 76% YoY for record revenue on the back  of NAND demand growth and higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs).\u00a0\n\nBy  2024, Intel expects its TAM to reach $300bn. But $230bn of this is  attributed to the Data-Centric TAM. And Intel\u2019s own calculations may be  slightly conservative. In the company\u2019s analysis of its various end  markets, Intel only mentioned the edge compute market in general terms.  Yet that market alone is projected to surpass $100bn by 2030. As much as  public cloud adoption drove demand for server-related products over the  past five years, the edge could end up being a far more important  trend. That is because, in addition to further server demand, the edge  will enable billions of IoT devices to finally become widespread after  years of hype. With TAM growth associated with edge server CPU, GPU, and  storage, plus IoT and edge AI solutions, Intel can achieve growth into  the 2030s so long as the company can execute on its strategic vision. \u00a0\n\n*Edge Server*\u00a0\n\nAn S&amp;P Global study  in spring 2020 estimated that Intel has 90-95% share of the data center  CPU market despite recent share gains by AMD. While edge server  architectures and processes differ versus hyperscale cloud servers, this  figure is testament to the strength of Intel\u2019s relationships with the  leading cloud providers that are also among the early movers in the edge  computing space \u2013 namely Amazon with its Lambda@Edge platform,  Microsoft with Azure Functions, and Google with Google Cloud Functions. \u00a0\n\nFor  smaller edge providers especially, like Fastly, Akamai, or Cloudflare,  there will be particular emphasis on price-per-performance for server  components. Until recently, that dynamic favored AMD whose EPYC Rome  7742 processor rivals Intel\u2019s Xeon Platinum 8280 on performance yet  undercuts it on price by about 60%. The cost efficiency of EPYC led to  some important edge server design wins for AMD, including Cloudflare\u2019s  new GenX server that excluded Intel parts for the first time.\u00a0\n\nThe  latest Xeon processors had been on the market for a couple years,  though, and Intel refreshed the product line earlier this year in an  attempt to greatly reduce cost while maintaining performance. In its 24  February press release, Intel directly addressed the need to become more  competitive with AMD on price-per-performance noting that the Xeon  refresh: \u201c\u2026\\[reinforces\\] Intel\u2019s data center leadership by providing  greater performance and performance-per-dollar choices for\u2026customers  across cloud, network and edge.\u201d While Intel compromised on  compatibility with certain server designs, the result is 1.42x better  price-per-core-performance and a cost of $141 per-core for the Gold  6258R. The price tag puts Xeon in a much stronger position relative to  EPYC Rome 7742 which goes for $108 per-core.\u00a0\n\nDespite  early advantages in cost-per-performance for AMD, Intel still managed  to double its edge deployments year-over-year according to Forbes. And  its impressive partner list includes Lenovo, Red Hat, Advantech,  Caswell, Inventec, Lanner, Nexcom, World Wide Technology, Ericsson, ZTE,  Verizon, Vodafone, Nokia, and China Telecom, among others. With drastic  improvements in price-per-performance, Intel could very well see  additional customer wins in upcoming quarters.\u00a0\n\nBeyond  CPU, edge applications will see an increase in demand for integrated  and hybrid GPUs. Between advancements in Intel Xe graphics and its  development of discrete graphics cards, the company will become better  positioned to take advantage of the more than 33% CAGR projected for  GPUs from 2020 to 2027 \u2013 taking the market from just under $20bn in 2019  to over $200bn according to Deloitte.  Even if Nvidia and AMD maintain large leads over Intel in GPU market  share for edge servers, even a marginal portion of the market could be  meaningful to the Data Center Group which measured around $7bn in Q2.\u00a0\n\nIn  addition, edge servers present an unprecedented opportunity for NAND  solutions as well \u2013 specifically flash storage that utilizes the NVMe  (Non-Volatile Memory Express) protocol. Edge servers have strong need  for high-performance startup operations and extremely reliable storage.  That is because rapid startup times are critical for edge providers to  quickly launch computing instances and deliver the lowest possible  latency for their customers. Improvements in NVMe NAND greatly shrink  the physical storage footprint, reduce power and cooling costs, all the  while improving the overall speed, flexibility, and failure rates. And  Intel Optane and 3D NAND SSDs are exceptionally reliable for storage and  offer performance improvements over legacy storage solutions.\u00a0\n\n*IoT and AI*\n\nMuch  like edge servers, edge deployed IoT devices will similarly boost  demand for Intel processors. For workload intensive industrial IoT,  Intel has its Core processor. And the Intel Atom processor is  purpose-built for lower-power or embedded applications. Because IoT  devices will collect and process vast amounts of data, these  applications will also require significant amounts of flash memory \u2013  specifically NAND. On-device NAND SSD can increase data transfer speeds  while also integrating module-level security features, remote  management, and more flexible power configurations. Collectively,  improvements in NAND will lower total cost of ownership for these  machines. \u00a0\n\nThe edge will lead  to rapid growth for edge AI chipsets that enable IoT devices to deploy  machine learning at the edge without having to send data via internet  back to a centralized data center. Deloitte notes that around 300  million edge AI chips were sold in 2017, but this year could see more  than 750 million units hit the market. With compounded annual growth in  edge AI chipsets anticipated to outpace the broader semiconductor  industry by a considerable amount, ABI research predicts that these edge chips will surpass the market for cloud AI chips by 2025 \u2013 marking a massive shift.\u00a0\n\n**Mobileye and Autonomous Driving Technology**\u00a0\n\nIt  is interesting the extent to which mainstream conversations in media  and financial commentary largely exclude Intel\u2019s Mobileye and instead  focus on Tesla as the technology leader in autonomous vehicles and  Nvidia as the chipmaker best positioned to disrupt. Although Telsa  claims to offer autonomous modes for its vehicles, based on the 5-level  autonomous capability hierarchy \u2013 the industry standard established by  the Society of Automotive Engineers \u2013 the most advanced cars currently  on the market only operate at level 2+. Level 2+ falls between levels 2  (partial automation) and 3 (conditional automation). The hardware to  support full level 5 autonomy does exist in 2020, and the software  necessary to manage these systems is not too far behind. However, it  will likely take 5-7 years before manufacturing volumes reach levels to  drive down hardware prices, the necessary regulatory frameworks come  into place, and fully autonomous vehicles gain broad consumer  acceptance. \u00a0\n\nIn the  intermediary period, the progression towards level 5 autonomy will  continue to be gradual and incremental. Higher degrees of autonomy will  be achieved by increasingly sophisticated advanced driver assistance  systems (ADAS) that prove out the viability of these technologies and  underpin the manufacturing, regulatory, and consumer environment that  will facilitate the future arrival of self-driving cars. Beyond this, in  many cases the same technology at the center of levels 4 and 5 builds  on the existing foundations of ADAS capabilities. And the dominant  player in the ADAS market is not Tesla, Waymo, or Nvidia. It is  Mobileye.\u00a0\n\nMobileye\u2019s market  share has consistently stayed above 70% for years, even as competition  from other players has ramped up \u2013 Nvidia in particular. The Mobileye  solution is noteworthy, pairing its SoC \u2013 the EyeQ family \u2013 to support a  range of ADAS capabilities using only a single camera sensor. This  differs from the LiDAR and radar-based systems favored by Waymo, Uber,  GM-owned Cruise, and Nvidia. Tesla \u2013 who previously used Mobileye  technology until the two parted ways in 2016 \u2013 also leverages a  camera-based system. However, Tesla deploys ultrasonic sensors and  radars in combination with billions of miles of driver data.\u00a0\n\nMobileye\u2019s  commanding market share in ADAS means that its technology is used by  more than 300 models from 25 global automakers, resulting in 60 million  vehicles on the road worldwide. In contrast, Tesla currently has fewer  than 1 million vehicles on the road equipped with variants of its  autopilot technology. And Mobileye is already working with 4 major OEMs  to soon provide level 3 autonomous solutions. As part of its  arrangements with OEMs, Mobileye receives access to sensor data from  customer vehicles. At present, Mobileye is collecting 3.7 million miles  per day and growing as another 2 million vehicles from these OEMs are  set to join the data-sharing program over the next two years.\u00a0\n\nWhat  this translates to is a massive partner network with the world\u2019s  leading auto OEMs who will all have a vested interest in competing with  Tesla both in autonomous but also electric vehicles. This also means  that Mobileye has a significant advantage over Nvidia in getting its  ADAS and future autonomous solutions on vehicles. As Mobileye further  prioritizes its fully autonomous solutions, its leading competitive  positioning in ADAS, as well its strong relationships with OEMs, gives  the company a strategic advantage over its competitors as higher levels  of autonomous technologies go to market. This is evidenced by Mobileye\u2019s  strategic partnership with Tesla EV rival NIO to offer level 4 consumer  vehicles by 2022.\u00a0\n\nEven though  Mobileye made its name based on its single camera platform, the company  is separately developing what is called a full autonomous stack,  incorporating the necessary LiDAR, radar, non-camera sensors, GPS,  modems, and other hardware components that will run on its 5thgeneration  EyeQ processor. In the meantime, Mobileye recently demoed a  self-driving vehicle that navigated the congested streets of Jerusalem  using only 12 cameras and no LiDAR, radar, or non-camera sensors.\u00a0\n\nOn  the back of the hyperbolic move in Tesla shares YTD, numerous articles  have lauded the company\u2019s so-called multi-year advantages over rivals in  the space. Notably, in July Elon Musk stated that Tesla is \u201cvery close\u201d  to level 5 autonomy with no updates needed to hardware as the company\u2019s  Tesla Computer processor currently supports full autonomy. Mobileye\u2019s  EyeQ 5 also supports level 5 autonomy, however. And although the Tesla  Computer exceeds EyeQ 5 on tera operations per second (TOPS), EyeQ 5  offers footprint and power consumption advantages. Moreover, unlike most  other players in autonomous systems, Mobileye has opted for an open  architecture that enables OEMs to program their own software on top of  Mobileye hardware.\u00a0\n\nTesla has a  lead in data collected per mile at over 3 billion miles, but Mobileye is  catching up and its data repositories also exceed the billion-mile mark  on an annual run rate basis. To deepen the data sets available to  Mobileye, Intel also bought Israeli mobility-as-a-service company Moovit  for $900mn this year. Like Tesla, Mobileye is set to offer its  technology in the important robotaxi market that many in the industry  view as the precursor to consumer-adopted fully autonomous vehicles down  the line. Mobileye is launching pilot robotaxi fleets in Tel Aviv,  Paris, and Daegu City in 2022.\u00a0\n\nMobileye  still accounts for less than 1% of total Intel revenues despite  doubling sales since being acquired by Intel. Given the strength of  Mobileye\u2019s position in the ADAS market that is expected to grow to more  than $80bn by 2030, as well as the prospects in robotaxis and level 4/5  autonomous systems, Mobileye has strong potential to develop into a  major growth engine for Intel over the next 4-5 years.\u00a0\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIntel  shares are roughly flat since early 2018 despite revenues up almost 20%  from FY19 Q2 to FY20 Q2. The relative out-performance in Nvidia and AMD  shares over that time has furthered perceptions that Intel could fall  behind as the former two companies achieve sustained revenue growth tied  to more attractive end markets like data center, gaming, AI, and  autonomous vehicles.\u00a0\n\nHowever,  recent struggles with certain products and lost PC market share to AMD  have distracted investors from Intel\u2019s ongoing transition to a more data-centric business. With a $230bn TAM projected by 2024 for this  operating segment alone, Intel has multiple opportunities to likewise  drive revenue growth over the long-term.\u00a0\n\nGiven  the company\u2019s recent advancements with its 11th generation Tiger Lake SoC, continued progress in improving price-per-performance for edge  server components, and the vastly underrated leadership of Mobileye in  the ADAS and autonomous vehicle markets, Intel offers an extremely  compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to these  technology trends at a more reasonable valuation.\u00a0\n\n*You can find me on Twitter* [@BlackjacketCo](https://twitter.com/BlackjacketCo) *where I write about emerging technologies, industry news, and long-term market trends.

The  article cited Nvidia\u2019s favorable exposure to data center, gaming, and  AI as major reasons why the company overtook top spot from Intel. Only  two months later, Nvidia is now worth $107bn more than Intel. In other  words, Nvidia is worth more than an AMD more than its Santa Clara rival.  Around the same time, AMD (AMD)  also began to see significant out-performance relative to Intel shares.  With continued momentum in the PC market on the back of its Ryzen  processors and increased success in data center with the EPYC product  line, AMD has risen 57% since the start of July. Over that period, Intel  declined 15%. \n\nIn contrast to Nvidia and AMD, Intel is disproportionately associated with  the PC. Yet even within the PC market, analyst commentary has been  overwhelmingly positive on AMD whereas doubts have surfaced over Intel\u2019s  ability to innovate and remain competitive. In the span of a week at  the end of July, Intel announced a major delay with its 7nm chips and  AMD beat Q2 earnings, raised guidance, and hit its highest PC market  share since 2013. However, the focus on Intel as a struggling PC player  has wrongly overlooked several important developments that set the company up for a near-term rebound in PC and [long-term revenue opportunities in the same higher growth end markets that have fueled premium valuations for both Nvidia and AMD](https://blackjacketco.com/f/new-brand-new-intel-growth-ahead-for-tiger-lake-edge-and-av).\u00a0\n\n1. Release of Tiger Lake processor, expanded efforts in graphics via  Xe architecture, and development of discrete GPUs for data center and  desktop\n2. Continued momentum in company shift to data-centric business first and PC business second\n3. Expanded Total Addressable Market (TAM) associated with edge computing and edge-enabled technologies\n4. Competitive positioning in autonomous vehicle technology\n\nIntel is currently priced for stagnant to declining revenues, further market share erosion, and lower  relative probability of success compared to Nvidia and AMD. Given recent  product releases and refreshes, as well as a strong strategic vision to  increase share in these higher growth end markets, Intel revenue is  more likely to accelerate and lead to significant multiple expansion in  the coming years.\u00a0\n\n* Assigning Intel CY23 PT of $125 per share\n* FY23 revenue projected at $100bn\n* FY23 net income projected at $34bn delivering 7.55 in EPS\n* Applying 16.55x P/E and 4.55 P/S\u00a0\n\nFor an in-depth and comprehensive breakdown on Intel's competitive positioning, see below:\n\n**Tiger Lake and Renewed PC Innovation**\u00a0\n\nYesterday  Intel finally revealed the highly anticipated Tiger Lake 11th  generation processors for ultra-thin high-performance laptops. Industry  reporting in previous months had speculated that the new system-on-chip  (SoC \u2013 incorporates different components like graphics and AI into one  integrated unit) would offer CPU performance advances and improvements  in graphics and AI. Intel even leaked some specs on Monday that seemed  to confirm some of the performance metrics. Although independent  industry studies are required to run Tiger Lake through its full paces,  the event demonstrated that not only can Intel still innovate, it is  more than premature to start counting the company out on PCs.\u00a0\n\nTiger  Lake clocks up to 20% higher frequencies compared to the 10th  generation Ice Lake family and can reach a single core turbo of 4.8 GHz.  During the presentation, Intel noted that the integrated Iris Xe  graphics perform better than 90% of PCs sold last year, on-board AI is  up to 5x more effective, and WiFi connectivity is up to 3x faster. In a  like-for-like comparison to AMD, Tiger Lake enabled 4x faster photo  upscaling, 2x faster video processing and exporting via Adobe Pro, and  20% faster performance in both Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. For  gaming, Intel conducted side-by-side tests using Gears Tactics. Laptops  running AMD 4800U with integrated graphics and a Nvidia MX350 discrete  graphics card (with Intel 10th Gen i7) performed worse than Tiger Lake.  Intel\u2019s test showed that Tiger Lake handled the game at up to 66% higher  frames per second versus the AMD and Nvidia-powered laptops.\u00a0\n\nBarring significant discrepancies found during independent reviews, Intel just  delivered performance on 10nm that is equivalent to what is possible on  7nm. With the simultaneous launch of the Evo brand to encompass the new  11th generation-powered ultra-thin high-performance laptop range, Intel  can begin building customer brand recognition and altering perceptions  that Intel has lost competitive footing in the PC market. With 50 PC  designs set to ship with Tiger Lake as soon as this fall, and at least  150 designs anticipated from partner OEMs, Intel may see a very  near-term recovery in its PC market share even despite the 7nm delay.\u00a0 \n\n**Transition to Data-Centric Business and Future at the Edge**\n\nMore  important to Intel\u2019s future is the multi-year shift towards  higher-growth end markets associated with cloud, edge, and data. Rather  than PCs, Intel sees its primary business as the Data-Centric reporting  segment that now comprises 52% of revenues. That figure is likely to  expand in coming quarters following 34% YoY growth in the most recent  earnings report. In FY19 Q2, the Data-Centric segment only accounted for  46% of revenues.\u00a0\n\nThat  Data-Centric segment includes: The Data Center Group (36.3% of total  Intel revenues); Non-Volatile Memory Storage Group (8.5%);  Internet-of-Things Group (3.4%); Programmable Solutions Group (2.6%);  and Mobileye (0.7%). The two largest contributors to the segment are  performing extremely well. The Data Center Group grew 43% YoY and saw  operating income climb 72%. The second largest business in the segment,  Non-Volatile Memory Storage, grew 76% YoY for record revenue on the back  of NAND demand growth and higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs).\u00a0\n\nBy  2024, Intel expects its TAM to reach $300bn. But $230bn of this is  attributed to the Data-Centric TAM. And Intel\u2019s own calculations may be  slightly conservative. In the company\u2019s analysis of its various end  markets, Intel only mentioned the edge compute market in general terms.  Yet that market alone is projected to surpass $100bn by 2030. As much as  public cloud adoption drove demand for server-related products over the  past five years, the edge could end up being a far more important  trend. That is because, in addition to further server demand, the edge  will enable billions of IoT devices to finally become widespread after  years of hype. With TAM growth associated with edge server CPU, GPU, and  storage, plus IoT and edge AI solutions, Intel can achieve growth into  the 2030s so long as the company can execute on its strategic vision. \u00a0\n\n*Edge Server*\u00a0\n\nAn S&amp;P Global study  in spring 2020 estimated that Intel has 90-95% share of the data center  CPU market despite recent share gains by AMD. While edge server  architectures and processes differ versus hyperscale cloud servers, this  figure is testament to the strength of Intel\u2019s relationships with the  leading cloud providers that are also among the early movers in the edge  computing space \u2013 namely Amazon with its Lambda@Edge platform,  Microsoft with Azure Functions, and Google with Google Cloud Functions. \u00a0\n\nFor  smaller edge providers especially, like Fastly, Akamai, or Cloudflare,  there will be particular emphasis on price-per-performance for server  components. Until recently, that dynamic favored AMD whose EPYC Rome  7742 processor rivals Intel\u2019s Xeon Platinum 8280 on performance yet  undercuts it on price by about 60%. The cost efficiency of EPYC led to  some important edge server design wins for AMD, including Cloudflare\u2019s  new GenX server that excluded Intel parts for the first time.\u00a0\n\nThe  latest Xeon processors had been on the market for a couple years,  though, and Intel refreshed the product line earlier this year in an  attempt to greatly reduce cost while maintaining performance. In its 24  February press release, Intel directly addressed the need to become more  competitive with AMD on price-per-performance noting that the Xeon  refresh: \u201c\u2026\\[reinforces\\] Intel\u2019s data center leadership by providing  greater performance and performance-per-dollar choices for\u2026customers  across cloud, network and edge.\u201d While Intel compromised on  compatibility with certain server designs, the result is 1.42x better  price-per-core-performance and a cost of $141 per-core for the Gold  6258R. The price tag puts Xeon in a much stronger position relative to  EPYC Rome 7742 which goes for $108 per-core.\u00a0\n\nDespite  early advantages in cost-per-performance for AMD, Intel still managed  to double its edge deployments year-over-year according to Forbes. And  its impressive partner list includes Lenovo, Red Hat, Advantech,  Caswell, Inventec, Lanner, Nexcom, World Wide Technology, Ericsson, ZTE,  Verizon, Vodafone, Nokia, and China Telecom, among others. With drastic  improvements in price-per-performance, Intel could very well see  additional customer wins in upcoming quarters.\u00a0\n\nBeyond  CPU, edge applications will see an increase in demand for integrated  and hybrid GPUs. Between advancements in Intel Xe graphics and its  development of discrete graphics cards, the company will become better  positioned to take advantage of the more than 33% CAGR projected for  GPUs from 2020 to 2027 \u2013 taking the market from just under $20bn in 2019  to over $200bn according to Deloitte.  Even if Nvidia and AMD maintain large leads over Intel in GPU market  share for edge servers, even a marginal portion of the market could be  meaningful to the Data Center Group which measured around $7bn in Q2.\u00a0\n\nIn  addition, edge servers present an unprecedented opportunity for NAND  solutions as well \u2013 specifically flash storage that utilizes the NVMe  (Non-Volatile Memory Express) protocol. Edge servers have strong need  for high-performance startup operations and extremely reliable storage.  That is because rapid startup times are critical for edge providers to  quickly launch computing instances and deliver the lowest possible  latency for their customers. Improvements in NVMe NAND greatly shrink  the physical storage footprint, reduce power and cooling costs, all the  while improving the overall speed, flexibility, and failure rates. And  Intel Optane and 3D NAND SSDs are exceptionally reliable for storage and  offer performance improvements over legacy storage solutions.\u00a0\n\n*IoT and AI*\n\nMuch  like edge servers, edge deployed IoT devices will similarly boost  demand for Intel processors. For workload intensive industrial IoT,  Intel has its Core processor. And the Intel Atom processor is  purpose-built for lower-power or embedded applications. Because IoT  devices will collect and process vast amounts of data, these  applications will also require significant amounts of flash memory \u2013  specifically NAND. On-device NAND SSD can increase data transfer speeds  while also integrating module-level security features, remote  management, and more flexible power configurations. Collectively,  improvements in NAND will lower total cost of ownership for these  machines. \u00a0\n\nThe edge will lead  to rapid growth for edge AI chipsets that enable IoT devices to deploy  machine learning at the edge without having to send data via internet  back to a centralized data center. Deloitte notes that around 300  million edge AI chips were sold in 2017, but this year could see more  than 750 million units hit the market. With compounded annual growth in  edge AI chipsets anticipated to outpace the broader semiconductor  industry by a considerable amount, ABI research predicts that these edge chips will surpass the market for cloud AI chips by 2025 \u2013 marking a massive shift.\u00a0\n\n**Mobileye and Autonomous Driving Technology**\u00a0\n\nIt  is interesting the extent to which mainstream conversations in media  and financial commentary largely exclude Intel\u2019s Mobileye and instead  focus on Tesla as the technology leader in autonomous vehicles and  Nvidia as the chipmaker best positioned to disrupt. Although Telsa  claims to offer autonomous modes for its vehicles, based on the 5-level  autonomous capability hierarchy \u2013 the industry standard established by  the Society of Automotive Engineers \u2013 the most advanced cars currently  on the market only operate at level 2+. Level 2+ falls between levels 2  (partial automation) and 3 (conditional automation). The hardware to  support full level 5 autonomy does exist in 2020, and the software  necessary to manage these systems is not too far behind. However, it  will likely take 5-7 years before manufacturing volumes reach levels to  drive down hardware prices, the necessary regulatory frameworks come  into place, and fully autonomous vehicles gain broad consumer  acceptance. \u00a0\n\nIn the  intermediary period, the progression towards level 5 autonomy will  continue to be gradual and incremental. Higher degrees of autonomy will  be achieved by increasingly sophisticated advanced driver assistance  systems (ADAS) that prove out the viability of these technologies and  underpin the manufacturing, regulatory, and consumer environment that  will facilitate the future arrival of self-driving cars. Beyond this, in  many cases the same technology at the center of levels 4 and 5 builds  on the existing foundations of ADAS capabilities. And the dominant  player in the ADAS market is not Tesla, Waymo, or Nvidia. It is  Mobileye.\u00a0\n\nMobileye\u2019s market  share has consistently stayed above 70% for years, even as competition  from other players has ramped up \u2013 Nvidia in particular. The Mobileye  solution is noteworthy, pairing its SoC \u2013 the EyeQ family \u2013 to support a  range of ADAS capabilities using only a single camera sensor. This  differs from the LiDAR and radar-based systems favored by Waymo, Uber,  GM-owned Cruise, and Nvidia. Tesla \u2013 who previously used Mobileye  technology until the two parted ways in 2016 \u2013 also leverages a  camera-based system. However, Tesla deploys ultrasonic sensors and  radars in combination with billions of miles of driver data.\u00a0\n\nMobileye\u2019s  commanding market share in ADAS means that its technology is used by  more than 300 models from 25 global automakers, resulting in 60 million  vehicles on the road worldwide. In contrast, Tesla currently has fewer  than 1 million vehicles on the road equipped with variants of its  autopilot technology. And Mobileye is already working with 4 major OEMs  to soon provide level 3 autonomous solutions.

Even after holding the intel stock for 18 years, You made nothing.** Your return on investment was 0%.\n\n**4 case study**\n\nTiming is the most important factor in investing. To make money, you need to buy the right stock at the right price. You need both things. If you buy the right stock at the wrong price, you lose your money. Here I provide 4 case studies of four different stocks namely Nvidia, Tesla, Intel, and AMD. You will find out, how timing plays a role in investment.

Many investors have a notion of buy right and sit tight. But you can clearly see, investment should not be passive. You should always have an eye on your portfolio. Trim your poor performing stocks. Let the winners ride. In this intel stock case, your money would be just sitting idle for 18 years.\n\n*#3 NVDA (Nvidia)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime period - 2008 to 2016 ( 9 years)\n\nNvidia, a graphics card company ( symbol - NVDA) took 9 years to reach the high of 2008. It was in 2016, the stock reached the 2008 high. It would be more sensible to invest in NVDA, in 2016 with a predefined risk, than in 2008. Therefore, it's of paramount importance for investors to understand the importance of timing while making investing decisions.\n\n*#4 TSLA (Tesla)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime period - 2014 to 2019 ( 6 years)\n\nTesla( symbol - TSLA), most popular stock.

If you don't have one, your investment won't make any return for years. Therefore, the right timing of investment is very important.\n\n**Investors-**\n\nThe majority of investors lose money. but why?\n\n**1. Hope** \u2014 every investor have a self-serving bias. They always think, their investment will make great returns. even if they buy the wrong stocks at the wrong time. most investors don\u2019t do their homework themselves. They keep asking others what to buy. Suppose they bought some stock at $100. After some days, if it trades at $60. They don\u2019t square off their position even if the portfolio is down by 40%. They keep hallucinating, that the stock will go up. There is no place of hope in the stock market.\n\n**2. Plan B** \u2014 most investors don\u2019t have a plan B. They are the ones who keep losing money. They either buy stock at the wrong time or the wrong price. Every investor should have plan B. They should predefine their maximum risk with respect to their investment in stocks. This will help investors tremendously.\n\n**3. Investing system** \u2014 would you invest in stock for 20 years? What would be your expectations regarding these investments, 5X, 10X, 50X, or how much? ***But have you thought why your stock will rise?*** Do you have an investing system?

Therefore, the right timing of investment is very important.\n\n**Investors-**\n\nThe majority of investors lose money. but why?\n\n**1. Hope** \u2014 every investor have a self-serving bias. They always think, their investment will make great returns. even if they buy the wrong stocks at the wrong time. most investors don\u2019t do their homework themselves. They keep asking others what to buy. Suppose they bought some stock at $100. After some days, if it trades at $60. They don\u2019t square off their position even if the portfolio is down by 40%. They keep hallucinating, that the stock will go up. There is no place of hope in the stock market.\n\n**2. Plan B** \u2014 most investors don\u2019t have a plan B. They are the ones who keep losing money. They either buy stock at the wrong time or the wrong price. Every investor should have plan B. They should predefine their maximum risk with respect to their investment in stocks. This will help investors tremendously.\n\n**3. Investing system** \u2014 would you invest in stock for 20 years? What would be your expectations regarding these investments, 5X, 10X, 50X, or how much? ***But have you thought why your stock will rise?*** Do you have an investing system? Investing system will help you highly in managing your risk thereby cutting losses and riding your winner stocks. **Every investor should have an investing system**.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 812579, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Timing is super important in investing", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iis8ab/timing_is_super_important_in_investing/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1598703479.0}], [[], false, "LifeTaylor", null, [], null, "text", "t2_4aney77r", false, false, [], false, false, 1598555867, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ihrhja/stock_trading_is_more_enjoyable_with_fractional/", {}, "ihrhja", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "advice", [], "823be0a6-65e6-11e5-9784-125ee764bc01", "Advice", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 8, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/ihrhja/stock_trading_is_more_enjoyable_with_fractional/", false, 6, 1598555878, 1, "As a first time trader, or someone who doesn't have bucket-loads of cash available, fractional shares is a bit revolutionary to me..\n\nI now no longer think \"I want to buy X stocks of X\" \n\nMy thinking is \"I want to buy $100 of ____ \"\n\nThis means every month I can just look at whatever money I want to invest and be like \"Hmm, I'll buy $50 of INTC, $100 of MSFT, $100 of AMZN, and then i'll throw the rest in something else\"\n\n\nOn the flip side, when selling stocks, its not \"I want to sell X number of stocks\"  its \"I want to withdraw/sell $100\"\n\nIt just makes a whole lot more sense, and makes me feel more comfortable about stock trading in general.\n\n\nJust thought i'd put this here, since I think a lot of people are fearful to buy expensive stocks.

next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who\u2019ve been paying attention. Today I\u2019d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they\u2019ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future.\n\n**Lithography techniques**\n\nLithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [\\[1\\]](http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html).\n\nOver time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area \u2013 this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling\\[2\\]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you\u2019re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to \u2018print\u2019 the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn\u2019t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem \u2013 patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its\u2019 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its\u2019 10nm process.\\[3\\] Meanwhile, its\u2019 competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. \\[4\\] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice\u2026\n\nOther terminology I\u2019ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together)\n\n**The problems with 10nm**\n\nBack in 2013, Intel was in it\u2019s prime. It dominated the CPU market with &gt;90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its\u2019 chips \u2013 every two years you would have a die shrink \u2018tick\u2019, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change \u2018tock\u2019. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next \u2018tock\u2019 of 10nm in 2016. The \u2018tick\u2019 \u2013 Skylake architecture came, but the \u2018tock\u2019 never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn\u2019t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 \u2013 but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the \u2018mass-market\u2019 generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel\u2019s own 14nm offerings. \\[5\\] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 \u2013 but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure.    When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn\u2019t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it \u2013 you\u2019re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm \u2013 this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it\u2019s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD\u2019s chiplet approach, built on TSMC\u2019s less defect-prone EUV process. \n\n(Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here)  \n\n\nSince you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that \n\n1) they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS\n\n2) The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD\u2019s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. \n\nThese are bold statements but I believe Intel\u2019s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view.\n\nWhen you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be \u2018better\u2019 than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can\u2019t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture \\[6\\], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would\u2019ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete \u2013 there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its\u2019 double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28,  will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm \\[7\\] \u2013 not to mention AMD\u2019s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.\\[8\\] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on \u201810nm+++\u2019, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken.\n\n**7nm and beyond**\n\nSo now we\u2019ve established just how much of a disaster Intel\u2019s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its\u2019 built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel\u2019s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the \u20186 month delay\u2019 in 7nm rollout. While I don\u2019t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were \u2018we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm\u2026 12 months behind our internal target\u2026 we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation\u2019. \n\nThere\u2019s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob\u2019s claim of a \u2018buffer in planning process\u2019 as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed \u2013 running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don\u2019t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process \u2013 that\u2019s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob\u2019s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they\u2019re going to breach industry standard and \u2018launch\u2019 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel \u2018launched\u2019 Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.\\[9\\] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake \u2018launched\u2019. This \u20186-month\u2019 delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays).\n\nThe second part of the comment, relating to a \u2018defect mode\u2019, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. \\[10\\] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history \u2013 the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a \u2018working prototype\u2019 demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. \\[11\\] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. \n\n\\[12\\] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the \u2018defect mode\u2019 Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is.\n\nBeyond 7nm, there are some positives to be [found.](http://found.as/) As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI\u2019ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its\u2019 own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] [http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html](http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html) \n\n\\[2\\][Dennard,  R., Gaensslen, F., Hwa-Nien Yu, Rideout, V., Bassous, E. and Leblanc,  A., 1999.

For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture \\[6\\], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would\u2019ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete \u2013 there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its\u2019 double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28,  will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm \\[7\\] \u2013 not to mention AMD\u2019s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.\\[8\\] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on \u201810nm+++\u2019, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken.\n\n**7nm and beyond**\n\nSo now we\u2019ve established just how much of a disaster Intel\u2019s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its\u2019 built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel\u2019s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the \u20186 month delay\u2019 in 7nm rollout. While I don\u2019t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were \u2018we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm\u2026 12 months behind our internal target\u2026 we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation\u2019. \n\nThere\u2019s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob\u2019s claim of a \u2018buffer in planning process\u2019 as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed \u2013 running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don\u2019t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process \u2013 that\u2019s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob\u2019s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they\u2019re going to breach industry standard and \u2018launch\u2019 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel \u2018launched\u2019 Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.\\[9\\] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake \u2018launched\u2019. This \u20186-month\u2019 delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays).\n\nThe second part of the comment, relating to a \u2018defect mode\u2019, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. \\[10\\] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history \u2013 the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a \u2018working prototype\u2019 demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. \\[11\\] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. \n\n\\[12\\] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the \u2018defect mode\u2019 Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is.\n\nBeyond 7nm, there are some positives to be [found.](http://found.as/) As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI\u2019ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its\u2019 own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] [http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html](http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html) \n\n\\[2\\][Dennard,  R., Gaensslen, F., Hwa-Nien Yu, Rideout, V., Bassous, E. and Leblanc,  A., 1999.

In any case, there's a million AMD vs Intel threads and so I'm not going to get into that topic further here. Instead, I want talk about NVidia.\n\nWhen NVidia crossed Intel's market cap, I think that especially value investors (like myself) got even more concerned about NVidia valuation being in bubble territory (I hold NVidia in my portfolio). However, the problem with these \"backward looking\" assessments comparing two different companies is that we don't really know the future, and can't therefore make predictions based on the past (duh). For example, Wall Street tried to value Apple given the iPhone launch back in 2007. They were basing the total addressable smartphone market on what Nokia was selling at the time.

Lots of people are still messaging me about the energy sector post, especially for the ENPH tip, so I'm here to show my portfolio. I don't own all companies yet, this is partially hypothetical. I'm holding on to a reasonable cash position for a possible new downturn, but I have starting positions in most companies and will DCA.\n\nI will try to keep it summarized, as I have done quite a lot of analysis on each of them. I'll draw the main picture and give the most important arguments for my choices, but I'm not expanding too much. If you're interested, you can DM me to talk about them more.\n\nLet me start by saying I'm a growth investor. I always look for a combination of growth with a great track record, if possible at a reasonable price. There are exceptions as you will see below, but the main balance stays the same. I'm not a defensive investor, but no aggressive one either. My timeline is 2-5 years at least (due to a possible start of a small business), but I would gladly hold on to these companies 10+ years.\n\nTLDR; For you guys not interested in my portfolio, I've added a short list of interesting smaller cap companies at the end, most of them trading at decent values.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES - $AMD**\n\nThis one is becoming a blue chip, but has more than enough growth potential to live up to those high valuations. Preferred by gamers and beating their biggest competitor in the CPU market hard. While AMD and INTC were close competitors at the beginning of the 21st century, INTC took the lead by a lot. Since 2017, they introduced 7nm CPU's and GPU's and they are closing the gap fast. Not only are their chips more performant, they are also cheaper. Market cap $60B vs $261b.\n\nThose next generation chips lead them to new partnerships, often beating INTC. Microsoft, a long time Intel customer, began using AMD chips in their Surface laptops. Lenovo using AMD for their new servers. Nvidia started using the chips in their AI products. AMD is also used by Apple's high-end laptops, while Intel (used in the budget range) will probably get replaced by Apple chips made in-house. Apart from laptops, AMD has government contracts to deliver supercomputers in 2021/2023 and they are used in both PS and XBOX consoles, to give a few examples.\n\nFor the CPU market, AMD is destined to take over, but they're also taking on NVDA for their GPU's. They have been catching up for years and in 2019 they finally made a better performing GPU in the $350-400 price range. There is a possibility to gain GPU market cap since NVDA has been pushing their prices due to the lack of competition. Therefore, with AMD stepping up their game, they need to give up market share or lower their margins.\n\n**Financial**\n\nAssets over liabilities are x1.88. Cash to debt ratio well above industry average, debt to EBITDA well below IA. ROE 17.12% and ROIC 28.06%. Earnings were growing fast before Covid (125% in Q3, 78% in Q4). Yes they're overvalued, but with their future outlook, I would always buy below $49.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nNow that they are done catching up, the question is, will they outperform in the future. To gain more market share of Nvidia, they need to be better, not equally good. AMD also needs to control the heating better, as it is one of their long term problems.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**MASTERCARD - $MA**\n\nFintech companies like SQ and PYPL are a great investment. However, a lot of big companies will (and already did) implement online financial services. MA is able to easily work with multiple of those companies and they're using their global presence pretty well, that's why they're my pick for the fintech industry.\n\nThey launched Mastercard Accelerate last year, implementing those online paying platforms and letting start-ups take advantage of their global presence to grow and transform very fast. Last year they acquired Ethoca (managing e-commerce fraud) and Vyze (platform to connect merchants with multiple renders, giving them the opportunity to get those financial needs for start-ups). MA is basically helping start-ups to grow faster, which will result in more financial transactions in the future.\n\nLast but not least, they like to focus on expanding to countries where there isn't much competition yet. They are expanding their exposure to Middle East and Africa, working with local networks and e-commerce platforms. They are in a strong position to capitalize those regions in the future and take on market leader Visa even more.\n\nThey get compared a lot to Visa, so I'll expand on that subject a bit as well. While V is focussing on performance and speed, MA plays the cyber security card. They are already working on ways to implement cryptocurrency and Mastercard tend to have more growth potential vs stability from market leader Visa. While V is in the lead, MA is more widely used by fintech companies, which shows potential take-over in the future. Next to their credit services, they also own debit service Maestro, which is widely used in Europe.\n\n**Financial**\n\nReturns as high as 150% (ROE) and 60% (ROIC). Very large margins and perfectly stable balance sheet. High EPS growth YoY, 53% and 42% in the last two years. Quick ratio 1.87. V has more assets and even bigger margins, however MA wins in returns and cash. In terms of more growth, I like to focus on those last numbers more.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nIt's a blue chip at a $300B market cap. Their growth potential might be limited, although I see them as one of the better picks between blue chips.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**ENPHASE ENERGY - $ENPH**\n\nI already talked about solar energy in another post, so I'm gonna skip the explanation. As some of you know my choices were ENPH and SEDG, so I'll explain a bit about why I choose ENPH here. Mainly it's because of their financials, so I'll dive that straight away.\n\nQuick ratio - 2.35 vs 1.74\n\nROE - 142.94% vs 21.51%\n\nROIC - 85.51% vs 25.81%\n\nNet margin - 25.81% vs 10.28%\n\nHowever I think SEDG balance sheet is a lot better and safer, ENPH is working on their future more efficient. They are paving the way smoothly with bigger margins and return on investments. Although SEDG might be the better pick right now, ENPH will be the better one in a short while. ENPH is also a bit less overvalued and their PEG ratio is lower, which makes them the better pick to get in right now.\n\nDiving into the products as well, ENPH just has the better and more efficient product. Their micro inverters are more durable (20 vs 12 years) and give the chance to increase or decrease the amount of solar panels easily, depending on your personal situation.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**GALAPAGOS - $GLPG**\n\nI'm not a big fan of biotech companies, but these guys have my attention. Not because they're working on Covid vaccines, but because of two reasons. First one is them getting back-up from Gilead Sciences. That's the push they needed to start operating worldwide, increasing their potential market cap. Now that they have the cash from GILD, they can keep on buying interesting divisions and increase their growth. While having almost no long term debt, they are set pretty well with about $4 billion extra in cash.\n\nSecond, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases, with Filgotinib as their biggest one. They had a setback on those results, but the company is very confident, giving an opportunity to get them at a decent price. I wouldn't be surprised if they partner up with another big pharmaceutical company in the metabolic disease section.\n\n**Financial**\n\nHigh PE (84 vs 44 average), but PEG ratio is 1.2. Quick ratio 9.28. ROIC 75.91% and ROE 7%. Became profitable this year with 16.25% net margin. 38.7% YoY EPS growth.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nLike all biotech players, there's a lot depending on medicines getting through phase trials and being commercialized. If Filgotinib will fail, their stock will obviously fall. However since they are backed by a big US giant, they can commercialize the product faster and on a bigger global scale if trials succeed. That's what gives them the advantage in comparison to other biotech companies for me.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**WALT DISNEY - $DIS**\n\nThis one has got me doubting a lot. I've taken them off and put them back on my list multiple times, but eventually I decided to keep them at least 2 years to see how they will evolve into streaming.\n\nBiggest advantage they have on their competitors is they basically have a monopoly on kids entertainment. Kids are growing up with electronic devices and content, so they're creating customers at a very young age. That's how Coca Cola used to work. They targeted 14-16 year olds, dumping loads of money into advertising which resulted in life long customers, as people didn't change cola brands often.\n\nDisney+ is a big hit and they won't get so much competition from other streaming services as Netflix and Roku will. They have one of the strongest defined brands out there and they know perfectly how to build and maintain their company. It's also still unclear how sports with public will evolve, but it's certain streaming will become even bigger after Covid. Therefore their money-losing ESPN acquisition could even turn into a moneymaker.\n\n**Financial**\n\nI can't really say great things about their financials. ROE is 12.67%, above 10% is decent. Assets over liabilities are x1.85 and debt to equity is 0.61. You could apply the saying \"too big to fail' here, but that's about it. The bad financials are mainly caused by their big investment to streaming of course and they're working on it hard. They doubled their cash position, increasing their quick ratio from 0.75 to 0.89.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nI would say financials are their weak point here. They still have to go through some bad weather this and next year I would say. Them doubling their cash position in Q1 was soothing, as I see it being the biggest issue for the future. It might be better to wait it out and keep an eye on them for next year, but I wanted to take a position already. Not higher than 8% of my portfolio though.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**MICROSOFT - $MSFT**\n\nThey don't really an introduction I guess. 2nd biggest player for cloud services with Azure. Naming Satya Nadella as CEO and making the transition from hardware to software in 2014 were the best decisions they could've made. Acquired the government contract with Pentagon, however there's still uncertainty about it. In short, Amazon is claiming they were about to win the contract, but Trump criticizing the company would've lead to calling off the deal. For me, that's probably the main reason why MSFT didn't fly as high as their fellow cloud competitors yet.\n\n**Financial**\n\nAssets over liabilities x1.67. ROE and ROIC respectively at 43.82% and 28.88%. Quick ratio of 2.88, 0.65 debt to equity and 1.86 cash to debt. Decent financials, great returns. Talking about blue chips, I would say MSFT is still fairly valued with a PEG ratio just below industry average. Also paying a small dividend.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nThe Pentagon contract allegations could be pretty negative for the company. They will probably not come back on their decision, cause if they do, MSFT will claim they already made big investments towards them and things will just keep on dragging on. Even without the contract, MSFT should be a 10 year hold while buying on dips.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**INNOVATIVE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES - $IIPR**\n\nHaven't read a lot about them here on Reddit, but they're a very decent investment. Basically, they buy properties from cannabis companies and leases them back to the sellers, giving them the cash they need to grow faster and IIPR keeps the long term advantage of renting out those properties. They need to buy about 6-8 properties a year to keep their growth rate going and they already bought 7 this year. They still have a lot of cash ready to take advantage of the crisis.\n\nNot only are they 20% undervalued right now, they have a lot more growth potential after that and on top of it, they pay close to 5% dividend. I'm not a big fan of betting on the best cannabis company for the future, but IIPR is a great buy to have exposure in that industry. It doesn't happen very often I come across a company that combines growth potential with a high dividend, but IIPR does.\n\n**Financial**\n\nQuick ratio 6.75, cash to debt 2.8 (while REITs have an 0.07 average). Net margins 13% above average. Assets over liabilities x4.88. Annual EPS growing by more than 150% and about 41% in the last quarter before Covid. They just missed Q1 estimates, but it was only an 8% drop from Q4, performing way better than other REITs.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nIIPR has held a lot of new investment rounds, diluting shares. Of course extra capital will result in higher growth and will eventually be positive in the long run. There has been a drop in these last few days due to the announcement of selling 1 million more shares soon. I would look at it as an opportunity to get an even better price on them.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**TELADOC HEALTH - $TDOC**\n\nIt's the only company I don't own yet. I can't force myself to invest more than $140 per share for them, although I really like their business model. A lot of people are skipping doctors visits these days, going straight away to get medicines and counting on the advice of pharmacists. A lot of times, there's more examination needed.\n\nNot only do I see them succeeding in their field, I see them as an essential part of the automation of the pharmacy industry. It's a useful tool in emergencies, giving advice and deciding how serious the condition is, if (fast) medical care is needed. Teladoc will also play a role in insurance and giving the employers a checking tool. 98.9% of their shares are owned by institutions.\n\n**Financial**\n\nIn terms of profitability and returns, not great of course. They are estimated to get profitable in 2023. Great balance sheet, assets over liabilities x2.66. Quick ratio 6.14, cash to debt 1.06, debt to equity 0.48.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nIt's hard to see if a company is well managed before they are profitable. Their moat isn't very narrow, however I feel being one of the first ones gives you a big advantage in this field.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**DRAFTKINGS - $DKNG**\n\nGonna keep this one pretty short, there has been enough posts about Donkey Kong. For me, the most important factor for choosing them in this industry is their fantasy sports section. They are widely popular and that division will only get more interesting while online gambling, and especially in-game betting, gets more and more legalized in the US.\n\nAlthough they realized major revenue growth in 2019, they almost doubled their earnings loss. Main reason of course having to develop their platform and system. Good thing is, their technology is highly scalable, meaning they margin will grow massively while expanding in to more states and countries. Not many ratios available yet, so that's about the only financial information I own atm.\n\nThe only negative I see is their pretty wide moat, so this one should be monitored more closely in the future. But for now, they have the momentum and are one of the most popular choices, great investment.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES - $RTX**\n\nAs many of you know, two great companies (UTC and RTN) merged together in April. While United focussed on aircraft engines (Pratt &amp; Whitney), Raytheon manufactured weapons, military and commercial electronics. They always delivered advanced technologies and them gaining multiple government contracts in the last decade is confirmation of their performant products.\n\nRaytheon will continue to grow their leadership in different segments. Because of their diversity, they seem perfectly in place to grow even more into an aerospace &amp; defense giant. Engines, aerostructures, avionics, sensors, cybersecurity and other software solutions are just a few examples of their working fields.\n\n**Financial**\n\nWith a PE ratio of 13.58 and PB ratio of 1.41, this is probably the most undervalued stock in my portfolio. Assets over liabilities x1.43. The rest of their financials isn't that great. UTC was carrying a lot of debt, but because of the merger, it will be better balanced as RTN was only carrying $2 billion net debt. If they can decrease their debt and optimize their merger, they are set to be the new number one in defense.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nIt's still unclear how the merger will work out financially and logistically. In theory, they should be very well armed (pun intended) to take on LMT as market leader. Their exposure to commercial aircrafts is also a big threat, but it's less of an issue because they can make up with their other practices.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nAs you can see, I've tried to get the best blue chips with still some growth potential and stable growth companies together. Since a lot of companies already got mentioned on this forum, I'll include a bonus round of interesting companies I came across during my search for the best companies. I didn't include them in my portfolio mainly because I feel the chance of them succeeding and living up to their future potential is more risky than others. For you looking for higher risk, higher reward, check out these companies below.\n\n* **$INMD.** They offer minimally-invasive aesthetic medical products for various procedures, such as liposuction with simultaneous skin tightening, body and face contouring. They are actually the only company in my watchlist that scored maximum on my financial checklist. I love to watch their financials. While we're in an overvalued market, INMD has only 18.73 PE and 0.6 PEG. They certainly got hit by Covid, but I would be very surprised if they don't multiply their market share over the next years.\n* **$SMCI.** Based mainly on servers and storage solutions. They are the supplier for cloud computing and AI based companies. They were ranked 18th fastest growing company by Fortune Magazine in 2016, but they still have a long way possible to grow. I see them stagnating a bit for a few years, but they definitely have potential in the long run. Financially very stable, big on cash to make some acquisitions and trading at only 14.84 PE.\n* **$CDLX.** Great business model. They basically turn financial transaction data into valuable information for advertising. They show returns as high as 30:1 for advertising spent. Not only is the online payment industry growing fast, but after Covid companies will need to work their advertising budgets even more efficiently. CDLX has momentum and will increase that market cap massively. That future outlook has a price unfortunately and I feel they're too expensive right now.\n* **$OLED.** They hold patents on ultra high definition OLED screen technology. There's still a large transition going on from LED to OLED screens. They are estimated to increase their manufacturing with 50% by the end of 2021. Unfortunately most of that growth is already priced in right now. It doesn't take away the longer term potential, but it doesn't make it that sexy of a buy right now.\n* **$OMCL.** Omnicell provides pharmacy automation solutions and other tools for healthcare systems. Big on cash, low on debt. They have an interesting business and the automation of healthcare will continue to grow, however they are also trading a bit above value.\n* **$PCOM.** A technology company based on e-commerce and services through loyalty programs. Most of their partners are airlines, which explains their difficulties of getting back up since the drop. At the moment it's unsure how this will work out. There will barely be room for bargains or rewards, however while the industry has to build up again, there's an opportunity to take away long time customers from competitors. Although they have enough cash to weather this crisis, they are depending on the industry. At PE below 10 and having a decent cash position, it's worth a gamble.\n* **$APPS.** Digital Turbine offers a mobile platform mainly for new apps. They have a very high future revenue forecast of 202.2% over the next 3 years. Big on cash and no debt as well. They already acquired Mobile Posse in March, diversifying their platform. Analysts are putting an average price target of $9.88 on them, giving it a 61% potential return.\n* **$NVMI.** They develop and produce process control systems used in the manufacturing of semiconductors, mainly focussing on industrializing X-ray and optical technologies like holographic images. Cash to debt 6.1, debt to equity 0.1, quick ratio 5.75, ROE 12.83% and ROIC 20.26%. Their financials are great. The only thing you could say is they are slightly overvalued, but still a very nice buy in comparison to the overvalued tech industry.\n* **$INS.** Active in the fintech sector, they provide tech solutions and processing services. Very similar financials to NVMI. Big on cash, almost no long term debt, great returns (ROE 29.7% / ROIC 85.95%)  and steady growing EPS. They are also slightly overvalued, but should easily get back to $45 range after the crisis is over.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nSo, that's about all I have to share. This will also be my last big post a while. Analyzing stocks has been my main occupation for the last three months, but it's time to work on opening up the hotel and bar again. I hope some of you get something out of this. I'm not a professional so always check again for yourself. I'm gonna hold on to these companies for a while now. Will add some extra capital at the beginning of 2021, so you could expect another big post about my newest findings then.

Mainly it's because of their financials, so I'll dive that straight away.\n\nQuick ratio - 2.35 vs 1.74\n\nROE - 142.94% vs 21.51%\n\nROIC - 85.51% vs 25.81%\n\nNet margin - 25.81% vs 10.28%\n\nHowever I think SEDG balance sheet is a lot better and safer, ENPH is working on their future more efficient. They are paving the way smoothly with bigger margins and return on investments. Although SEDG might be the better pick right now, ENPH will be the better one in a short while. ENPH is also a bit less overvalued and their PEG ratio is lower, which makes them the better pick to get in right now.\n\nDiving into the products as well, ENPH just has the better and more efficient product. Their micro inverters are more durable (20 vs 12 years) and give the chance to increase or decrease the amount of solar panels easily, depending on your personal situation.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**GALAPAGOS - $GLPG**\n\nI'm not a big fan of biotech companies, but these guys have my attention. Not because they're working on Covid vaccines, but because of two reasons. First one is them getting back-up from Gilead Sciences. That's the push they needed to start operating worldwide, increasing their potential market cap. Now that they have the cash from GILD, they can keep on buying interesting divisions and increase their growth. While having almost no long term debt, they are set pretty well with about $4 billion extra in cash.\n\nSecond, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases, with Filgotinib as their biggest one. They had a setback on those results, but the company is very confident, giving an opportunity to get them at a decent price. I wouldn't be surprised if they partner up with another big pharmaceutical company in the metabolic disease section.\n\n**Financial**\n\nHigh PE (84 vs 44 average), but PEG ratio is 1.2. Quick ratio 9.28. ROIC 75.91% and ROE 7%. Became profitable this year with 16.25% net margin. 38.7% YoY EPS growth.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nLike all biotech players, there's a lot depending on medicines getting through phase trials and being commercialized. If Filgotinib will fail, their stock will obviously fall. However since they are backed by a big US giant, they can commercialize the product faster and on a bigger global scale if trials succeed. That's what gives them the advantage in comparison to other biotech companies for me.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**WALT DISNEY - $DIS**\n\nThis one has got me doubting a lot. I've taken them off and put them back on my list multiple times, but eventually I decided to keep them at least 2 years to see how they will evolve into streaming.\n\nBiggest advantage they have on their competitors is they basically have a monopoly on kids entertainment. Kids are growing up with electronic devices and content, so they're creating customers at a very young age. That's how Coca Cola used to work. They targeted 14-16 year olds, dumping loads of money into advertising which resulted in life long customers, as people didn't change cola brands often.\n\nDisney+ is a big hit and they won't get so much competition from other streaming services as Netflix and Roku will. They have one of the strongest defined brands out there and they know perfectly how to build and maintain their company. It's also still unclear how sports with public will evolve, but it's certain streaming will become even bigger after Covid. Therefore their money-losing ESPN acquisition could even turn into a moneymaker.\n\n**Financial**\n\nI can't really say great things about their financials. ROE is 12.67%, above 10% is decent. Assets over liabilities are x1.85 and debt to equity is 0.61. You could apply the saying \"too big to fail' here, but that's about it. The bad financials are mainly caused by their big investment to streaming of course and they're working on it hard. They doubled their cash position, increasing their quick ratio from 0.75 to 0.89.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nI would say financials are their weak point here. They still have to go through some bad weather this and next year I would say. Them doubling their cash position in Q1 was soothing, as I see it being the biggest issue for the future. It might be better to wait it out and keep an eye on them for next year, but I wanted to take a position already. Not higher than 8% of my portfolio though.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**MICROSOFT - $MSFT**\n\nThey don't really an introduction I guess. 2nd biggest player for cloud services with Azure. Naming Satya Nadella as CEO and making the transition from hardware to software in 2014 were the best decisions they could've made. Acquired the government contract with Pentagon, however there's still uncertainty about it. In short, Amazon is claiming they were about to win the contract, but Trump criticizing the company would've lead to calling off the deal. For me, that's probably the main reason why MSFT didn't fly as high as their fellow cloud competitors yet.\n\n**Financial**\n\nAssets over liabilities x1.67. ROE and ROIC respectively at 43.82% and 28.88%. Quick ratio of 2.88, 0.65 debt to equity and 1.86 cash to debt. Decent financials, great returns. Talking about blue chips, I would say MSFT is still fairly valued with a PEG ratio just below industry average. Also paying a small dividend.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nThe Pentagon contract allegations could be pretty negative for the company. They will probably not come back on their decision, cause if they do, MSFT will claim they already made big investments towards them and things will just keep on dragging on. Even without the contract, MSFT should be a 10 year hold while buying on dips.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**INNOVATIVE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES - $IIPR**\n\nHaven't read a lot about them here on Reddit, but they're a very decent investment. Basically, they buy properties from cannabis companies and leases them back to the sellers, giving them the cash they need to grow faster and IIPR keeps the long term advantage of renting out those properties. They need to buy about 6-8 properties a year to keep their growth rate going and they already bought 7 this year. They still have a lot of cash ready to take advantage of the crisis.\n\nNot only are they 20% undervalued right now, they have a lot more growth potential after that and on top of it, they pay close to 5% dividend. I'm not a big fan of betting on the best cannabis company for the future, but IIPR is a great buy to have exposure in that industry. It doesn't happen very often I come across a company that combines growth potential with a high dividend, but IIPR does.\n\n**Financial**\n\nQuick ratio 6.75, cash to debt 2.8 (while REITs have an 0.07 average). Net margins 13% above average. Assets over liabilities x4.88. Annual EPS growing by more than 150% and about 41% in the last quarter before Covid. They just missed Q1 estimates, but it was only an 8% drop from Q4, performing way better than other REITs.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nIIPR has held a lot of new investment rounds, diluting shares. Of course extra capital will result in higher growth and will eventually be positive in the long run. There has been a drop in these last few days due to the announcement of selling 1 million more shares soon. I would look at it as an opportunity to get an even better price on them.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**TELADOC HEALTH - $TDOC**\n\nIt's the only company I don't own yet. I can't force myself to invest more than $140 per share for them, although I really like their business model. A lot of people are skipping doctors visits these days, going straight away to get medicines and counting on the advice of pharmacists. A lot of times, there's more examination needed.\n\nNot only do I see them succeeding in their field, I see them as an essential part of the automation of the pharmacy industry. It's a useful tool in emergencies, giving advice and deciding how serious the condition is, if (fast) medical care is needed. Teladoc will also play a role in insurance and giving the employers a checking tool. 98.9% of their shares are owned by institutions.\n\n**Financial**\n\nIn terms of profitability and returns, not great of course. They are estimated to get profitable in 2023. Great balance sheet, assets over liabilities x2.66. Quick ratio 6.14, cash to debt 1.06, debt to equity 0.48.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nIt's hard to see if a company is well managed before they are profitable. Their moat isn't very narrow, however I feel being one of the first ones gives you a big advantage in this field.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**DRAFTKINGS - $DKNG**\n\nGonna keep this one pretty short, there has been enough posts about Donkey Kong. For me, the most important factor for choosing them in this industry is their fantasy sports section. They are widely popular and that division will only get more interesting while online gambling, and especially in-game betting, gets more and more legalized in the US.\n\nAlthough they realized major revenue growth in 2019, they almost doubled their earnings loss. Main reason of course having to develop their platform and system. Good thing is, their technology is highly scalable, meaning they margin will grow massively while expanding in to more states and countries. Not many ratios available yet, so that's about the only financial information I own atm.\n\nThe only negative I see is their pretty wide moat, so this one should be monitored more closely in the future. But for now, they have the momentum and are one of the most popular choices, great investment.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\n**RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES - $RTX**\n\nAs many of you know, two great companies (UTC and RTN) merged together in April. While United focussed on aircraft engines (Pratt &amp; Whitney), Raytheon manufactured weapons, military and commercial electronics. They always delivered advanced technologies and them gaining multiple government contracts in the last decade is confirmation of their performant products.\n\nRaytheon will continue to grow their leadership in different segments. Because of their diversity, they seem perfectly in place to grow even more into an aerospace &amp; defense giant. Engines, aerostructures, avionics, sensors, cybersecurity and other software solutions are just a few examples of their working fields.\n\n**Financial**\n\nWith a PE ratio of 13.58 and PB ratio of 1.41, this is probably the most undervalued stock in my portfolio. Assets over liabilities x1.43. The rest of their financials isn't that great. UTC was carrying a lot of debt, but because of the merger, it will be better balanced as RTN was only carrying $2 billion net debt. If they can decrease their debt and optimize their merger, they are set to be the new number one in defense.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nIt's still unclear how the merger will work out financially and logistically. In theory, they should be very well armed (pun intended) to take on LMT as market leader. Their exposure to commercial aircrafts is also a big threat, but it's less of an issue because they can make up with their other practices.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nAs you can see, I've tried to get the best blue chips with still some growth potential and stable growth companies together. Since a lot of companies already got mentioned on this forum, I'll include a bonus round of interesting companies I came across during my search for the best companies. I didn't include them in my portfolio mainly because I feel the chance of them succeeding and living up to their future potential is more risky than others. For you looking for higher risk, higher reward, check out these companies below.\n\n* **$INMD.** They offer minimally-invasive aesthetic medical products for various procedures, such as liposuction with simultaneous skin tightening, body and face contouring. They are actually the only company in my watchlist that scored maximum on my financial checklist. I love to watch their financials. While we're in an overvalued market, INMD has only 18.73 PE and 0.6 PEG. They certainly got hit by Covid, but I would be very surprised if they don't multiply their market share over the next years.\n* **$SMCI.** Based mainly on servers and storage solutions. They are the supplier for cloud computing and AI based companies. They were ranked 18th fastest growing company by Fortune Magazine in 2016, but they still have a long way possible to grow. I see them stagnating a bit for a few years, but they definitely have potential in the long run. Financially very stable, big on cash to make some acquisitions and trading at only 14.84 PE.\n* **$CDLX.** Great business model. They basically turn financial transaction data into valuable information for advertising. They show returns as high as 30:1 for advertising spent. Not only is the online payment industry growing fast, but after Covid companies will need to work their advertising budgets even more efficiently. CDLX has momentum and will increase that market cap massively. That future outlook has a price unfortunately and I feel they're too expensive right now.\n* **$OLED.** They hold patents on ultra high definition OLED screen technology. There's still a large transition going on from LED to OLED screens. They are estimated to increase their manufacturing with 50% by the end of 2021. Unfortunately most of that growth is already priced in right now. It doesn't take away the longer term potential, but it doesn't make it that sexy of a buy right now.\n* **$OMCL.** Omnicell provides pharmacy automation solutions and other tools for healthcare systems. Big on cash, low on debt. They have an interesting business and the automation of healthcare will continue to grow, however they are also trading a bit above value.\n* **$PCOM.** A technology company based on e-commerce and services through loyalty programs. Most of their partners are airlines, which explains their difficulties of getting back up since the drop. At the moment it's unsure how this will work out. There will barely be room for bargains or rewards, however while the industry has to build up again, there's an opportunity to take away long time customers from competitors. Although they have enough cash to weather this crisis, they are depending on the industry. At PE below 10 and having a decent cash position, it's worth a gamble.\n* **$APPS.** Digital Turbine offers a mobile platform mainly for new apps. They have a very high future revenue forecast of 202.2% over the next 3 years. Big on cash and no debt as well. They already acquired Mobile Posse in March, diversifying their platform. Analysts are putting an average price target of $9.88 on them, giving it a 61% potential return.\n* **$NVMI.** They develop and produce process control systems used in the manufacturing of semiconductors, mainly focussing on industrializing X-ray and optical technologies like holographic images. Cash to debt 6.1, debt to equity 0.1, quick ratio 5.75, ROE 12.83% and ROIC 20.26%. Their financials are great. The only thing you could say is they are slightly overvalued, but still a very nice buy in comparison to the overvalued tech industry.\n* **$INS.** Active in the fintech sector, they provide tech solutions and processing services. Very similar financials to NVMI. Big on cash, almost no long term debt, great returns (ROE 29.7% / ROIC 85.95%)  and steady growing EPS. They are also slightly overvalued, but should easily get back to $45 range after the crisis is over.\n\n\\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nSo, that's about all I have to share. This will also be my last big post a while. Analyzing stocks has been my main occupation for the last three months, but it's time to work on opening up the hotel and bar again. I hope some of you get something out of this. I'm not a professional so always check again for yourself. I'm gonna hold on to these companies for a while now. Will add some extra capital at the beginning of 2021, so you could expect another big post about my newest findings then. For now, I'm gonna take a break from following the market day in day out and enjoy the weather a bit more.\n\nHave a good one!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 667727, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm finalizing my portfolio for this year.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gt1fha/im_finalizing_my_portfolio_for_this_year/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1590783150.0}], [[], false, "TheBeardedBeast97", null, [], null, "text", "t2_23b2kh86", false, false, [], false, false, 1590019308, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gnm5i8/intc_or_amd/", {}, "gnm5i8", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "advice", [], "823be0a6-65e6-11e5-9784-125ee764bc01", "Advice", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 20, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/gnm5i8/intc_or_amd/", false, 6, 1590019314, 1, "Which one do you think is a better investment?

So intel's getting killed there as well. But in return AMD's gpu business, which despite the quality being much weaker than nvidia, still comprise 50% of the revenue, is about to be challenged by intel.\n\nAll 3 are threatend by cloud gaming as well, and perhaps cloud computing in the future. Cloud gaming will reduce PC/latop upgrade cycle even further. A 10 year old PC can run games flawlessly on Stadia and Geforce Now. Many people who otherwise would upgrade their PC now just purcahse cloud gaming subscription. cloud gaming seem to be growing extremely fast. \n\nNvidia do have the foresight so they set up GFN on their own. But it cannabilises its own GPU business.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 20th, 2020.\n\n# **A blast of earnings news is coming, but the market may be more focused on when the economy will reopen  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/a-blast-of-earnings-news-is-coming-but-the-market-may-be-more-focused-on-when-the-economy-will-reopen.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Earnings from IBM, Netflix, Coca-Cola and dozens of others are expected in the week ahead, but as the state shutdowns now reach the one-month threshold, the market is more likely to trade on virus headlines and news about reopening the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are also some important economic reports, including existing home sales on Monday and durable goods on Friday. But it is the weekly jobless claims data that will again be most relevant, as economists watch to see whether the number of workers seeking claims has now peaked and whether there are any signs some are returning to jobs, as government funds reach the hands of business owners.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks were higher, but there was a divergence with the Dow up just under 2.2% at 24,242, and Nasdaq, surging 6%, lifted by tech and biotech. The S&amp;P 500 gained 3% for the week and is now 31% off its March lows.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained amid signs the virus outbreak has peaked and some reopenings could start slowly in the next few weeks.\n*****\n&gt; The market also bounced Friday as the results of an early study of a Gilead drug showed promise with severe cases of coronavirus. Technology stocks were up about 4% for the week, and health care was up more than 5% while consumer discretionary stocks led with a gain of more than 6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs the virus news goes, so go risk assets. People expect bad economic data,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. \u201cThe data is all expected to be horrible. The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.\u201d As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back.\n*****\n&gt; Charts are important\n&gt; Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the S&amp;P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday\u2019s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&amp;P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum.\n*****\n&gt; Bob Doll, Nuveen\u2019s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there\u2019s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It\u2019s been awesome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&amp;T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. \u201cThe market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programs. \u201cWe\u2019re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. \u201cPart of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that\u2019s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,\u201d said Doll.\n*****\n&gt; Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIts going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,\u201d he said, \u201cThis one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that\u2019s defensive in nature is going to perform well.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy\u2019s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different.\n*****\n&gt; The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research.\n*****\n&gt; More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,\u201d said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey won\u2019t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,\u201d he said, \u201cI think that window will close, and we\u2019ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there\u2019s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices.\n*****\n&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002. But that contract expires Tuesday. The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a reflection of physical market conditions,\u201d said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DgwrUcm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yKRo7Ea.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3rA0fDB.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DrwoiV6.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/i40FkmH.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nMvlyBE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R8OVKd3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eZZyOqa.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dBSYk0L.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/LwQokav.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zgBClvX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Fcc6DrP.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu\n\n&gt; With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).\n\n&gt; Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&amp;P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.\n\n&gt; Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-flue.png))**\n\n&gt; So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-1920-1921.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term\n\n&gt; Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**\n\n&gt; But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&amp;P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&amp;P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Percent-GLD-SLV-SPY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It\u2019s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)\n\n&gt; It\u2019s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn\u2019t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.\n\n&gt; Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn\u2019t been great as companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won\u2019t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/calendar.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish\n\n&gt; April, the last month of DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 \u201cBest Six Months,\u201d has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA\u2019s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&amp;P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 have not fared as well, up just 2.17%.\n\n&gt; April\u2019s historical performance over the recent 21-year period is plotted in the chart above (21-year average is on the left vertical scale) compared to April 2020 (right vertical scale). Magnitude of gains this year is substantial however, the trend this year has been similar to past years. Should the current trend remain intact, further gains this month are possible. Coronavirus uncertainty remains extremely elevated, but there does to be some light flickering at the end of tunnel.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/826c536dba71629e9d1a26329db32eba/97c8d036ee5ba87c-9b/s500x750/55708144eea7c12b24adf731e9dc63e41e31604b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$PM** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$BOH** \n&gt; * **$MTB** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$BMRC** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$PHG** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$TFC** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SYF** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$LII** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$SNA** \n&gt; * **$LVS** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$KALU** \n&gt; * **$EMR** \n&gt; * **$CIT** \n&gt; * **$FITB**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zBd2gQL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/25QY7uo.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzAy7Pk.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xjSoWZ3.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RbwZ1le.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjS7QnD.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY4wQPz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/F2u6ejr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QW6sJiO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gylBF9c.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vwNztBG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $422.96\n&gt; **Netflix, Inc.

Option traders are pricing in a 9.7% move on earnings and the stock has averaged a 9.6% move in recent quarters.\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=DPZ&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 604710, "public", "self", "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 20th, 2020", 0, [], "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g3po7c/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "all_ads", 6, 1587221454.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bigbear0083", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_eaak0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1587225054, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g3po7c/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "gildings": {}, "id": "g3po7c", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "news", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "866eb162-65e6-11e5-a903-1252b640afe9", "link_flair_text": "News", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/g3po7c/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "DtzC2vZc6yQ5eQHlCueYr2rRIOyv6TqwhYURi6uNUZ0", "resolutions": [{"height": 66, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GyM-6bMH-Ip0KAa-pSjI8OoQO3bTzHrBVt5VDcmhYEM.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=171be8800b95fe5fe69f498bd7634f608155fb9d", "width": 108}, {"height": 133, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GyM-6bMH-Ip0KAa-pSjI8OoQO3bTzHrBVt5VDcmhYEM.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e060391d0e39d67ef6221a8418381e3cd3ef7051", "width": 216}, {"height": 197, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GyM-6bMH-Ip0KAa-pSjI8OoQO3bTzHrBVt5VDcmhYEM.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=510c1d3428a6d82e43f2e08c680225d6bd1892ba", "width": 320}, {"height": 394, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GyM-6bMH-Ip0KAa-pSjI8OoQO3bTzHrBVt5VDcmhYEM.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07fb50a444626ba7debe607d1bf067f057593953", "width": 640}, {"height": 591, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GyM-6bMH-Ip0KAa-pSjI8OoQO3bTzHrBVt5VDcmhYEM.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efbc9d8f4fad6580f96fd94fa7844591cdc524cc", "width": 960}, {"height": 665, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GyM-6bMH-Ip0KAa-pSjI8OoQO3bTzHrBVt5VDcmhYEM.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65447509e0236e35dada7ca5c3e55a2ba39a61cf", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 759, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GyM-6bMH-Ip0KAa-pSjI8OoQO3bTzHrBVt5VDcmhYEM.png?auto=webp&amp;s=075c1b76d9ff7a8e3fd9cad701f5bd866b070e18", "width": 1231}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1587226284, "score": 5, "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 20th, 2020.\n\n# **A blast of earnings news is coming, but the market may be more focused on when the economy will reopen  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/a-blast-of-earnings-news-is-coming-but-the-market-may-be-more-focused-on-when-the-economy-will-reopen.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Earnings from IBM, Netflix, Coca-Cola and dozens of others are expected in the week ahead, but as the state shutdowns now reach the one-month threshold, the market is more likely to trade on virus headlines and news about reopening the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are also some important economic reports, including existing home sales on Monday and durable goods on Friday. But it is the weekly jobless claims data that will again be most relevant, as economists watch to see whether the number of workers seeking claims has now peaked and whether there are any signs some are returning to jobs, as government funds reach the hands of business owners.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks were higher, but there was a divergence with the Dow up just under 2.2% at 24,242, and Nasdaq, surging 6%, lifted by tech and biotech. The S&amp;P 500 gained 3% for the week and is now 31% off its March lows.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained amid signs the virus outbreak has peaked and some reopenings could start slowly in the next few weeks.\n*****\n&gt; The market also bounced Friday as the results of an early study of a Gilead drug showed promise with severe cases of coronavirus. Technology stocks were up about 4% for the week, and health care was up more than 5% while consumer discretionary stocks led with a gain of more than 6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs the virus news goes, so go risk assets. People expect bad economic data,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. \u201cThe data is all expected to be horrible. The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.\u201d As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back.\n*****\n&gt; Charts are important\n&gt; Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the S&amp;P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday\u2019s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&amp;P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum.\n*****\n&gt; Bob Doll, Nuveen\u2019s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there\u2019s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It\u2019s been awesome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&amp;T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. \u201cThe market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programs. \u201cWe\u2019re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. \u201cPart of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that\u2019s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,\u201d said Doll.\n*****\n&gt; Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIts going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,\u201d he said, \u201cThis one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that\u2019s defensive in nature is going to perform well.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy\u2019s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different.\n*****\n&gt; The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research.\n*****\n&gt; More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,\u201d said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey won\u2019t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,\u201d he said, \u201cI think that window will close, and we\u2019ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there\u2019s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices.\n*****\n&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002. But that contract expires Tuesday. The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a reflection of physical market conditions,\u201d said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DgwrUcm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yKRo7Ea.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3rA0fDB.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DrwoiV6.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/i40FkmH.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nMvlyBE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R8OVKd3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eZZyOqa.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dBSYk0L.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/LwQokav.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zgBClvX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Fcc6DrP.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu\n\n&gt; With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).\n\n&gt; Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&amp;P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.\n\n&gt; Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-flue.png))**\n\n&gt; So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-1920-1921.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term\n\n&gt; Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**\n\n&gt; But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&amp;P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&amp;P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Percent-GLD-SLV-SPY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It\u2019s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)\n\n&gt; It\u2019s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn\u2019t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.\n\n&gt; Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn\u2019t been great as companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won\u2019t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/calendar.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish\n\n&gt; April, the last month of DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 \u201cBest Six Months,\u201d has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA\u2019s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&amp;P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%.

The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.\u201d As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back.\n*****\n&gt; Charts are important\n&gt; Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the S&amp;P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday\u2019s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&amp;P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum.\n*****\n&gt; Bob Doll, Nuveen\u2019s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there\u2019s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It\u2019s been awesome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&amp;T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. \u201cThe market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programs. \u201cWe\u2019re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. \u201cPart of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that\u2019s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,\u201d said Doll.\n*****\n&gt; Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIts going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,\u201d he said, \u201cThis one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that\u2019s defensive in nature is going to perform well.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy\u2019s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different.\n*****\n&gt; The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research.\n*****\n&gt; More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,\u201d said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey won\u2019t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,\u201d he said, \u201cI think that window will close, and we\u2019ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there\u2019s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices.\n*****\n&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002. But that contract expires Tuesday. The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a reflection of physical market conditions,\u201d said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DgwrUcm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yKRo7Ea.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3rA0fDB.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DrwoiV6.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/i40FkmH.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nMvlyBE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R8OVKd3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eZZyOqa.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dBSYk0L.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/LwQokav.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zgBClvX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Fcc6DrP.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu\n\n&gt; With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).\n\n&gt; Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&amp;P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.\n\n&gt; Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-flue.png))**\n\n&gt; So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-1920-1921.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term\n\n&gt; Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**\n\n&gt; But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&amp;P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&amp;P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Percent-GLD-SLV-SPY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It\u2019s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)\n\n&gt; It\u2019s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn\u2019t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.\n\n&gt; Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn\u2019t been great as companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won\u2019t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/calendar.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish\n\n&gt; April, the last month of DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 \u201cBest Six Months,\u201d has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA\u2019s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&amp;P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 have not fared as well, up just 2.17%.\n\n&gt; April\u2019s historical performance over the recent 21-year period is plotted in the chart above (21-year average is on the left vertical scale) compared to April 2020 (right vertical scale). Magnitude of gains this year is substantial however, the trend this year has been similar to past years. Should the current trend remain intact, further gains this month are possible. Coronavirus uncertainty remains extremely elevated, but there does to be some light flickering at the end of tunnel.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/826c536dba71629e9d1a26329db32eba/97c8d036ee5ba87c-9b/s500x750/55708144eea7c12b24adf731e9dc63e41e31604b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$PM** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$BOH** \n&gt; * **$MTB** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$BMRC** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$PHG** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$TFC** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SYF** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$LII** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$SNA** \n&gt; * **$LVS** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$KALU** \n&gt; * **$EMR** \n&gt; * **$CIT** \n&gt; * **$FITB**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zBd2gQL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/25QY7uo.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzAy7Pk.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xjSoWZ3.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RbwZ1le.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjS7QnD.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY4wQPz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/F2u6ejr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QW6sJiO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gylBF9c.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vwNztBG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $422.96\n&gt; **Netflix, Inc.

But it is the weekly jobless claims data that will again be most relevant, as economists watch to see whether the number of workers seeking claims has now peaked and whether there are any signs some are returning to jobs, as government funds reach the hands of business owners.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks were higher, but there was a divergence with the Dow up just under 2.2% at 24,242, and Nasdaq, surging 6%, lifted by tech and biotech. The S&amp;P 500 gained 3% for the week and is now 31% off its March lows.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained amid signs the virus outbreak has peaked and some reopenings could start slowly in the next few weeks.\n*****\n&gt; The market also bounced Friday as the results of an early study of a Gilead drug showed promise with severe cases of coronavirus. Technology stocks were up about 4% for the week, and health care was up more than 5% while consumer discretionary stocks led with a gain of more than 6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs the virus news goes, so go risk assets. People expect bad economic data,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. \u201cThe data is all expected to be horrible. The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.\u201d As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back.\n*****\n&gt; Charts are important\n&gt; Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the S&amp;P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday\u2019s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&amp;P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum.\n*****\n&gt; Bob Doll, Nuveen\u2019s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there\u2019s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It\u2019s been awesome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&amp;T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. \u201cThe market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programs. \u201cWe\u2019re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. \u201cPart of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that\u2019s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,\u201d said Doll.\n*****\n&gt; Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIts going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,\u201d he said, \u201cThis one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that\u2019s defensive in nature is going to perform well.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy\u2019s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different.\n*****\n&gt; The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research.\n*****\n&gt; More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,\u201d said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey won\u2019t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,\u201d he said, \u201cI think that window will close, and we\u2019ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there\u2019s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices.\n*****\n&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002. But that contract expires Tuesday. The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a reflection of physical market conditions,\u201d said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DgwrUcm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yKRo7Ea.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3rA0fDB.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DrwoiV6.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/i40FkmH.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nMvlyBE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R8OVKd3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eZZyOqa.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dBSYk0L.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/LwQokav.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zgBClvX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Fcc6DrP.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu\n\n&gt; With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).\n\n&gt; Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&amp;P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.\n\n&gt; Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-flue.png))**\n\n&gt; So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-1920-1921.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term\n\n&gt; Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**\n\n&gt; But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&amp;P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&amp;P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Percent-GLD-SLV-SPY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It\u2019s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)\n\n&gt; It\u2019s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn\u2019t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.\n\n&gt; Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn\u2019t been great as companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won\u2019t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/calendar.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish\n\n&gt; April, the last month of DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 \u201cBest Six Months,\u201d has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA\u2019s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&amp;P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 have not fared as well, up just 2.17%.\n\n&gt; April\u2019s historical performance over the recent 21-year period is plotted in the chart above (21-year average is on the left vertical scale) compared to April 2020 (right vertical scale). Magnitude of gains this year is substantial however, the trend this year has been similar to past years. Should the current trend remain intact, further gains this month are possible. Coronavirus uncertainty remains extremely elevated, but there does to be some light flickering at the end of tunnel.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/826c536dba71629e9d1a26329db32eba/97c8d036ee5ba87c-9b/s500x750/55708144eea7c12b24adf731e9dc63e41e31604b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$PM** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$BOH** \n&gt; * **$MTB** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$BMRC** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$PHG** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$TFC** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SYF** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$LII** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$SNA** \n&gt; * **$LVS** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$KALU** \n&gt; * **$EMR** \n&gt; * **$CIT** \n&gt; * **$FITB**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zBd2gQL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/25QY7uo.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzAy7Pk.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xjSoWZ3.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RbwZ1le.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjS7QnD.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY4wQPz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/F2u6ejr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QW6sJiO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gylBF9c.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vwNztBG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $422.96\n&gt; **Netflix, Inc.

Option traders are pricing in a 9.7% move on earnings and the stock has averaged a 9.6% move in recent quarters.\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=DPZ&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 604600, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 20th, 2020", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g3okfm/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1587217323.0}], [[], false, "bigbear0083", null, [], null, "text", "t2_eaak0", false, true, [], false, false, 1587220434, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g3og0i/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", {}, "g3og0i", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "news", [], "866eb162-65e6-11e5-a903-1252b640afe9", "News", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 0, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/g3og0i/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", false, "self", {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "DtzC2vZc6yQ5eQHlCueYr2rRIOyv6TqwhYURi6uNUZ0", "resolutions": [{"height": 66, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GyM-6bMH-Ip0KAa-pSjI8OoQO3bTzHrBVt5VDcmhYEM.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=171be8800b95fe5fe69f498bd7634f608155fb9d", "width": 108}, {"height": 133, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GyM-6bMH-Ip0KAa-pSjI8OoQO3bTzHrBVt5VDcmhYEM.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e060391d0e39d67ef6221a8418381e3cd3ef7051", "width": 216}, {"height": 197, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GyM-6bMH-Ip0KAa-pSjI8OoQO3bTzHrBVt5VDcmhYEM.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=510c1d3428a6d82e43f2e08c680225d6bd1892ba", "width": 320}, {"height": 394, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GyM-6bMH-Ip0KAa-pSjI8OoQO3bTzHrBVt5VDcmhYEM.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07fb50a444626ba7debe607d1bf067f057593953", "width": 640}, {"height": 591, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GyM-6bMH-Ip0KAa-pSjI8OoQO3bTzHrBVt5VDcmhYEM.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efbc9d8f4fad6580f96fd94fa7844591cdc524cc", "width": 960}, {"height": 665, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GyM-6bMH-Ip0KAa-pSjI8OoQO3bTzHrBVt5VDcmhYEM.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65447509e0236e35dada7ca5c3e55a2ba39a61cf", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 759, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GyM-6bMH-Ip0KAa-pSjI8OoQO3bTzHrBVt5VDcmhYEM.png?auto=webp&amp;s=075c1b76d9ff7a8e3fd9cad701f5bd866b070e18", "width": 1231}, "variants": {}}]}, 6, 1587220436, 1, "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks.

But it is the weekly jobless claims data that will again be most relevant, as economists watch to see whether the number of workers seeking claims has now peaked and whether there are any signs some are returning to jobs, as government funds reach the hands of business owners.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks were higher, but there was a divergence with the Dow up just under 2.2% at 24,242, and Nasdaq, surging 6%, lifted by tech and biotech. The S&amp;P 500 gained 3% for the week and is now 31% off its March lows.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained amid signs the virus outbreak has peaked and some reopenings could start slowly in the next few weeks.\n*****\n&gt; The market also bounced Friday as the results of an early study of a Gilead drug showed promise with severe cases of coronavirus. Technology stocks were up about 4% for the week, and health care was up more than 5% while consumer discretionary stocks led with a gain of more than 6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs the virus news goes, so go risk assets. People expect bad economic data,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. \u201cThe data is all expected to be horrible. The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.\u201d As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back.\n*****\n&gt; Charts are important\n&gt; Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the S&amp;P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday\u2019s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&amp;P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum.\n*****\n&gt; Bob Doll, Nuveen\u2019s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there\u2019s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It\u2019s been awesome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&amp;T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. \u201cThe market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programs. \u201cWe\u2019re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. \u201cPart of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that\u2019s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,\u201d said Doll.\n*****\n&gt; Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIts going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,\u201d he said, \u201cThis one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that\u2019s defensive in nature is going to perform well.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy\u2019s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different.\n*****\n&gt; The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research.\n*****\n&gt; More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,\u201d said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey won\u2019t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,\u201d he said, \u201cI think that window will close, and we\u2019ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there\u2019s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices.\n*****\n&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002. But that contract expires Tuesday. The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a reflection of physical market conditions,\u201d said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DgwrUcm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yKRo7Ea.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3rA0fDB.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DrwoiV6.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/i40FkmH.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nMvlyBE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R8OVKd3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eZZyOqa.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dBSYk0L.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/LwQokav.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zgBClvX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Fcc6DrP.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu\n\n&gt; With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).\n\n&gt; Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&amp;P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.\n\n&gt; Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-flue.png))**\n\n&gt; So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-1920-1921.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term\n\n&gt; Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**\n\n&gt; But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&amp;P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&amp;P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Percent-GLD-SLV-SPY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It\u2019s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)\n\n&gt; It\u2019s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn\u2019t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.\n\n&gt; Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn\u2019t been great as companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won\u2019t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/calendar.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish\n\n&gt; April, the last month of DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 \u201cBest Six Months,\u201d has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA\u2019s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&amp;P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%.

The S&amp;P 500 gained 3% for the week and is now 31% off its March lows.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained amid signs the virus outbreak has peaked and some reopenings could start slowly in the next few weeks.\n*****\n&gt; The market also bounced Friday as the results of an early study of a Gilead drug showed promise with severe cases of coronavirus. Technology stocks were up about 4% for the week, and health care was up more than 5% while consumer discretionary stocks led with a gain of more than 6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs the virus news goes, so go risk assets. People expect bad economic data,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. \u201cThe data is all expected to be horrible. The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.\u201d As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back.\n*****\n&gt; Charts are important\n&gt; Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the S&amp;P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday\u2019s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&amp;P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum.\n*****\n&gt; Bob Doll, Nuveen\u2019s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there\u2019s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It\u2019s been awesome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&amp;T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. \u201cThe market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programs. \u201cWe\u2019re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. \u201cPart of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that\u2019s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,\u201d said Doll.\n*****\n&gt; Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIts going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,\u201d he said, \u201cThis one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that\u2019s defensive in nature is going to perform well.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy\u2019s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different.\n*****\n&gt; The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research.\n*****\n&gt; More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,\u201d said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey won\u2019t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,\u201d he said, \u201cI think that window will close, and we\u2019ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there\u2019s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices.\n*****\n&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002. But that contract expires Tuesday. The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a reflection of physical market conditions,\u201d said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DgwrUcm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yKRo7Ea.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3rA0fDB.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DrwoiV6.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/i40FkmH.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nMvlyBE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R8OVKd3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eZZyOqa.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dBSYk0L.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/LwQokav.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zgBClvX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Fcc6DrP.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu\n\n&gt; With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).\n\n&gt; Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&amp;P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.\n\n&gt; Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-flue.png))**\n\n&gt; So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-1920-1921.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term\n\n&gt; Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**\n\n&gt; But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&amp;P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&amp;P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Percent-GLD-SLV-SPY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It\u2019s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)\n\n&gt; It\u2019s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn\u2019t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.\n\n&gt; Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn\u2019t been great as companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won\u2019t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/calendar.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish\n\n&gt; April, the last month of DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 \u201cBest Six Months,\u201d has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA\u2019s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&amp;P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 have not fared as well, up just 2.17%.\n\n&gt; April\u2019s historical performance over the recent 21-year period is plotted in the chart above (21-year average is on the left vertical scale) compared to April 2020 (right vertical scale). Magnitude of gains this year is substantial however, the trend this year has been similar to past years. Should the current trend remain intact, further gains this month are possible. Coronavirus uncertainty remains extremely elevated, but there does to be some light flickering at the end of tunnel.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/826c536dba71629e9d1a26329db32eba/97c8d036ee5ba87c-9b/s500x750/55708144eea7c12b24adf731e9dc63e41e31604b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$PM** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$BOH** \n&gt; * **$MTB** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$BMRC** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$PHG** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$TFC** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SYF** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$LII** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$SNA** \n&gt; * **$LVS** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$KALU** \n&gt; * **$EMR** \n&gt; * **$CIT** \n&gt; * **$FITB**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zBd2gQL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/25QY7uo.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzAy7Pk.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xjSoWZ3.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RbwZ1le.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjS7QnD.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY4wQPz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/F2u6ejr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QW6sJiO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gylBF9c.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vwNztBG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $422.96\n&gt; **Netflix, Inc.

Regardless of whether or not they still have their Financial Analyst day on 05 March 2020 they are still primed to take off.  Almost all of the recent processors they have released have resulted in backorders and lines at retailers for people to buy the products, sometimes well over MSRP.  There is evidence to suggest $AAPL is looking at using their processors in the near to medium term future as well.  This of course would make the company pop.  After reaching a high of $59.27 I picked these up on Coronavirus fears at $46.40, around 21% discount from their recent high.\n\n$MSFT has been through the ringer lately.  With $AMZN whining about the JEDI contract, to Coronavirus fears this thing has just been pummeled.  With a recent high of $190.70 and picking these up at $165.39 these are at about 13.27% discount.  I suspect they will be allowed to continue with their JEDI contract because attempting implicate federal employees in any wrongdoing is seriously difficult due to the \"Discretionary\" nature of awarding contracts.\n\n$TAN is Invesco's Solar Energy ETF.  With the world looking to renewables and green energy this is a no brainer.\n\n$PBD is Invesco's Global Clean Energy ETF.

Regardless of whether or not they still have their Financial Analyst day on 05 March 2020 they are still primed to take off.  Almost all of the recent processors they have released have resulted in backorders and lines at retailers for people to buy the products, sometimes well over MSRP.  There is evidence to suggest $AAPL is looking at using their processors in the near to medium term future as well.  This of course would make the company pop.  After reaching a high of $59.27 I picked these up on Coronavirus fears at $46.40, around 21% discount from their recent high.\n\n$MSFT has been through the ringer lately.  With $AMZN whining about the JEDI contract, to Coronavirus fears this thing has just been pummeled.  With a recent high of $190.70 and picking these up at $165.39 these are at about 13.27% discount.  I suspect they will be allowed to continue with their JEDI contract because attempting implicate federal employees in any wrongdoing is seriously difficult due to the \"Discretionary\" nature of awarding contracts.\n\n$TAN is Invesco's Solar Energy ETF.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt;

With the China trade deal signed this past Wednesday, strategists say they are now watching for any signs of a bigger trade row brewing between the U.S. and Europe.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports, including existing home sales Wednesday; leading indicators Thursday, and the Markit PMI data for manufacturing and services on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; But it\u2019s earnings, where investors will take the pulse of corporate America, and decide whether forward guidance is justifying the stock market\u2019s record highs and price earnings ratio of more than 18.5. The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 2% in the past week, its best week since August. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,329 Friday and is now up about 3% since the start of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow and Nasdaq also ended the week at new highs. The Dow ended up 1.9% for the week, at 29,348. The Nasdaq rose 2.3% in the past week, ending at 9,388.\n*****\n&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse, said the fourth quarter could be a turning point for earnings, after a poor performance in 2019. So far, earnings are down about 0.8% this quarter, based on actual releases and estimates, according to Refinitiv. If not for the drag from energy companies, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies would have been 1.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201c2019 was a year of lousy earnings, and the fourth quarter is the end of a lousy year,\u201d said Golub. \u201cI think earnings surprises will be fine, but what the real story here is, it looks like magically the 2020 numbers are going to be much, much stronger than 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said there are two big themes this earnings season. \u201cThe first one is tech-related companies. Many of the mega caps had okay earnings, but their margins were under a lot of pressure and it subtracted earnings growth in 2019. Those trends are supposed to reverse. So what was a negative because of easy comps becomes a positive,\u201d Golub said. \u201cThe same thing with the energy sector which was a disaster in terms of earnings growth in 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market rally can continue in part because investors are not yet on board with the earnings story.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile everybody is looking at the fourth quarter, I think they\u2019re not really reading the right script, and the script they should be reading was this was the last quarter where tech margins and energy sector headwinds are overwhelming the market,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The hearings on Trump\u2019s impeachment are so far ignored by markets and will be underway in the Senate. While the market continues to shrug it off, traders are monitoring the situation for any change in tone.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWill there be new evidence/witnesses at the Senate trial to make it politically significant?,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Alan Ruskin. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that for many voters, the President seems to be the main motivator for voters on both sides of the political spectrum \u2014 for and against. This argument runs along the lines that Trump is running against himself/\u2018the anti-Trump\u2019, and, the election will be heavily impacted by which Democrat candidate least impacts the \u2018anti-Trump\u2019 vote \u2014 a view that some argue tends to support centrists like Biden.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7YCrtpo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9jQCYRG.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXureFC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/3upRv6z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O07l30Z.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BjiCdpH.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/w5fgr9y.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/L81ewyy.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vroSSfA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MMO35Qf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/dCxJl8u.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading Mixed since 1998, But Improving Lately\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 22 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.79% by DJIA to 0.14% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last eight years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef3ff1e52532ea69e189a7cd90e7b27/bf3ce263396269e9-14/s500x750/4fc5ea153df07c1e2ab94f583409f214f2eae3c6.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Closer Look At Election Years\n\n&gt; 2020 is off to a roaring start, picking up right where 2019 left off. Many investors are eyeing the upcoming presidential election as an impending storm for the stock market. In the four-year presidential cycle, pre-election years have tended to be the strongest for stocks, as sitting presidents have taken measures to boost the economy and stock market higher to garner votes. It sure worked out well last year, with the S&amp;P 500 Index\u2019s 31% total return.\n\n&gt; Returns in election years, however, have been quite bifurcated.\n\n&gt; \u201cIf an incumbent president was up for reelection, stocks tended to do extremely well,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOn the other hand, if there was a lame duck president in office, returns were quite muted.\u201d\n\n&gt; Note that a \u201clame duck president\u201d means the sitting president either isn\u2019t running for reelection or has already fulfilled the maximum two terms. It makes sense, as the president could be less motivated to do things to heat up the economy if they know they are leaving office. Possibly, investors may also get cold feet knowing a change is coming. The S&amp;P 500 was down in 2000 and 2008, and the sitting president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d both years.\n\n&gt; In the LPL Chart of the Day, we break down election years by whether the president was running for reelection or a lame duck. The chart shows the S&amp;P 500 up an impressive 11.7% on average if the President was running for reelection, compared to up an average of 2.4% if president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d.\n\n&gt; Given most presidents who have run a second time have tended to win, this could be the market\u2019s way of saying it is comfortable with the status quo over change.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another encouraging historical trend is that the S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t been lower during an election year with an incumbent president up for reelection since 1940. To be clear, stocks have been up during election years when the incumbent president actually lost. In 1980, the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 26%, but Jimmy Carter still lost to Ronald Reagan. In other words, this does support the notion of higher stocks in 2020, but higher stocks can\u2019t always tell you who will win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Q4 Earnings Season is All About 2020\n\n&gt; Fourth quarter earnings season kicked off this week with 24 S&amp;P 500 Index companies slated to report results. Our expectations are for a marginal increase in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis, based on current FactSet consensus estimates (-2% year over year) and the average historical upside of roughly 3 percentage points.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve become accustomed to meager earnings growth. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if fourth quarter results are anywhere near expectations, 2019 will end up as a year with S&amp;P 500 returns of more than 30% and no corporate earnings growth to speak of. That means expanding stock valuations drove the market\u2019s gains last year, a trend we do not expect to continue.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Earnings-blog-011520-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWe expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWith valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Accordingly, the key to this reporting season will be whether the optimistic growth outlook reflected in consensus earnings estimates for this year remains intact after companies issue guidance. Many companies will be commenting on 2020 for the first time. Our estimate of $175 per share in S&amp;P 500 EPS for the entire year represents a 6\u20137% increase from our $165 forecast for 2019. Based on the latest consensus estimates, that growth rate may get pushed up a bit. We still think $175 is attainable if capital investment picks up after stalling last year and wage growth remains stable.\n\n&gt; Trade progress may help. The United States and China will sign the phase-one trade deal later today. While negotiations on the next phase will be tougher and could even stall out, businesses would welcome the additional clarity that de-escalation can provide, something that clearly weighed on corporate profits last year.\n\n*****\n\n# January Off To Stronger Than Usual Start \u2013 But 2nd Half Is Weaker\n\n&gt; Stocks are off to a stronger that usual so far in January 2020 when compared in the chart above to the average performance over the most recent 21-year period. As of today\u2019s close DJIA is up 1.41%, S&amp;P 500 +1.61%, NASDAQ leads the pack +3.11% and the Russell 2000 was in the red until the past two days and is now up 0.44%. This is well above historical average performance in recent Januarys.\n\n&gt; The market was up nicely today until reports hit the newswires at about 1:30 pm ET creating uncertainty that the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed tomorrow between the US and China may be pabulum. The realization that the tariffs on Chinese goods may remain in place until after the election as the review process runs its course drove stocks lower this afternoon. The market gave back most of its early gains with only the Dow and Russell 2000 eking out gains today.\n\n&gt; However, as you can see in the dotted lines so far in 2020 the indices are tracking the last 21-years rather closely. If the pattern continues to pan out this year, look for a little strength over the next two days. Then weakness has been prone to appear just after mid-month after the eleventh trading day with mild average losses from on or around the eleventh trading day to the fourteenth trading day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2f102c5c61bd803b4bc407e8c4812e3/1b34c8a8e7ad3e39-e9/s500x750/829ff7ea82b52109b737d17e4b24cb0a4d28e434.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Jackpot for Stocks\n\n&gt; Solid across the board gains this year have put another January Trifecta Jackpot in our sights for 2020. So far our January Trifecta is two for two. Our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system came in positive up 0.7% on January 8 following up on a positive reading for our Santa Claus Rally (SCR) on January 3. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month\u2019s end.\n\n&gt; We just published an update on The Incredible January Barometer: Only 11 Major Errors in 82 Years that runs through the reasons behind the efficacy of the January. We discuss how the passage of the Twentieth \u201cLame Duck\u201d Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 created the January Barometer. We also compare the January Barometer results along with the full year results, the following eleven months results, and the subsequent twelve months results to all other \u201cMonthly Barometers\u201d using the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite\n\n&gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table below). In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing \u201cLast 11 Mon\u201d years, in the table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 \u201319.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.\n\n&gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain decent. Of the last 10 times since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.\n\n&gt; A positive SCR and FFD are encouraging and further clarity will be gained when the January Barometer (page 16, 2020 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac) reports at month\u2019s end. A positive January Barometer would certainly boost prospects for full-year 2020. The December Low Indicator (2020 STA, page 34) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow\u2019s December Closing Low of 27502.81 on 12/3/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1bcaf64028a60761e27f90b96cd50a5/be57098a98452149-c8/s500x750/8bde32d516bf2811adabb784ab6de926796ad504.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equities Closing In On A Breakout\n\n&gt; Below is a chart of the Bloomberg World Equity Market index, which is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 publicly listed companies around the world (including the US). While the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 15% from its January 2018 high, it's notable that we still haven't seen equities break out on a global scale. As shown, the Bloomberg World Index is now just a hair below its prior all-time highs (22 basis points to be exact).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-BBG-World.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-SP-5-years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Three Months And Counting Since Last 1% Decline\n\n&gt; It has now been over three months since the S&amp;P 500's last decline of 1% or more back on 10/9. While it seems like an eternity, the current streak of 67 trading days is nowhere near any sort of record on either a long or short-term basis. The chart below shows historical streaks without a decline of 1%+ for the S&amp;P 500 dating back to 1928. The record for the longest streak was back in 1963 when the S&amp;P 500 went 174 trading days - a full eight months - without a 1% drop. Even more impressive is the fact that in both the 1950s and 1960s there were numerous streaks of 100 or more days. For a decade that is looked back on as one with a lot of upheaval in the US, the 1960s was a period of relative calm for the equity market.\n\n&gt; More recently, the current streak of 67 trading days doesn't look all that impressive relative to streaks we saw back in 2017 and 2018. Right after the election in 2016 and into March of 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had a 109-day streak without a 1% decline, and then from late 2017 through January 2018, there was another streak of 112 trading days without a 1% drop. Even in October 2018, there was another streak of 74 trading days. In other words, in just the last three years there have been three longer streaks without a 1% decline than the current one. In the S&amp;P 500's history, there have been 26 other streaks that have been as long or longer than the current one, and half of those went on to last at least 100 trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011420-Streaks-Without-a-1-Percent-Decline.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 17th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$TAL** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$TEAM** \n&gt; * **$KMI** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SWKS** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$MBWM** \n&gt; * **$TXN** \n&gt; * **$COF** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$UNP** \n&gt; * **$AMTD** \n&gt; * **$FNB** \n&gt; * **$SBNY** \n&gt; * **$RCI** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$STM** \n&gt; * **$AUB** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$BKR** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$NAVI** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$APH** \n&gt; * **$NTRS** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$TER** \n&gt; * **$ZION**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/cCUTW9b.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/HZqsu6j.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

Just a few dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report in the four-day trading week, including IBM Tuesday and Intel on Thursday. Johnson &amp; Johnson reports Wednesday; Procter &amp; Gamble is Thursday, and American Express releases results Friday. The stock market is closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump travels to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum, where he speaks Tuesday. With the China trade deal signed this past Wednesday, strategists say they are now watching for any signs of a bigger trade row brewing between the U.S. and Europe.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports, including existing home sales Wednesday; leading indicators Thursday, and the Markit PMI data for manufacturing and services on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; But it\u2019s earnings, where investors will take the pulse of corporate America, and decide whether forward guidance is justifying the stock market\u2019s record highs and price earnings ratio of more than 18.5. The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 2% in the past week, its best week since August. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,329 Friday and is now up about 3% since the start of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow and Nasdaq also ended the week at new highs. The Dow ended up 1.9% for the week, at 29,348. The Nasdaq rose 2.3% in the past week, ending at 9,388.\n*****\n&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse, said the fourth quarter could be a turning point for earnings, after a poor performance in 2019. So far, earnings are down about 0.8% this quarter, based on actual releases and estimates, according to Refinitiv. If not for the drag from energy companies, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies would have been 1.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201c2019 was a year of lousy earnings, and the fourth quarter is the end of a lousy year,\u201d said Golub. \u201cI think earnings surprises will be fine, but what the real story here is, it looks like magically the 2020 numbers are going to be much, much stronger than 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said there are two big themes this earnings season. \u201cThe first one is tech-related companies. Many of the mega caps had okay earnings, but their margins were under a lot of pressure and it subtracted earnings growth in 2019. Those trends are supposed to reverse. So what was a negative because of easy comps becomes a positive,\u201d Golub said. \u201cThe same thing with the energy sector which was a disaster in terms of earnings growth in 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market rally can continue in part because investors are not yet on board with the earnings story.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile everybody is looking at the fourth quarter, I think they\u2019re not really reading the right script, and the script they should be reading was this was the last quarter where tech margins and energy sector headwinds are overwhelming the market,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The hearings on Trump\u2019s impeachment are so far ignored by markets and will be underway in the Senate. While the market continues to shrug it off, traders are monitoring the situation for any change in tone.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWill there be new evidence/witnesses at the Senate trial to make it politically significant?,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Alan Ruskin. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that for many voters, the President seems to be the main motivator for voters on both sides of the political spectrum \u2014 for and against. This argument runs along the lines that Trump is running against himself/\u2018the anti-Trump\u2019, and, the election will be heavily impacted by which Democrat candidate least impacts the \u2018anti-Trump\u2019 vote \u2014 a view that some argue tends to support centrists like Biden.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7YCrtpo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9jQCYRG.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXureFC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/3upRv6z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O07l30Z.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BjiCdpH.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/w5fgr9y.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/L81ewyy.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vroSSfA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MMO35Qf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/dCxJl8u.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading Mixed since 1998, But Improving Lately\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986.

It sure worked out well last year, with the S&amp;P 500 Index\u2019s 31% total return.\n\n&gt; Returns in election years, however, have been quite bifurcated.\n\n&gt; \u201cIf an incumbent president was up for reelection, stocks tended to do extremely well,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOn the other hand, if there was a lame duck president in office, returns were quite muted.\u201d\n\n&gt; Note that a \u201clame duck president\u201d means the sitting president either isn\u2019t running for reelection or has already fulfilled the maximum two terms. It makes sense, as the president could be less motivated to do things to heat up the economy if they know they are leaving office. Possibly, investors may also get cold feet knowing a change is coming. The S&amp;P 500 was down in 2000 and 2008, and the sitting president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d both years.\n\n&gt; In the LPL Chart of the Day, we break down election years by whether the president was running for reelection or a lame duck. The chart shows the S&amp;P 500 up an impressive 11.7% on average if the President was running for reelection, compared to up an average of 2.4% if president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d.\n\n&gt; Given most presidents who have run a second time have tended to win, this could be the market\u2019s way of saying it is comfortable with the status quo over change.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another encouraging historical trend is that the S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t been lower during an election year with an incumbent president up for reelection since 1940. To be clear, stocks have been up during election years when the incumbent president actually lost. In 1980, the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 26%, but Jimmy Carter still lost to Ronald Reagan. In other words, this does support the notion of higher stocks in 2020, but higher stocks can\u2019t always tell you who will win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Q4 Earnings Season is All About 2020\n\n&gt; Fourth quarter earnings season kicked off this week with 24 S&amp;P 500 Index companies slated to report results. Our expectations are for a marginal increase in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis, based on current FactSet consensus estimates (-2% year over year) and the average historical upside of roughly 3 percentage points.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve become accustomed to meager earnings growth. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if fourth quarter results are anywhere near expectations, 2019 will end up as a year with S&amp;P 500 returns of more than 30% and no corporate earnings growth to speak of. That means expanding stock valuations drove the market\u2019s gains last year, a trend we do not expect to continue.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Earnings-blog-011520-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWe expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWith valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Accordingly, the key to this reporting season will be whether the optimistic growth outlook reflected in consensus earnings estimates for this year remains intact after companies issue guidance. Many companies will be commenting on 2020 for the first time. Our estimate of $175 per share in S&amp;P 500 EPS for the entire year represents a 6\u20137% increase from our $165 forecast for 2019. Based on the latest consensus estimates, that growth rate may get pushed up a bit. We still think $175 is attainable if capital investment picks up after stalling last year and wage growth remains stable.\n\n&gt; Trade progress may help. The United States and China will sign the phase-one trade deal later today. While negotiations on the next phase will be tougher and could even stall out, businesses would welcome the additional clarity that de-escalation can provide, something that clearly weighed on corporate profits last year.\n\n*****\n\n# January Off To Stronger Than Usual Start \u2013 But 2nd Half Is Weaker\n\n&gt; Stocks are off to a stronger that usual so far in January 2020 when compared in the chart above to the average performance over the most recent 21-year period. As of today\u2019s close DJIA is up 1.41%, S&amp;P 500 +1.61%, NASDAQ leads the pack +3.11% and the Russell 2000 was in the red until the past two days and is now up 0.44%. This is well above historical average performance in recent Januarys.\n\n&gt; The market was up nicely today until reports hit the newswires at about 1:30 pm ET creating uncertainty that the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed tomorrow between the US and China may be pabulum. The realization that the tariffs on Chinese goods may remain in place until after the election as the review process runs its course drove stocks lower this afternoon. The market gave back most of its early gains with only the Dow and Russell 2000 eking out gains today.\n\n&gt; However, as you can see in the dotted lines so far in 2020 the indices are tracking the last 21-years rather closely. If the pattern continues to pan out this year, look for a little strength over the next two days. Then weakness has been prone to appear just after mid-month after the eleventh trading day with mild average losses from on or around the eleventh trading day to the fourteenth trading day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2f102c5c61bd803b4bc407e8c4812e3/1b34c8a8e7ad3e39-e9/s500x750/829ff7ea82b52109b737d17e4b24cb0a4d28e434.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Jackpot for Stocks\n\n&gt; Solid across the board gains this year have put another January Trifecta Jackpot in our sights for 2020. So far our January Trifecta is two for two. Our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system came in positive up 0.7% on January 8 following up on a positive reading for our Santa Claus Rally (SCR) on January 3. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month\u2019s end.\n\n&gt; We just published an update on The Incredible January Barometer: Only 11 Major Errors in 82 Years that runs through the reasons behind the efficacy of the January. We discuss how the passage of the Twentieth \u201cLame Duck\u201d Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 created the January Barometer. We also compare the January Barometer results along with the full year results, the following eleven months results, and the subsequent twelve months results to all other \u201cMonthly Barometers\u201d using the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite\n\n&gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table below). In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing \u201cLast 11 Mon\u201d years, in the table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 \u201319.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.\n\n&gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain decent. Of the last 10 times since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.\n\n&gt; A positive SCR and FFD are encouraging and further clarity will be gained when the January Barometer (page 16, 2020 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac) reports at month\u2019s end. A positive January Barometer would certainly boost prospects for full-year 2020. The December Low Indicator (2020 STA, page 34) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow\u2019s December Closing Low of 27502.81 on 12/3/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1bcaf64028a60761e27f90b96cd50a5/be57098a98452149-c8/s500x750/8bde32d516bf2811adabb784ab6de926796ad504.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equities Closing In On A Breakout\n\n&gt; Below is a chart of the Bloomberg World Equity Market index, which is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 publicly listed companies around the world (including the US). While the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 15% from its January 2018 high, it's notable that we still haven't seen equities break out on a global scale. As shown, the Bloomberg World Index is now just a hair below its prior all-time highs (22 basis points to be exact).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-BBG-World.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-SP-5-years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Three Months And Counting Since Last 1% Decline\n\n&gt; It has now been over three months since the S&amp;P 500's last decline of 1% or more back on 10/9. While it seems like an eternity, the current streak of 67 trading days is nowhere near any sort of record on either a long or short-term basis. The chart below shows historical streaks without a decline of 1%+ for the S&amp;P 500 dating back to 1928. The record for the longest streak was back in 1963 when the S&amp;P 500 went 174 trading days - a full eight months - without a 1% drop. Even more impressive is the fact that in both the 1950s and 1960s there were numerous streaks of 100 or more days. For a decade that is looked back on as one with a lot of upheaval in the US, the 1960s was a period of relative calm for the equity market.\n\n&gt; More recently, the current streak of 67 trading days doesn't look all that impressive relative to streaks we saw back in 2017 and 2018. Right after the election in 2016 and into March of 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had a 109-day streak without a 1% decline, and then from late 2017 through January 2018, there was another streak of 112 trading days without a 1% drop. Even in October 2018, there was another streak of 74 trading days. In other words, in just the last three years there have been three longer streaks without a 1% decline than the current one. In the S&amp;P 500's history, there have been 26 other streaks that have been as long or longer than the current one, and half of those went on to last at least 100 trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011420-Streaks-Without-a-1-Percent-Decline.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 17th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$TAL** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$TEAM** \n&gt; * **$KMI** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SWKS** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$MBWM** \n&gt; * **$TXN** \n&gt; * **$COF** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$UNP** \n&gt; * **$AMTD** \n&gt; * **$FNB** \n&gt; * **$SBNY** \n&gt; * **$RCI** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$STM** \n&gt; * **$AUB** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$BKR** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$NAVI** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$APH** \n&gt; * **$NTRS** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$TER** \n&gt; * **$ZION**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/cCUTW9b.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/HZqsu6j.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.
