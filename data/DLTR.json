They have been undergoing the greatest COVID-19 comeback story that you never heard of, growing sales 31% QoQ and earnings per share 61% but lets focus on the basics.\n\nFirst let's look at the basic Metrics and Ratios compared to their competitors and you:\n\n|Share Price|**$52.60**|\n|:-|:-|\n|Market Cap| **2.05B** |\n|Sales(12 months)| **5.86B** |\n|Income(12 months)| **722.00M** |\n|Price/Earnings(P/E)| **2.88** |\n|Price/Sales(P/S)| **0.35**|\n|Profit Margin| **12.30%**|\n\nNo that's not a typo!

Big Lots was late to the ecommerce game and only started focusing on ecommerce and updating their fulfillment centers last year 2019 which is a big part of why they've performed so poorly in the last few years.

Thanksgiving traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season, an important time of the year for the economy which could be hobbled by Covid. The U.S. reported 182,000 new cases Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Lee said the market will continue to feel the push pull of the drag from the pandemic against the promise of recovery, seen in the rebound of cyclical stocks. Cyclical sectors industrials and materials were both up about 1% for the week, and financials were up a half percent. But tech and communications, both big tech and growth sectors that benefited from the stay-at-home trade, were lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think stocks are kind of consolidating and maybe it\u2019s going to go on for a couple of days,\u201d Lee said. He added that stocks could start to perk up late in the week, and investors are expecting stocks to head higher into year end. \u201cThe cyclicals have held up like champs, and the small caps, and value have been really holding up,\u201d Lee said.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 slightly lower, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%. The Russell 2000 was the star performer, with a gain of 2.4% for the week. The Russell is up 16% since the beginning of October.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P shot up sharply on Nov. 9 when Pfizer announced its vaccine as 95% effective, but it never regained that intraday high of 3,645 and has since traded in a sideways pattern. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 3,557 Friday, down 0.8% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan economists warned Friday that the \u201cwinter will be grim\u201d and they forecast that the restrictions due to the virus will drag on the economy, resulting in a negative first quarter. They expect a strong rebound in the second and third quarter, once the vaccine is distributed and an anticipated fiscal stimulus program takes hold.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s hard for some investors to look over that period and see the recovery. I think this is where we are now,\u201d said Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management CIO. She said the concern is how much damage the restrictions will do as the virus spreads at a record rate. \u201cThis is happening and with exponential force right now. It\u2019s just shocking to see the numbers and how state and local authorities are trying to deal with it in a variety of ways.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Nixon said she\u2019s very positive on the market longer term, and the economy will heal once the vaccine becomes available. She said fiscal stimulus from Washington would help.\n*****\n&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled he would again discuss a package with Democrats, and that funds that were being used for Fed programs could be diverted to a fiscal package.\n*****\n&gt; The Treasury Thursday indicated it would not continue five of the Fed\u2019s emergency program from when they expire at year end, surprising some in the markets. The Fed objected, but the markets took the development in stride, as traders expect the programs to be reinstated if financial conditions warrant it.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed releases the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and that could be important as traders are watching to see if the central bank reveals any detail of discussions on potential changes to its asset buying program. There is widespread speculation the Fed could tweak its $80 billion Treasury buying program at the December meeting to include more longer duration notes and bonds, a move that should hold down already low long-term rates.\n*****\n&gt; Also in the week ahead, there is some key data including personal income and spending and durable goods on Wednesday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Wednesday. There are also a few Fed speakers, who will be watched closely for any comments on the expiring programs.\n*****\n&gt; Any word on fiscal stimulus talks will get market attention, though there is skepticism anything will before next year. If a package is not passed, the unemployment benefits going to 12 million Americans will end at the end of December, and mortgage forbearance will end. Bank of America economists said if there is no stimulus package to prevent these things, there would be a 1.5 percentage point drag on first quarter growth.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe biggest thing we need to do is prevent bankruptcies and prevent unemployment from rising,\u201d Nixon said. She said the labor market has stalled, and it is important to avoid the deep scarring from bankruptcies.\n*****\n&gt; She said it is not too late for investors to get in on the rotation into growth,and some investors are worried they didn\u2019t get in on time. \u201cValue has so much to go to catch up on growth,\u201d she said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Dt851zw.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/z0QkpJg.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/C6pCv7E.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/oZTJQHz.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cvWS8RF.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8Ne631r.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zxKBLlJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7rkxdbu.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oc4y8Xg.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Cr8W4RY.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZLXSTFW.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/6y6L8lt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Thanksgiving Trade\n\n&gt; Trading around Thanksgiving has a bullish tendency perhaps buoyed by the \u201choliday spirit.\u201d First published in the 1987 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&amp;P 500 decline was in 1964.\n\n&gt; Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 33 years since 1987, there have been 9 declines and 24 advances. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness on Monday or Tuesday of Thanksgiving week and selling into any subsequent rally by the end of Thanksgiving week. But as COVID-19 cases are on the rise again remain nimble as exogenous events like Greece\u2019s debt crisis in 2011 or 2018\u2019s fourth quarter rout can cancel Thanksgiving on Wall Street.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b5ce4af9292059c4d14b95baeef02b2c/d8ddf7af01919e17-07/s1280x1920/c4a8ff5b8e431b28dd3e24654e98204861afd94d.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Also of note is the change in the yearend rally. Prior to 1987, from the close of trading on the Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend, the S&amp;P 500 rallied only 20 times in 35 years. As Thanksgiving bullishness lost steam in 1987, the rally afterwards occurred more frequently. Since 1987, S&amp;P 500 has logged gains in 25 of 33 years from the close on Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Noteworthy Charts To Watch As Stocks Soar\n\n&gt; First, the big economic data point this week was retail sales. Although the headline number was a little light at 0.3% versus an expected 0.5% gain month-over-month, it still hit another new all-time high along the way (source: US Census Bureau). \u201cThe miss could be a sign the consumer is finally starting to slow amid record COVID-19 cases and more restrictions, with restaurant sales dipping for the first time since April,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; The good news is retail sales has hit a new high for five consecutive months, and the economy has never been in a recession after three consecutive new highs\u2014yet another sign the recession may be over, even if it hasn\u2019t been called officially.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; How strong has the recent rally been? Well, as of Tuesday\u2019s close, the S&amp;P 500 Index was on pace to have its second-best month of November ever. November isn\u2019t over yet of course, but this could open the door to a potential late-month snap back lower after a huge move, which would be perfectly normal and healthy.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; After Monday\u2019s record close, the S&amp;P 500 now has 24 new all-time high closes in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The surge after the election was historic in many ways. The number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 recently making new monthly highs caught our attention. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, previous surges in new monthly highs opened the door for near-term weakness, but the weakness was a nice buying opportunity. In fact, a year after previous major breadth thrusts saw stocks higher every single time, not something we want to ignore.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, more than 85% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 recently were above their 200-day moving average\u2014another sign of impressive participation in this recent market strength. Once again, future results would suggest this extreme strength is a sign of potential future strong performance and weakness could be used as a buying opportunity.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Slow\n\n&gt; The October Retail Sales report missed expectations this morning on both a headline and core basis. In addition to the weaker than expected reading for October, September's report was also revised lower.\n\n&gt; Breadth in this month\u2019s report was also negative for the first time since April. Of the thirteen sectors tracked in the report, just five showed growth while eight declined. On the positive side, Non-Store retail was the main bright spot with m/m growth of 3.11%. That\u2019s the last thing every traditional retailer wants to hear and could be indicative of another wave of retrenchment on the part of consumers as the weather gets colder and case counts rise. Electronics and Appliances also reported strong sales growth likely aided by the launch of the iPhone 12. On the downside, Clothing and Sporting Goods both saw m/m declines of over 4%, while sales at General Merchandise retailers dropped 1.1%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-retail-by-category.png))**\n\n&gt; While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Finally A New High for Small Caps\n\n&gt; It only took over two years, but the Russell 2000 finally put in a new all-time high on Friday. As shown in the charts below, Friday marked the first all-time high on a closing basis since August 31st, 2018; a total of 553 trading days between highs. As shown in the second chart below, since the index began trading in the late 80's, that makes for the third-longest stretch without a new high. The only two longer periods were from March 10th, 2000 through April 2nd, 2004 and from July 16, 2007 through April 26th, 2011. Both of those streaks were nearly twice as long as the past two years' streak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-R2000.png))**\n\n&gt; The Russell 2000 is up another 2% to more fresh highs this morning, but the recent move to new highs has left the index very overbought. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, at Friday's close small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) are two of the most overbought major index ETFs after having seen some of the strongest performance over the past five days. Granted, as other large-cap indices like the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) were quicker to return to all-time highs earlier this year making them some of the stronger performers on the year, small caps have been laggards on a year to date basis. In other words, this year's weakest performers have been a factor in recent strength.

Stock returns so far this month have been extraordinary, and what makes the gains even more impressive is the fact that they came not from a starting point of a depressed bear-market environment but instead from a level that was already pretty close to record highs. Within the Russell 3000, which encompasses stocks with market caps of all sizes, the average MTD performance of stocks in the index is a gain of over 15%. Even in the large-cap S&amp;P 500, the average stock in the index has rallied more than 13.5% so far this month! Keep in mind too that these are just averages, and plenty of individual stocks are up multiples of that.\n\n&gt; In the Russell 3000, there are 51 stocks that are up over 50% so far in November. We don't have enough room to list them all, but the first table below shows the twenty top performers. Topping the list is Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX), which has rallied more than 349% this month! That's years worth of returns in sixteen days. Behind FPRX, there are two other stocks - Cooper Standard (CPS) and Revlon (REV) - which have both more than doubled. Many of the names listed below are unknown small caps, but a handful of names like Transocean (RIG), Coty (COTY), and Lyft (LYFT) are very well known.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-RAY-MTD.png))**\n\n&gt; In the large-cap S&amp;P 500, the gains haven't been as gaudy but are still impressive. As shown in the table below, the twenty top-performing stocks in the index are all up over 30% MTD. One sector well represented on this list is Energy with eight of the twenty names listed coming from that sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-SP-MTD1.png))**\n\n&gt; While just about every stock in the S&amp;P 500 is up this month, 18 stocks have managed to trade lower. Of these 18 stocks, only two - Hanesbrands (HBI) and NortonLifeLock (NLOK) - are down more than 5%. What's really interesting about this list, however, is that while Energy dominates the list of S&amp;P 500 winners, no sector dominates the list of losers as it's a diverse set of stocks spanning ten of the eleven GICS sectors. The only sector not represented is Industrials.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Worst-SP-MTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Long Term Averages Taken Out\n\n&gt; With equities having another strong day yesterday, a large number of stocks closed above their 200-DMAs. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, nearly 90% of the index closed above their long term moving averages. That was the highest percentage for the broad index since July 3rd, 2014. As equities pullback today, that reading is lower at 86.56% as of this writing which is still in the 90th percentile of readings since 1990.\n\n&gt; As shown in the charts below, the same applies on a sector by sector basis as well. Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Financials, Industrials, and Materials all currently boast readings above 90%. For Consumer Discretionary, there have been a few similarly high readings since the start of the month, and these have all been the highest on record since at least 1990. For other sectors, recent readings have similarly been at multi-year highs. Levels for Communication Services, Health Care, and Materials, are all their highest since September or late August, but for others, it has been much longer since we saw similar readings. For example, the last time Industrials saw as high of a percentage of stocks above their 200-DMA was way back in May of 2013, and for Consumer Staples, the last higher reading was in October of 2013. The sector that has the weakest number of stocks above their 200-DMAs is unsurprisingly Energy. Whereas yesterday exactly half of the stocks in the Energy sector finished above their 200-DMA, today less than a third remain above that level. Granted, that is far better than the end of October when not even 5% were above.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-200-Day.png))**\n\n&gt; In the table below, we show a list of the S&amp;P 500 Energy sector's components showing how far each is above/below their 200-day moving average as well as the MTD and YTD performance. Baker Hughes (BKR), Halliburton (HAL), and Marathon (MPC) are all the most elevated, currently above their 200-DMAs by double-digit percentages. TechnipFMC (FTI) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) have been the top performers in the sector, but they both still sit a few percentage points below their 50-DMAs even after rallies of more than 40% this month. The only Energy sector stock to have fallen in what has been a remarkably strong month is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is one of the best performers YTD with a decline of just 2.4%. Still, its recent decline leaves it as one of the furthest below its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-200-DMA-table2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks Flying Around the Globe\n\n&gt; Since bottoming on the last trading day of November, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has had a banner month so far this November rising 10.61% month to date. While there is still nearly two weeks left in the month, SPY is on pace for its best month since April. That is also in the top 1% of monthly moves of the past two decades. Other than April, the only month of the past 20 years that has seen a larger gain was October of 2011.\n\n&gt; Looking across the various country ETFs in our Global Macro Dashboard, there similarly have been some massive moves so far this month. Several of these have risen over 20% and only two, India (INDA) and China (MSHI), have risen by single-digit percentages. Spain (EWP), Italy (EWI), France (EWQ), Mexico (EWW), Norway (ENOR), and the UK (EWU) are all on pace for their best month of the past twenty years. Every other country ETF is also seeing monthly moves in the top decile of their respective 20-year ranges. For some of these, like Singapore (EWS) or Switzerland (EWL), this month has been the best month in over a decade.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111820-Country-ETF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/oc4y8Xg.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQbUx7g.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BMoOMlV.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/36x74Ed.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/l4A2Jya.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NDGIEPk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9El1A8i.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks may continue to struggle Thanksgiving week amid Covid-19 outbreaks  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/stocks-may-continue-to-struggle-thanksgiving-week-amid-covid-19-outbreaks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks could continue to struggle with the twin themes of the spreading virus and a potentially robust recovery, once a vaccine is deployed next year.\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, the restrictions the spreading virus is imposing on the economy will be clear, when many Americans choose to stay at home over the Thanksgiving Day holiday and partake in much smaller celebrations.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn the Covid side, there will be more lockdowns, but I think the message is loud and clear. \u2018People: Don\u2019t be cavalier around Thanksgiving,\u2019\u201d said Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat. Thanksgiving traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season, an important time of the year for the economy which could be hobbled by Covid. The U.S. reported 182,000 new cases Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Lee said the market will continue to feel the push pull of the drag from the pandemic against the promise of recovery, seen in the rebound of cyclical stocks. Cyclical sectors industrials and materials were both up about 1% for the week, and financials were up a half percent. But tech and communications, both big tech and growth sectors that benefited from the stay-at-home trade, were lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think stocks are kind of consolidating and maybe it\u2019s going to go on for a couple of days,\u201d Lee said. He added that stocks could start to perk up late in the week, and investors are expecting stocks to head higher into year end. \u201cThe cyclicals have held up like champs, and the small caps, and value have been really holding up,\u201d Lee said.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 slightly lower, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%. The Russell 2000 was the star performer, with a gain of 2.4% for the week. The Russell is up 16% since the beginning of October.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P shot up sharply on Nov. 9 when Pfizer announced its vaccine as 95% effective, but it never regained that intraday high of 3,645 and has since traded in a sideways pattern. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 3,557 Friday, down 0.8% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan economists warned Friday that the \u201cwinter will be grim\u201d and they forecast that the restrictions due to the virus will drag on the economy, resulting in a negative first quarter. They expect a strong rebound in the second and third quarter, once the vaccine is distributed and an anticipated fiscal stimulus program takes hold.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s hard for some investors to look over that period and see the recovery. I think this is where we are now,\u201d said Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management CIO. She said the concern is how much damage the restrictions will do as the virus spreads at a record rate. \u201cThis is happening and with exponential force right now. It\u2019s just shocking to see the numbers and how state and local authorities are trying to deal with it in a variety of ways.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Nixon said she\u2019s very positive on the market longer term, and the economy will heal once the vaccine becomes available. She said fiscal stimulus from Washington would help.\n*****\n&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled he would again discuss a package with Democrats, and that funds that were being used for Fed programs could be diverted to a fiscal package.\n*****\n&gt; The Treasury Thursday indicated it would not continue five of the Fed\u2019s emergency program from when they expire at year end, surprising some in the markets. The Fed objected, but the markets took the development in stride, as traders expect the programs to be reinstated if financial conditions warrant it.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed releases the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and that could be important as traders are watching to see if the central bank reveals any detail of discussions on potential changes to its asset buying program. There is widespread speculation the Fed could tweak its $80 billion Treasury buying program at the December meeting to include more longer duration notes and bonds, a move that should hold down already low long-term rates.\n*****\n&gt; Also in the week ahead, there is some key data including personal income and spending and durable goods on Wednesday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Wednesday. There are also a few Fed speakers, who will be watched closely for any comments on the expiring programs.\n*****\n&gt; Any word on fiscal stimulus talks will get market attention, though there is skepticism anything will before next year. If a package is not passed, the unemployment benefits going to 12 million Americans will end at the end of December, and mortgage forbearance will end. Bank of America economists said if there is no stimulus package to prevent these things, there would be a 1.5 percentage point drag on first quarter growth.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe biggest thing we need to do is prevent bankruptcies and prevent unemployment from rising,\u201d Nixon said. She said the labor market has stalled, and it is important to avoid the deep scarring from bankruptcies.\n*****\n&gt; She said it is not too late for investors to get in on the rotation into growth,and some investors are worried they didn\u2019t get in on time. \u201cValue has so much to go to catch up on growth,\u201d she said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Dt851zw.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/z0QkpJg.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/C6pCv7E.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/oZTJQHz.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cvWS8RF.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8Ne631r.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zxKBLlJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7rkxdbu.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oc4y8Xg.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Cr8W4RY.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZLXSTFW.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/6y6L8lt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Thanksgiving Trade\n\n&gt; Trading around Thanksgiving has a bullish tendency perhaps buoyed by the \u201choliday spirit.\u201d First published in the 1987 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&amp;P 500 decline was in 1964.\n\n&gt; Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 33 years since 1987, there have been 9 declines and 24 advances. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness on Monday or Tuesday of Thanksgiving week and selling into any subsequent rally by the end of Thanksgiving week. But as COVID-19 cases are on the rise again remain nimble as exogenous events like Greece\u2019s debt crisis in 2011 or 2018\u2019s fourth quarter rout can cancel Thanksgiving on Wall Street.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b5ce4af9292059c4d14b95baeef02b2c/d8ddf7af01919e17-07/s1280x1920/c4a8ff5b8e431b28dd3e24654e98204861afd94d.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Also of note is the change in the yearend rally. Prior to 1987, from the close of trading on the Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend, the S&amp;P 500 rallied only 20 times in 35 years. As Thanksgiving bullishness lost steam in 1987, the rally afterwards occurred more frequently. Since 1987, S&amp;P 500 has logged gains in 25 of 33 years from the close on Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Noteworthy Charts To Watch As Stocks Soar\n\n&gt; First, the big economic data point this week was retail sales. Although the headline number was a little light at 0.3% versus an expected 0.5% gain month-over-month, it still hit another new all-time high along the way (source: US Census Bureau). \u201cThe miss could be a sign the consumer is finally starting to slow amid record COVID-19 cases and more restrictions, with restaurant sales dipping for the first time since April,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; The good news is retail sales has hit a new high for five consecutive months, and the economy has never been in a recession after three consecutive new highs\u2014yet another sign the recession may be over, even if it hasn\u2019t been called officially.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; How strong has the recent rally been? Well, as of Tuesday\u2019s close, the S&amp;P 500 Index was on pace to have its second-best month of November ever. November isn\u2019t over yet of course, but this could open the door to a potential late-month snap back lower after a huge move, which would be perfectly normal and healthy.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; After Monday\u2019s record close, the S&amp;P 500 now has 24 new all-time high closes in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The surge after the election was historic in many ways. The number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 recently making new monthly highs caught our attention. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, previous surges in new monthly highs opened the door for near-term weakness, but the weakness was a nice buying opportunity. In fact, a year after previous major breadth thrusts saw stocks higher every single time, not something we want to ignore.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, more than 85% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 recently were above their 200-day moving average\u2014another sign of impressive participation in this recent market strength. Once again, future results would suggest this extreme strength is a sign of potential future strong performance and weakness could be used as a buying opportunity.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Slow\n\n&gt; The October Retail Sales report missed expectations this morning on both a headline and core basis. In addition to the weaker than expected reading for October, September's report was also revised lower.\n\n&gt; Breadth in this month\u2019s report was also negative for the first time since April. Of the thirteen sectors tracked in the report, just five showed growth while eight declined. On the positive side, Non-Store retail was the main bright spot with m/m growth of 3.11%. That\u2019s the last thing every traditional retailer wants to hear and could be indicative of another wave of retrenchment on the part of consumers as the weather gets colder and case counts rise. Electronics and Appliances also reported strong sales growth likely aided by the launch of the iPhone 12. On the downside, Clothing and Sporting Goods both saw m/m declines of over 4%, while sales at General Merchandise retailers dropped 1.1%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-retail-by-category.png))**\n\n&gt; While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Finally A New High for Small Caps\n\n&gt; It only took over two years, but the Russell 2000 finally put in a new all-time high on Friday. As shown in the charts below, Friday marked the first all-time high on a closing basis since August 31st, 2018; a total of 553 trading days between highs. As shown in the second chart below, since the index began trading in the late 80's, that makes for the third-longest stretch without a new high. The only two longer periods were from March 10th, 2000 through April 2nd, 2004 and from July 16, 2007 through April 26th, 2011. Both of those streaks were nearly twice as long as the past two years' streak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-R2000.png))**\n\n&gt; The Russell 2000 is up another 2% to more fresh highs this morning, but the recent move to new highs has left the index very overbought. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, at Friday's close small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) are two of the most overbought major index ETFs after having seen some of the strongest performance over the past five days. Granted, as other large-cap indices like the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) were quicker to return to all-time highs earlier this year making them some of the stronger performers on the year, small caps have been laggards on a year to date basis. In other words, this year's weakest performers have been a factor in recent strength.

Stock returns so far this month have been extraordinary, and what makes the gains even more impressive is the fact that they came not from a starting point of a depressed bear-market environment but instead from a level that was already pretty close to record highs. Within the Russell 3000, which encompasses stocks with market caps of all sizes, the average MTD performance of stocks in the index is a gain of over 15%. Even in the large-cap S&amp;P 500, the average stock in the index has rallied more than 13.5% so far this month! Keep in mind too that these are just averages, and plenty of individual stocks are up multiples of that.\n\n&gt; In the Russell 3000, there are 51 stocks that are up over 50% so far in November. We don't have enough room to list them all, but the first table below shows the twenty top performers. Topping the list is Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX), which has rallied more than 349% this month! That's years worth of returns in sixteen days. Behind FPRX, there are two other stocks - Cooper Standard (CPS) and Revlon (REV) - which have both more than doubled. Many of the names listed below are unknown small caps, but a handful of names like Transocean (RIG), Coty (COTY), and Lyft (LYFT) are very well known.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-RAY-MTD.png))**\n\n&gt; In the large-cap S&amp;P 500, the gains haven't been as gaudy but are still impressive. As shown in the table below, the twenty top-performing stocks in the index are all up over 30% MTD. One sector well represented on this list is Energy with eight of the twenty names listed coming from that sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-SP-MTD1.png))**\n\n&gt; While just about every stock in the S&amp;P 500 is up this month, 18 stocks have managed to trade lower. Of these 18 stocks, only two - Hanesbrands (HBI) and NortonLifeLock (NLOK) - are down more than 5%. What's really interesting about this list, however, is that while Energy dominates the list of S&amp;P 500 winners, no sector dominates the list of losers as it's a diverse set of stocks spanning ten of the eleven GICS sectors. The only sector not represented is Industrials.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Worst-SP-MTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Long Term Averages Taken Out\n\n&gt; With equities having another strong day yesterday, a large number of stocks closed above their 200-DMAs. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, nearly 90% of the index closed above their long term moving averages. That was the highest percentage for the broad index since July 3rd, 2014. As equities pullback today, that reading is lower at 86.56% as of this writing which is still in the 90th percentile of readings since 1990.\n\n&gt; As shown in the charts below, the same applies on a sector by sector basis as well. Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Financials, Industrials, and Materials all currently boast readings above 90%. For Consumer Discretionary, there have been a few similarly high readings since the start of the month, and these have all been the highest on record since at least 1990. For other sectors, recent readings have similarly been at multi-year highs. Levels for Communication Services, Health Care, and Materials, are all their highest since September or late August, but for others, it has been much longer since we saw similar readings. For example, the last time Industrials saw as high of a percentage of stocks above their 200-DMA was way back in May of 2013, and for Consumer Staples, the last higher reading was in October of 2013. The sector that has the weakest number of stocks above their 200-DMAs is unsurprisingly Energy. Whereas yesterday exactly half of the stocks in the Energy sector finished above their 200-DMA, today less than a third remain above that level. Granted, that is far better than the end of October when not even 5% were above.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-200-Day.png))**\n\n&gt; In the table below, we show a list of the S&amp;P 500 Energy sector's components showing how far each is above/below their 200-day moving average as well as the MTD and YTD performance. Baker Hughes (BKR), Halliburton (HAL), and Marathon (MPC) are all the most elevated, currently above their 200-DMAs by double-digit percentages. TechnipFMC (FTI) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) have been the top performers in the sector, but they both still sit a few percentage points below their 50-DMAs even after rallies of more than 40% this month. The only Energy sector stock to have fallen in what has been a remarkably strong month is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is one of the best performers YTD with a decline of just 2.4%. Still, its recent decline leaves it as one of the furthest below its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-200-DMA-table2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks Flying Around the Globe\n\n&gt; Since bottoming on the last trading day of November, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has had a banner month so far this November rising 10.61% month to date. While there is still nearly two weeks left in the month, SPY is on pace for its best month since April. That is also in the top 1% of monthly moves of the past two decades. Other than April, the only month of the past 20 years that has seen a larger gain was October of 2011.\n\n&gt; Looking across the various country ETFs in our Global Macro Dashboard, there similarly have been some massive moves so far this month. Several of these have risen over 20% and only two, India (INDA) and China (MSHI), have risen by single-digit percentages. Spain (EWP), Italy (EWI), France (EWQ), Mexico (EWW), Norway (ENOR), and the UK (EWU) are all on pace for their best month of the past twenty years. Every other country ETF is also seeing monthly moves in the top decile of their respective 20-year ranges. For some of these, like Singapore (EWS) or Switzerland (EWL), this month has been the best month in over a decade.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111820-Country-ETF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/oc4y8Xg.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQbUx7g.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BMoOMlV.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/36x74Ed.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/l4A2Jya.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NDGIEPk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9El1A8i.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

About two months ago, it was celebrating $200 billion. It first hit $100 billion in January.\n\nTesla passed Johnson &amp; Johnson \ufffc (JNJ) along the way on Wednesday, in terms of market cap. There are only seven companies in the S&amp;P 500 index worth more, including Visa \ufffc (V) at $447 billon and Apple \ufffc (AAPL) at $2.16 trillion.\n\nThere is a lot you could buy for $400 billion. Here are a few notable   comparisons to put that figure in context.\n\nIt\u2019s more than the combined value of every team in the four major U.S. professional sports, according to Forbes estimates. It\u2019s also more than the Forbes estimate for the combined net worth of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla\u2019s own CEO Elon Musk.\n\nIt\u2019s nearly four times International Business Machines \ufffc\u2019 (IBM) market cap.\n\nYou could buy 400 billion things at a dollar store\u2014or just buy Dollar General \ufffc (DG) and Dollar Tree \ufffc (DLTR).\n\nIt\u2019s also more than the individual gross domestic product of Israel, Ireland, and Hong Kong.\n\nWith $400 billion, you could also stockpile about 181 billion regular gallons of gas, based on AAA\u2019s U.S. estimates. You could drive 5.79 trillion miles, if you averaged 32 miles per gallon.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets look to the Fed again to build on S&amp;P 500 record as Congress continues to disappoint  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/markets-look-to-the-fed-again-to-build-on-sp-500-record-as-congress-continues-to-disappoint.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed\u2019s anticipated policy framework review.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed\u2019s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we know the Fed\u2019s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You\u2019re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed\u2019s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed\u2019s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.\n*****\n&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let\u2019s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they\u2019re not going to stop it,\u201d said Caron. \u201cThey\u2019re going to stay there for awhile. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to communicate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Where\u2019s the stimulus?\n&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the thing I\u2019m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the politics are shifting beneath that.\u201d He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.\n*****\n&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.\n*****\n&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,\u201d said Keon. \u201cAs the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don\u2019t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It\u2019s not panicking about it.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. \u201cAs the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. \u201cDemocrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,\u201d said Mills.\n*****\n&gt; # It\u2019s the economy\n&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.\n*****\n&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.\n*****\n&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/0FgKliy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yHvkn2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/L2S9kUV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/kgk42Nv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cMOmbjC.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kCvYfYX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jwR8nq6.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nSC6K2N.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/bwcCQMYv/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/yxfJ72fy/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/3Nr453Zw/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years\n\n&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September\u2019s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September\u2019s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs\n\n&gt; \u201cBetter late than never.\u201d\n\n&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThis will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThen again, we\u2019ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn\u2019t a shock to see new highs this quickly.\u201d\n\n&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there\u2019s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early \u201880s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early \u201890s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February \u201961, July \u201980, November \u201982, and March \u201991. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)\n\n&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.\n\n&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.\n\n&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion.

Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays\n\n&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.\n\n&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.\n\n&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**\n\n&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven\u2019t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report.

Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed\u2019s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we know the Fed\u2019s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You\u2019re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed\u2019s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed\u2019s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.\n*****\n&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let\u2019s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they\u2019re not going to stop it,\u201d said Caron. \u201cThey\u2019re going to stay there for awhile. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to communicate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Where\u2019s the stimulus?\n&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the thing I\u2019m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the politics are shifting beneath that.\u201d He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.\n*****\n&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.\n*****\n&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,\u201d said Keon. \u201cAs the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don\u2019t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It\u2019s not panicking about it.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. \u201cAs the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. \u201cDemocrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,\u201d said Mills.\n*****\n&gt; # It\u2019s the economy\n&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.\n*****\n&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.\n*****\n&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/0FgKliy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yHvkn2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/L2S9kUV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/kgk42Nv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cMOmbjC.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kCvYfYX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jwR8nq6.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nSC6K2N.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/bwcCQMYv/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/yxfJ72fy/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/3Nr453Zw/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years\n\n&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September\u2019s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September\u2019s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs\n\n&gt; \u201cBetter late than never.\u201d\n\n&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThis will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThen again, we\u2019ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn\u2019t a shock to see new highs this quickly.\u201d\n\n&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there\u2019s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early \u201880s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early \u201890s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February \u201961, July \u201980, November \u201982, and March \u201991. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)\n\n&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.\n\n&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.\n\n&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion.

Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays\n\n&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.\n\n&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.\n\n&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**\n\n&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven\u2019t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they\u2019ve actually given us credit for coining the \u201ctriple play\u201d term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.\n\n&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 21st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO LINK REMOVED DUE TO R/STOCKS AUTO MOD!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.23.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO LINK REMOVED DUE TO R/STOCKS AUTO MOD!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$DKS** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$SJM** \n&gt; * **$ICLK** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$BIG** \n&gt; * **$COTY** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$BOX** \n&gt; * **$SPLK**\n&gt; * **$BNS** \n&gt; * **$TOL** \n&gt; * **$VMW** \n&gt; * **$BMO** \n&gt; * **$TD** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$HPE** \n&gt; * **$DELL** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$FLWS** \n&gt; * **$VIOT** \n&gt; * **$RY** \n&gt; * **$HPQ** \n&gt; * **$SOL** \n&gt; * **$BITA** \n&gt; * **$ATHM** \n&gt; * **$NTAP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/FKXPQh9j/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST INCREASE IN EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/G3q2ZwT4/erincrease1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RwgQ9SD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mvBOGth.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY6k2e0.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rx2gJbQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zKSTcN5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/B3hFxJN.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wqQ6cS6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tln4z5V.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7xetbo6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Buy Co., Inc. $114.00\n&gt; **Best Buy Co., Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 25th, 2020.\n\n# **Market could get a boost as states reopen, but new economic data will show just how bad things got during shutdowns  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/22/market-could-get-a-boost-as-states-reopen-but-new-economic-data-will-show-just-how-bad-things-got-during-shutdowns.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks are likely to hang on every medical development and the progress of state reopenings, but there will also be some key economic data in the coming week that should provide a glimpse into the depths of the state shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s beige book of economic activity is released Wednesday afternoon. There is also April manufacturing data in durable goods Thursday and April\u2019s consumer income and spending data Friday. While that should provide an interesting view of how sluggish activity became, the market is expected to focus more on May consumer confidence Tuesday and consumer sentiment Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe backward looking data is not going to get any attention paid to it,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be terrible, and that\u2019s not going to be a surprise. Confidence has held up pretty well, all things considered. It\u2019s the PPP and unemployment benefits. People who get some support for income seem to be pretty confident.\u201d Congress is expected to take up changes to the Paycheck Protection Program for small business when it returns June 1.\n*****\n&gt; April\u2019s economic data is expected to be about the worst of the recession, since most state shutdowns extended through a good part of the month, ahead of May reopenings. First quarter gross domestic product is expected to have declined by 4.8% when a second reading is released Wednesday, but for the second quarter, GDP is expected to decline by a median 33.1%, according to CNBC/Moody\u2019s Analytics Rapid Update, a survey of economists.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, though rising tensions between the U.S. and China weighed on the market Thursday and Friday and could become a bigger headwind.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was heading for a weekly gain of 3%, its second weekly gain in three. A big catalyst came Monday, when Moderna disclosed positive data from a small group of patients in an early trial, but it was a wild week of trading for the company\u2019s stock as doubts arose about its limited results. On Friday, however, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the data showed promise and he was cautiously optimistic a vaccine would be developed.\n*****\n&gt; Astra Zeneca\u2019s vaccine effort got a boost this week when it received $1 billion from the U.S. Health Department\u2019s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop a coronavirus vaccine from the University of Oxford.\n*****\n&gt; With investors focused on vaccines and state reopenings, market winners were the more volatile Russell 2000, up 7.8% for the week and the Dow Transports, up nearly 9.1% as airlines and other reopening stocks rallied. Airlines were up nearly 20% on the week. After a batch of earnings reports, retailers were also higher on the week, with the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF up 6% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Retailers are again among the companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, as the first quarter reporting season winds down. Costco, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty and Burlington Stores are some of the names reporting.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said he is watching the economic reopenings and says the success really depends on the behavior of individuals, and whether there\u2019s another spike in infections.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople are still scared,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the personal behavior that\u2019s going to make a difference to economic behavior. We\u2019ll get back to some semblance of normal. It\u2019s going to take awhile for people to feel more confident.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He expects to see a rebound of economic activity in the second half of the year, but not a V-shaped recovery.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBy the end of the year, if we don\u2019t get a vaccine, we will have made a lot of progress on a vaccine. I\u2019m still cautiously optimistic that the market can hang in, and maybe end the year a little bit higher,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; One big reopening in the week ahead will be on Tuesday when the iconic NYSE trading floor reopens.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AUZd4pd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TGBcnTP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DjoySnm.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yJXH3jZ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Q0QEkmb.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c5ZprTz.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jn7Momp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ym1qBMT.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Mr8CSMQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FPry3Mw.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QGY45ds.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qjKjCb6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/KiRgaMa.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Weekly Market Performance \u2013 May 22, 2020: Stocks Solid in the Midst of Health and Political Challenges\n\n&gt; # Equities\n\n&gt; US equities delivered solid returns this week. With three hours to go in the week, all three markets were up almost 3% for the week, with the best performer, once again, the technology-heavy Nasdaq. The small cap Russell 2000 Index enjoyed an impressive rally, with the index returning over 9% for the week. The mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index also had a solid showing, returning almost 9%.\n\n&gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, rising unemployment, and risks associated with reopening the economy, US stocks continued to rebound. The rally was supported by all 50 states easing restrictions, based on improving COIVD-19 trends. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, including higher credit and debit card spending and an increase in travelers based on TSA data. Second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe S&amp;P 500 just had the second-best 40-day rally ever, with only the returns off the March 2009 lows better,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNear-term, we have some concerns of a well-deserved pullback, but historically, these huge moves have tended to resolve much higher over the ensuing 6- and 12-month periods.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.22.20-wmp.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; In a change of pace, industrials were the top-performing sector for the week, followed by the energy sector. The worst-performing sectors were healthcare and consumer staples, and they posted returns that were slightly negative for the week. Looking at style, large cap value stocks edged out large cap growth for the week.\n\n*****\n\n# Leading Indicators Signal Potential Bottom\n\n&gt; Leading economic indicators are signaling that the pace of economic deterioration may be slowing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of leading data series, fell 4.4% month over month in April. While this is an undeniably abysmal reading, it is an improvement from the -7.4% in March.\n\n&gt; \u201dThe monthly LEI change tends to bottom early in a recession, and sometimes even before a recession\u2019s official start,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cStocks are forward looking, so if investors feel confident that the economic damage will not accelerate from here, they may be more willing to put capital to work. We think today\u2019s LEI number largely confirms April\u2019s strong moves in the equity markets.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Economic-news-5.22.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The performance of the 10 underlying components in the LEI does indicate some disconnect between financial markets and the real economy. The two largest positive contributors to the headline LEI number this month were stock prices and the interest rate spread, which were buoyed by a swift and robust monetary and fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, data series related to manufacturing, unemployment, and construction hurt the index, a reflection of the damage done to the parts of the economy in which workers are unable to perform their jobs remotely.\n\n&gt; As local economies begin to reopen, we look for the industries disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 virus to begin to rebound. While this will likely be a bumpy process, progress will likely become evident in future LEI releases and confirm that the worst of the economic declines are behind us. We think this should pave the way for further equity gains over a long-term horizon.\n\n*****\n\n# What Happens When The Bear Ends?\n\n&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 lows continues for equities, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 32% in 40 trading days. As impressive as the rally has been, we do have some near-term concerns, as we discussed in Downside Risk Remains. Higher valuations, US-/China relations, weakening technicals, and the historically troublesome summer months all could play a part in potential weakness after the record run.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn 40 trading days, the S&amp;P 500 gained 32%, which is second only to the 40 days off the March 2009 lows,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at history shows that after the initial surge off of bear lows, stocks tend to correct about 10%, which is something we could see this time around.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 rallied nearly 21% in 30 days after all major bear markets. But once those initial rallies ended, there was a correction of more than 10% on average. Bottoms are a process, and as impressive as this run has been, we think the odds are quite high for some type of pullback or correction over the coming months. Thanks to our friends at Strategas Research Partners for the data points below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.20.20-blog-chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Bottom Line EPS Beat Rate Below Average\n\n&gt; The first quarter earnings reporting period unofficially came to an end earlier this week, and it should be considered quite a success given how well the equity market performed during this time period. Since earnings season began on April 13th, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has gained more than 5%. Of course, the market's performance over the last month or so has much more to do with expectations on re-opening than how companies reported in Q1, but all things considered, the sky didn't fall when it came to earnings results.\n\n&gt; In terms of how actual earnings reports came in versus analyst expectations this past earnings season, the trend wasn't all that rosy. We've been tracking \"beat rates\" for more than a decade, which measure the percentage of companies reporting stronger than expected EPS and sales numbers (relative to consensus analyst estimates). Our main \"beat rate\" trackers show beat rates on a rolling 3-month basis -- meaning it looks at all companies that have reported earnings over the last three months and tells you what percentage of them beat analyst estimates.\n\n&gt; Below is a snapshot of both bottom-line EPS and top-line sales beat rates over the last five years as displayed on our website at our \"Earnings Explorer\" page. Notably, bottom-line EPS beat rates have been weakening quite dramatically over the last couple of months since the COVID crisis began. Just this week, the 3-month rolling EPS beat rate dipped below its long-term average of 59.37% dating back to the year 2000.\n\n&gt; On the other hand, top-line sales beat rates haven't taken quite the hit yet. The current sales beat rate stands at 60.67%. While sales on an absolute basis fell dramatically at the end of Q1, the fact that sales beat rates haven't fallen dramatically means companies have at least managed to keep up with analyst expectations. A very weak sales beat rate would have meant companies were reporting numbers even weaker than already dour analyst expectations.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/epsbeats.png))**\n\n&gt; We also have a forward guidance tracker that measures the percentage of companies raising guidance versus the percentage of companies lowering guidance. When this reading turns negative, it means more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance over the last three months. As shown below, right now our guidance spread stands at -16.08 percentage points, which is the weakest reading we've seen since early 2016.\n\n&gt; One thing we've seen since the COVID crisis began is that more and more companies have withdrawn guidance altogether. It's hard to blame them. The ones that have issued guidance have mostly lowered expectations. While this paints a bleak picture for the future, if you look at this from a \"glass half full\" perspective, it actually leaves much more room for positive surprises down the road.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/guidance5yr.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Down Five Straight Day After Memorial Day\n\n&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 25. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n&gt; For decades the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market\u2019s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last five years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/17c1f2e9847dc9535fcaf9721be1fd15/cf4b21edc88189d8-06/s640x960/e768e94e9f16dd65cdae2b4f8d23f15f1b3806f5.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election-Year June: Candidate Clarity Boosts Performance\n\n&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 49 years as a rule ranking seventh with a 0.8% average gain, up 27 of 49 years. This contributes to NASDAQ\u2019s \u201cBest Eight Months\u201d which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.\n\n&gt; In election years since 1950, June\u2019s performance improves notably. June is the #5 DJIA month in election years averaging a 0.9% gain with a record of twelve advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #2 with an average gain of 1.3% (14-3 record). Election-year June ranks #4 for NASDAQ and Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.6% and 1.4% respectively.

There is also April manufacturing data in durable goods Thursday and April\u2019s consumer income and spending data Friday. While that should provide an interesting view of how sluggish activity became, the market is expected to focus more on May consumer confidence Tuesday and consumer sentiment Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe backward looking data is not going to get any attention paid to it,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be terrible, and that\u2019s not going to be a surprise. Confidence has held up pretty well, all things considered. It\u2019s the PPP and unemployment benefits. People who get some support for income seem to be pretty confident.\u201d Congress is expected to take up changes to the Paycheck Protection Program for small business when it returns June 1.\n*****\n&gt; April\u2019s economic data is expected to be about the worst of the recession, since most state shutdowns extended through a good part of the month, ahead of May reopenings. First quarter gross domestic product is expected to have declined by 4.8% when a second reading is released Wednesday, but for the second quarter, GDP is expected to decline by a median 33.1%, according to CNBC/Moody\u2019s Analytics Rapid Update, a survey of economists.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, though rising tensions between the U.S. and China weighed on the market Thursday and Friday and could become a bigger headwind.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was heading for a weekly gain of 3%, its second weekly gain in three. A big catalyst came Monday, when Moderna disclosed positive data from a small group of patients in an early trial, but it was a wild week of trading for the company\u2019s stock as doubts arose about its limited results. On Friday, however, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the data showed promise and he was cautiously optimistic a vaccine would be developed.\n*****\n&gt; Astra Zeneca\u2019s vaccine effort got a boost this week when it received $1 billion from the U.S. Health Department\u2019s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop a coronavirus vaccine from the University of Oxford.\n*****\n&gt; With investors focused on vaccines and state reopenings, market winners were the more volatile Russell 2000, up 7.8% for the week and the Dow Transports, up nearly 9.1% as airlines and other reopening stocks rallied. Airlines were up nearly 20% on the week. After a batch of earnings reports, retailers were also higher on the week, with the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF up 6% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Retailers are again among the companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, as the first quarter reporting season winds down. Costco, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty and Burlington Stores are some of the names reporting.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said he is watching the economic reopenings and says the success really depends on the behavior of individuals, and whether there\u2019s another spike in infections.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople are still scared,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the personal behavior that\u2019s going to make a difference to economic behavior. We\u2019ll get back to some semblance of normal. It\u2019s going to take awhile for people to feel more confident.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He expects to see a rebound of economic activity in the second half of the year, but not a V-shaped recovery.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBy the end of the year, if we don\u2019t get a vaccine, we will have made a lot of progress on a vaccine. I\u2019m still cautiously optimistic that the market can hang in, and maybe end the year a little bit higher,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; One big reopening in the week ahead will be on Tuesday when the iconic NYSE trading floor reopens.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AUZd4pd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TGBcnTP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DjoySnm.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yJXH3jZ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Q0QEkmb.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c5ZprTz.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jn7Momp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ym1qBMT.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Mr8CSMQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FPry3Mw.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QGY45ds.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qjKjCb6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/KiRgaMa.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Weekly Market Performance \u2013 May 22, 2020: Stocks Solid in the Midst of Health and Political Challenges\n\n&gt; # Equities\n\n&gt; US equities delivered solid returns this week. With three hours to go in the week, all three markets were up almost 3% for the week, with the best performer, once again, the technology-heavy Nasdaq. The small cap Russell 2000 Index enjoyed an impressive rally, with the index returning over 9% for the week. The mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index also had a solid showing, returning almost 9%.\n\n&gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, rising unemployment, and risks associated with reopening the economy, US stocks continued to rebound. The rally was supported by all 50 states easing restrictions, based on improving COIVD-19 trends. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, including higher credit and debit card spending and an increase in travelers based on TSA data. Second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe S&amp;P 500 just had the second-best 40-day rally ever, with only the returns off the March 2009 lows better,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNear-term, we have some concerns of a well-deserved pullback, but historically, these huge moves have tended to resolve much higher over the ensuing 6- and 12-month periods.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.22.20-wmp.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; In a change of pace, industrials were the top-performing sector for the week, followed by the energy sector. The worst-performing sectors were healthcare and consumer staples, and they posted returns that were slightly negative for the week. Looking at style, large cap value stocks edged out large cap growth for the week.\n\n*****\n\n# Leading Indicators Signal Potential Bottom\n\n&gt; Leading economic indicators are signaling that the pace of economic deterioration may be slowing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of leading data series, fell 4.4% month over month in April. While this is an undeniably abysmal reading, it is an improvement from the -7.4% in March.\n\n&gt; \u201dThe monthly LEI change tends to bottom early in a recession, and sometimes even before a recession\u2019s official start,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cStocks are forward looking, so if investors feel confident that the economic damage will not accelerate from here, they may be more willing to put capital to work. We think today\u2019s LEI number largely confirms April\u2019s strong moves in the equity markets.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Economic-news-5.22.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The performance of the 10 underlying components in the LEI does indicate some disconnect between financial markets and the real economy. The two largest positive contributors to the headline LEI number this month were stock prices and the interest rate spread, which were buoyed by a swift and robust monetary and fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, data series related to manufacturing, unemployment, and construction hurt the index, a reflection of the damage done to the parts of the economy in which workers are unable to perform their jobs remotely.\n\n&gt; As local economies begin to reopen, we look for the industries disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 virus to begin to rebound. While this will likely be a bumpy process, progress will likely become evident in future LEI releases and confirm that the worst of the economic declines are behind us. We think this should pave the way for further equity gains over a long-term horizon.\n\n*****\n\n# What Happens When The Bear Ends?\n\n&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 lows continues for equities, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 32% in 40 trading days. As impressive as the rally has been, we do have some near-term concerns, as we discussed in Downside Risk Remains. Higher valuations, US-/China relations, weakening technicals, and the historically troublesome summer months all could play a part in potential weakness after the record run.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn 40 trading days, the S&amp;P 500 gained 32%, which is second only to the 40 days off the March 2009 lows,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at history shows that after the initial surge off of bear lows, stocks tend to correct about 10%, which is something we could see this time around.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 rallied nearly 21% in 30 days after all major bear markets. But once those initial rallies ended, there was a correction of more than 10% on average. Bottoms are a process, and as impressive as this run has been, we think the odds are quite high for some type of pullback or correction over the coming months. Thanks to our friends at Strategas Research Partners for the data points below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.20.20-blog-chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Bottom Line EPS Beat Rate Below Average\n\n&gt; The first quarter earnings reporting period unofficially came to an end earlier this week, and it should be considered quite a success given how well the equity market performed during this time period. Since earnings season began on April 13th, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has gained more than 5%. Of course, the market's performance over the last month or so has much more to do with expectations on re-opening than how companies reported in Q1, but all things considered, the sky didn't fall when it came to earnings results.\n\n&gt; In terms of how actual earnings reports came in versus analyst expectations this past earnings season, the trend wasn't all that rosy. We've been tracking \"beat rates\" for more than a decade, which measure the percentage of companies reporting stronger than expected EPS and sales numbers (relative to consensus analyst estimates). Our main \"beat rate\" trackers show beat rates on a rolling 3-month basis -- meaning it looks at all companies that have reported earnings over the last three months and tells you what percentage of them beat analyst estimates.\n\n&gt; Below is a snapshot of both bottom-line EPS and top-line sales beat rates over the last five years as displayed on our website at our \"Earnings Explorer\" page. Notably, bottom-line EPS beat rates have been weakening quite dramatically over the last couple of months since the COVID crisis began. Just this week, the 3-month rolling EPS beat rate dipped below its long-term average of 59.37% dating back to the year 2000.\n\n&gt; On the other hand, top-line sales beat rates haven't taken quite the hit yet. The current sales beat rate stands at 60.67%. While sales on an absolute basis fell dramatically at the end of Q1, the fact that sales beat rates haven't fallen dramatically means companies have at least managed to keep up with analyst expectations. A very weak sales beat rate would have meant companies were reporting numbers even weaker than already dour analyst expectations.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/epsbeats.png))**\n\n&gt; We also have a forward guidance tracker that measures the percentage of companies raising guidance versus the percentage of companies lowering guidance. When this reading turns negative, it means more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance over the last three months. As shown below, right now our guidance spread stands at -16.08 percentage points, which is the weakest reading we've seen since early 2016.\n\n&gt; One thing we've seen since the COVID crisis began is that more and more companies have withdrawn guidance altogether. It's hard to blame them. The ones that have issued guidance have mostly lowered expectations. While this paints a bleak picture for the future, if you look at this from a \"glass half full\" perspective, it actually leaves much more room for positive surprises down the road.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/guidance5yr.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Down Five Straight Day After Memorial Day\n\n&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 25. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n&gt; For decades the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market\u2019s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last five years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/17c1f2e9847dc9535fcaf9721be1fd15/cf4b21edc88189d8-06/s640x960/e768e94e9f16dd65cdae2b4f8d23f15f1b3806f5.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election-Year June: Candidate Clarity Boosts Performance\n\n&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 49 years as a rule ranking seventh with a 0.8% average gain, up 27 of 49 years. This contributes to NASDAQ\u2019s \u201cBest Eight Months\u201d which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.\n\n&gt; In election years since 1950, June\u2019s performance improves notably. June is the #5 DJIA month in election years averaging a 0.9% gain with a record of twelve advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #2 with an average gain of 1.3% (14-3 record). Election-year June ranks #4 for NASDAQ and Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.6% and 1.4% respectively. This performance improvement is most likely the result of presidential candidate field being sufficiently narrowed, and the ultimate nominees being identified.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a72b7e4acd0417756738dc99296c53d9/b62a78126f7fd2f0-07/s400x600/2f93e5e52a2c425a44e8dd371d8628f5cdc01bdf.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$COST** \n&gt; * **$AZO** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$BNS** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$NIO** \n&gt; * **$RL** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$CBL** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$ESLT** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$HPQ** \n&gt; * **$MOMO** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$HIBB** \n&gt; * **$ZS** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$TD** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$KEYS** \n&gt; * **$NTNX** \n&gt; * **$PLAB** \n&gt; * **$BMO** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$RY** \n&gt; * **$MGIC** \n&gt; * **$BOX** \n&gt; * **$ERJ** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$DELL** \n&gt; * **$CYD** \n&gt; * **$PLT** \n&gt; * **$VIPS** \n&gt; * **$COHR** \n&gt; * **$VIOT** \n&gt; * **$NTAP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Mr8CSMQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vZhPWXr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

The exchange-traded fund that tracks the Dow, which has no curbs, was up just over 5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 582 points or 3.1% on Monday after the Senate failed for a second time in less than 24 hours to advance the stimulus bill. Investors were more concerned about talks on Capitol Hill than encouraged by the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement Monday of an open-ended asset purchase program. As of Monday\u2019s close, the lowest since November 2016, the Dow was down 37% from its record highs last month.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Senate Democrats expressed optimism about reaching a relief deal from the coronavirus crisis after negotiations with Trump administration officials stretched late into the night. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks were set to resume Tuesday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out with House Democrats\u2019 $2.5 trillion bill. Also on Monday, President Donald Trump suggested he wants to urge businesses to reopen, sooner rather than later. \u201cI\u2019m not looking at months,\u201d the president said.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * As Trump considers relaxing some coronavirus restrictions, the U.K. issued a stay-at-home order, starting Tuesday, allowing only essential trips. All nonessential public buildings and places are closed, ranging from libraries to churches, outdoor gyms and playgrounds. All social events including weddings and baptisms are also prohibited. In China, the two-month lockdown of most of Hubei province was lifted. However, Wuhan, the city in the province where the coronavirus originated in December, remains locked down until April 8.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases approached 384,000 with 16,594 deaths and nearly 102,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. China, at about 81,500 cases, has just 21% of the infections around the world as the spread in European nations and the United States continued to spike higher. Italy, the hardest-hit country outside China, saw cases rise to nearly 64,000. The death toll in Italy of 6,077 was nearly double that of China and the highest in the world. Cases in America increased to 46,450 with 593 deaths. Nearly half the U.S. cases and the highest U.S. death toll of 188 were in New York state.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Top U.S. airlines are working on plans for a possible voluntary shutdown of nearly all U.S. passenger flights, industry and federal officials told The Wall Street Journal. The government was also talking about ordering such a move, the Journal said. The carriers and the White House have made no final decisions.Demand for air travel has plummeted as many states have issued formal stay-at-home orders or just encouraged people not to leave their homes. Social-distancing has become the new way of life as the world grapples with containing the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/cfaAWsy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kH00D11.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/SjUA7ht.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($INFO $LX $AEYE $NEOG $TNP $CMCM $VTSI $YJ $QIWI $ECOR $EH $DMAC $PANL $FENG $CANG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XJRjXat.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/OOVZiVo.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/joftHtT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/irtsavz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/AIITRE6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/RlkMxl6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/trFFJU3.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/MxOAol4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/BgKOWeP.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* NVAX\n* ZM\n* NFLX\n* PENN\n* NUGT\n* MAIN\n* IVR\n* SCPH\n* NKE\n* BDTX\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-chevron-twitter-amazon-mondelez-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Chevron (CVX)** \u2013 Chevron plans to cut capital spending plans for 2020 by 20%, and will suspend its share buyback program.

The exchange-traded fund that tracks the Dow, which has no curbs, was up just over 5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 582 points or 3.1% on Monday after the Senate failed for a second time in less than 24 hours to advance the stimulus bill. Investors were more concerned about talks on Capitol Hill than encouraged by the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement Monday of an open-ended asset purchase program. As of Monday\u2019s close, the lowest since November 2016, the Dow was down 37% from its record highs last month.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Senate Democrats expressed optimism about reaching a relief deal from the coronavirus crisis after negotiations with Trump administration officials stretched late into the night. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks were set to resume Tuesday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out with House Democrats\u2019 $2.5 trillion bill. Also on Monday, President Donald Trump suggested he wants to urge businesses to reopen, sooner rather than later. \u201cI\u2019m not looking at months,\u201d the president said.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * As Trump considers relaxing some coronavirus restrictions, the U.K. issued a stay-at-home order, starting Tuesday, allowing only essential trips. All nonessential public buildings and places are closed, ranging from libraries to churches, outdoor gyms and playgrounds. All social events including weddings and baptisms are also prohibited. In China, the two-month lockdown of most of Hubei province was lifted. However, Wuhan, the city in the province where the coronavirus originated in December, remains locked down until April 8.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases approached 384,000 with 16,594 deaths and nearly 102,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. China, at about 81,500 cases, has just 21% of the infections around the world as the spread in European nations and the United States continued to spike higher. Italy, the hardest-hit country outside China, saw cases rise to nearly 64,000. The death toll in Italy of 6,077 was nearly double that of China and the highest in the world. Cases in America increased to 46,450 with 593 deaths. Nearly half the U.S. cases and the highest U.S. death toll of 188 were in New York state.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Top U.S. airlines are working on plans for a possible voluntary shutdown of nearly all U.S. passenger flights, industry and federal officials told The Wall Street Journal. The government was also talking about ordering such a move, the Journal said. The carriers and the White House have made no final decisions.Demand for air travel has plummeted as many states have issued formal stay-at-home orders or just encouraged people not to leave their homes. Social-distancing has become the new way of life as the world grapples with containing the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/cfaAWsy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kH00D11.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/SjUA7ht.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($INFO $LX $AEYE $NEOG $TNP $CMCM $VTSI $YJ $QIWI $ECOR $EH $DMAC $PANL $FENG $CANG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XJRjXat.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/OOVZiVo.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/joftHtT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/irtsavz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/AIITRE6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/RlkMxl6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/trFFJU3.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/MxOAol4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/BgKOWeP.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* NVAX\n* ZM\n* NFLX\n* PENN\n* NUGT\n* MAIN\n* IVR\n* SCPH\n* NKE\n* BDTX\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-chevron-twitter-amazon-mondelez-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Chevron (CVX)** \u2013 Chevron plans to cut capital spending plans for 2020 by 20%, and will suspend its share buyback program.

However, stocks might still be searching for a bottom next week when investors grapple with a slew of economic data potentially dragged down by the outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing gauge on Monday. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will publish its latest Beige Book on Wednesday, which will detail anecdotal information on current economic conditions. Many expect U.S. manufacturing to have taken a hit from the coronavirus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLook out for ISM surveys and Beige Book for early signs of COVID-19 impact,\u201d Michelle Meyer, Bank of America\u2019s head of U.S. economics, said in a note Friday. \u201cIt will take time for the \u2018hard\u2019 economic data to show the impact but we are already seeing evidence in early economic indicators.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Weekend action?\n&gt; The outlook for the week could be changed this weekend by coronavirus headlines or by some sort of intervention by central banks. Expectations are rising on Wall Street that there could be some potential move from the Federal Reserve to get ahead of what could be another rough week.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank is monitoring the coronavirus and pledged action if necessary. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh recommended the Fed act as quickly as Sunday before the markets reopen. The market is already pricing in a 100% chance of at least one rate cut at the Fed\u2019s March policy meeting.\n*****\n&gt; Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, is worried about the cascading effect of coronavirus hitting upcoming economic data points. \u201cISM manufacturing is going to be widely scrutinized,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The ISM manufacturing index rose to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July (Any reading above 50 signals expansion.) Bank of America expects ISM manufacturing to pull back to 50.0 and said Fed Beige Book may provide \u201cearly insight\u201d into the U.S. economic impact from the deadly virus.\n*****\n&gt; Cutting forecasts\n&gt; Next week, investors will also likely grapple with more warnings from major companies about broken supply chains and easing demand due to the outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Nike and United Airlines have all sounded alarms that they will not meet their earnings and revenue guidance because of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Wall Street strategists this week were quick to slash their forecasts on corporate earnings and the stock market. Barclays sees the S&amp;P 500 to end the year at 3,000, down from a previous forecast of 3,300. The bank also expects a 2% drop in profits this year. Meanwhile, Goldman said it sees zero earnings growth for American companies in 2020.\n*****\n&gt; To be sure, some believe the steep stock rout has gone too far too fast, betting on at least a small rebound.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe level of panic has become very extreme and the level of downside price movement is pretty extreme. All of that is to me more of a sign that we are getting closer to the beginning of the end of it,\u201d Paulsen said.\n*****\n&gt; Another source of support could come from the Trump administration, where officials are discussing tax cuts, among other economic reactions, as one option to make up for the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Washington Post reported Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Still, investors will have to be on edge for a while now with more virus headlines, as well as the key Super Tuesday Democratic primaries. Some notable investors including \u201cbond king\u201d Jeffrey Gundlach blamed the rise of Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders for helping accelerate massive sell-off.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xxV96kn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3XfCFrl.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/zbhTBQr.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zASmUSl.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wv7Xef1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qPOD5uN.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2z1n5iA.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jgqhUBR.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j7kavSk.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4awCCsW.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ElXoU2T.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xH2GYRk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/HyXxrSJ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/GIw7Oq6.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gauging Potential Economic Impact of Covid-19\n\n&gt; The coronavirus outbreak\u2014or Covid-19 \u2014has caused significant market volatility over the past week. Our approach as always is to focus on economic fundamentals first, but the uncertainty around the scope of the outbreak has made it very difficult to assess potential impact. The situation clearly is unsettling for investors as more cases are reported across Europe and Asia, and the first case of community transmission has been reported in the United States. As this was written, the S&amp;P 500 Index was 10% below its February 19 all-time high.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe Covid-19 outbreak continues to significantly disrupt economic activity in China and throughout Asia,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cGiven that China is such a big component of many global supply chains, we will almost certainly see weaker economic data globally over the next several months.\u201d\n\n&gt; Even as the situation remains fluid and very uncertain, we want to provide some sense of the potential U.S. and global economic impact.\n\n&gt; **China**: If virus containment holds in China, which is our base case, we could see something like a 3\u20134 percentage point impact to Chinese economic growth in the first quarter\u2014possibly 2\u20133% gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than 5\u20136%\u2014followed by a much more modest hit in the second quarter. We think we would see a return to trend growth by the third quarter of 2020. This scenario would put China\u2019s 2020 GDP growth below the current 5.6% Bloomberg-tracked consensus, shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, and the Chinese government\u2019s previous 6% annual target. In other words, China\u2019s GDP growth in 2020 could end up closer to 5% than 6%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; United States: At this point, our base case is that any economic disruption in the United States may be modest and short-lived, as we expect domestic efforts at containment to be more successful and have less economic disruption than in China. The outbreak may trim 0.25\u20130.5% from U.S. GDP over the next couple of months due to global supply chain disruption, falling export demand, and decreased tourism. If evidence emerges over the next month or so that the virus is being contained successfully, as we expect, the economic impact would likely be at the better end of that range (0.25%). In that scenario, damage to business and consumer confidence would be limited, setting the stage for a potential second-quarter rebound. We believe our 1.75% U.S. GDP growth forecast may still be achievable.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; **Global**: In the short-term, the collective hits to global GDP from China, South Korea, Japan, and Italy\u2014the countries where the outbreak impact has been greatest to date\u2014may comprise 0.2\u20130.3% of global GDP. Our latest global GDP forecast of 3.5% from our Outlook 2020 publication is probably a bit too high in light of the latest news. We expect to update or reaffirm our economic forecasts once we have more clarity around Covid-19 impact in the weeks ahead.\n\n*****\n\n# Can the Market Bottom on a Friday?\n\n&gt; It's often said that equity markets can't bottom on a Friday. One of the reasons for this line of thinking is that during a market downturn, no one wants to hold onto or bid up equities into a weekend for fear of further bad news. It may just be a matter of semantics, but based on that line of reasoning, the more accurate way to phrase it would be that markets can't bottom on a Thursday or rallies can't begin on a Friday. However you want to think about it, the chart below shows the number of times the closing low of a 10%+ correction has occurred on various weekdays.\n\n&gt; Of the 97 S&amp;P 500 corrections since 1928, the day of the week that has marked the low close of a 10%+ decline the least frequently is actually Wednesday with only 10. Behind Wednesday, Friday has been the second most infrequent day of the week for a bottom (15), and Thursday is the only other day of the week where the S&amp;P 500 has made a low on a closing basis less than 20 times. The days of the week where the S&amp;P 500 most frequently bottoms are Monday and Tuesday with 26 and 28, respectively.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-10-Corrections.png))**\n\n&gt; Regarding bear markets (20%+ declines), the trend is very similar. Bear markets have been the least likely to end on a Wednesday or Friday and most likely to end on a Tuesday.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-Bear-Markets.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dividend Stock Spotlight: S&amp;P 500's Highest Yielders From The Sell-Off\n\n&gt; Given the lower prices of stocks, dividend yields have been on the rise over the past couple of weeks. The dividend yield of the S&amp;P 500 now stands at 2.12% which is the highest since June 3rd of last year when it reached the same level, but only stayed there for a single day. Prior to that, yields were only higher during the Q4 2018 sell-off through February of 2019. At the beginning of the current sell-off on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500's yield was 26 bps lower at 1.86%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Div-yield-sp.png))**\n\n&gt; Of the individual stocks in the index, there are now 81 stocks that have dividend yields of 4% or more. That compares to only 64 at the beginning of the sell-off. In the table below, we show the 25 highest yielders of the S&amp;P 500 as well as the price change and change in the dividend yield since the 2/19 record high. As shown, there is only one stock, Macy's (M), that yields over 10% at the moment. This major retailer has fallen out of favor in the past few years but the stock has gotten crushed since the 2/19 market peak having fallen just under 21% in that time. That decline has raised the dividend yield by 2.44 percentage points, but there is one other stock that has seen its yield increase by even more. That stock is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the second-highest yielder in the index (9.93%). Being an Energy name, OXY has fallen the most dramatically (-29.05%) since 2/19 of all the highest yielders.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Highest-Yielding-table1.png))**\n\n&gt; While there is a lot of overlap, in the table below we show the stocks that have seen their dividend yields rise the most as stocks have declined since 2/19. Again OXY and M top the list. While no other stocks have seen their dividend yields increase by more than 2 percentage points, there are another 17 who have risen by at least 1 percentage point. Notably, two cruise line stocks, Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) find themselves on this list. Carnival (CCL) now yields 6.28% while Royal Caribbean (RCL) yields 4.05%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Biggest-Change-yield-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Biggest Losers (and a few winners)\n\n&gt; It is no secret that energy stocks have gotten crushed this year, and the list of the 25 worst-performing stocks in the Russell 1000 since the previous record close on February 19th is a prime example of this. Seven energy stocks find themselves on this list, two of which, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Kosmos Energy (KOS), take up the number one and two spots having fallen 45.73% and 41.95%, respectively since 2/19. CHK had already been weak headed into the broader market sell-off with a YTD loss on 2/19 over 40%; the past week has added fuel to the fire as it is now down 68.5% YTD. Continental (CLR), Centennial Resource Development (CDEV), Transocean (RIG), and Apergy (APY) are other energy stocks that were down 20% or more on the year headed into this sell-off, and each one has fallen another 20%+ since the 19th. While most of the other biggest losers since 2/19 had already been down on the year, there are some that have seen their gains in 2020 get erased due to this sell-off like Nutanix (NTNX), Qurate Retail (QRTEA), Anaplan (PLAN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Chemours (CC), and CommScope (COMM). Some other notable losers of this group have been those heavily reliant on travel like American Airlines (AAL) and the cruise line stocks like Norwegian (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Worst.png))**\n\n&gt; Given how breadth has been over the past week, it may not come as any surprise that since the February 19th high there are only 18 stocks of 1000 in the Russell 1000 index that are higher. Four of those are up less than one percent. In the table below we show all of these stocks. Given the sell-off has centered around coronavirus fears, it is sensical that a coronavirus vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) is the best performing stock since 2/19. What is amazing is there was not much momentum with this name headed into the sell-off. As of 2/19, the stock was actually down 3.27% year to date, but as the Covid-19 saga has moved along it is now up well north of 30% on the year. A few other health care names like Regeneron (REGN) and Gilead (GILD) have also benefited from the coronavirus.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Best.png))**\n\n&gt; The histogram below shows the distribution of performance of Russell 1000 stocks since 2/19. As mentioned above, there are very few stocks in the index that are up since the 2/19 high. The highest share of stocks are down between 10% and 15% while the next highest share are down between 5% and 10%. Of the worst decliners, there are 75 stocks that have fallen over 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/hist.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at the individual sectors, again Energy was extremely weak even before equities sold off. On 2/19, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1000 in that sector was down 15.6% YTD. While they hadn't tipped into the red yet, Consumer Staples were only up 1 bp.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/YTD-of-219.png))**\n\n&gt; Since the 2/19 high for the US equity market, the average stock in the Russell 1,000 is down well over 10%. The average Energy stock is down the most at -21%, followed by Communication Services and Technology at -13%. Consumer Staples stocks have performed the best with an average decline of 8.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Since-219.png))**\n\n&gt; This leaves every sector down year-to-date. Utilities have generally outperformed only falling 2.3%, but the sector is sitting on a loss nonetheless. Of the worst sectors, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, and of course Energy have fallen 10% or more.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RIY-CYTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equity Benchmarks Distance From YTD Highs\n\n&gt; The recent equity sell-off has clearly been global in nature as concerns of a global pandemic rise. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the way equities have sold off recently is that the country that has been hardest hit by the virus is closer to its YTD high than any other major global equity benchmark. The chart below shows the distance that each major global equity benchmark has declined relative to its YTD high. China's Shanghai Composite is down just 4.45%, which is better than any other country shown. Sure, you could argue that the Chinese government is manipulating the market and prohibiting investors from selling, but even the ETF that tracks the CSI 300 (ASHR) is down less than 6%, so anyone could go in and trade at these levels. Manipulated or not, the numbers are the numbers.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the list, Brazil's Ibovespa index is down more than any other country at 11.6% and that country has only reported one confirmed case so far. With respect to US indices, the Russell 2000 is down the second most of any major global benchmark (-9.19%), while the Nasdaq is down the fourth most at 8.68%. Even the S&amp;P 500 is down close to 8%. These weak US readings come in a backdrop where there have only been 57 confirmed cases and all but a couple are instances where Americans contracted the virus outside of the United States and have been brought to the US under quarantine.

Since WWII, there have only been four other weeks where the S&amp;P 500 was down more than 10% in a given week. On a related note, there are also only four stocks in the entire S&amp;P 500 that are positive for the week! Leading the way higher, Regeneron (REGN) is up a healthy 7.1% while Gilead (GILD) is up just over 4%. Behind these two, the only other stocks that are higher now than they were at last Friday's close are Clorox (CLX) and CME Group (CME).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Gainers.png))**\n\n&gt; On the downside, there are a lot more losers, but in the interest of space, below we have only listed the 17 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 20% this week alone. Looking through the names on the list, the cruise lines are well represented with Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Besides these names, American Airlines (AAL) is down 26%, while Live Nation (LYV) is down 22.2%.\n\n&gt; One thing we've heard a number of people argue the last few days is that some of the weakness this week is related to the increasing likelihood that Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. If that's the case, why is not a single one of the worst-performing stocks from the Health Care sector, and why is the Health Care sector the third best performing sector this week and one of just four that is not down 10% so far this week?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Decliners.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$TGT** \n&gt; * **$PLUG** \n&gt; * **$JD** \n&gt; * **$ZM** \n&gt; * **$COST** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$AZO** \n&gt; * **$KSS** \n&gt; * **$SPLK** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$XRAY** \n&gt; * **$SE** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$FOLD** \n&gt; * **$KR** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$STNE** \n&gt; * **$BLDP** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$CIEN** \n&gt; * **$ALBO** \n&gt; * **$MAXR** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$ITCI** \n&gt; * **$FNKO** \n&gt; * **$JWN** \n&gt; * **$EPRT** \n&gt; * **$VIPS** \n&gt; * **$GTT** \n&gt; * **$CORE** \n&gt; * **$BNFT** \n&gt; * **$LVGO** \n&gt; * **$EVRG** \n&gt; * **$ROST** \n&gt; * **$EGRX** \n&gt; * **$AOBC** \n&gt; * **$TGLS** \n&gt; * **$ATRS** \n&gt; * **$HPE** \n&gt; * **$NWN** \n&gt; * **$WVE** \n&gt; * **$WSC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/j7kavSk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/x29nduD.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WpXhdqA.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ycdhPpa.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.3.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VIBwP3J.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0CU1CX3.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BCVHMu2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6EsJdZf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3YUYSb9.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M3Hifok.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.6.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0W1FLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.6.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n# Target Corp. $103.00\n&gt; **Target Corp.

However, stocks might still be searching for a bottom next week when investors grapple with a slew of economic data potentially dragged down by the outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing gauge on Monday.

Expectations are rising on Wall Street that there could be some potential move from the Federal Reserve to get ahead of what could be another rough week.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank is monitoring the coronavirus and pledged action if necessary. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh recommended the Fed act as quickly as Sunday before the markets reopen. The market is already pricing in a 100% chance of at least one rate cut at the Fed\u2019s March policy meeting.\n*****\n&gt; Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, is worried about the cascading effect of coronavirus hitting upcoming economic data points. \u201cISM manufacturing is going to be widely scrutinized,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The ISM manufacturing index rose to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July (Any reading above 50 signals expansion.) Bank of America expects ISM manufacturing to pull back to 50.0 and said Fed Beige Book may provide \u201cearly insight\u201d into the U.S. economic impact from the deadly virus.\n*****\n&gt; Cutting forecasts\n&gt; Next week, investors will also likely grapple with more warnings from major companies about broken supply chains and easing demand due to the outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Nike and United Airlines have all sounded alarms that they will not meet their earnings and revenue guidance because of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Wall Street strategists this week were quick to slash their forecasts on corporate earnings and the stock market. Barclays sees the S&amp;P 500 to end the year at 3,000, down from a previous forecast of 3,300. The bank also expects a 2% drop in profits this year. Meanwhile, Goldman said it sees zero earnings growth for American companies in 2020.\n*****\n&gt; To be sure, some believe the steep stock rout has gone too far too fast, betting on at least a small rebound.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe level of panic has become very extreme and the level of downside price movement is pretty extreme. All of that is to me more of a sign that we are getting closer to the beginning of the end of it,\u201d Paulsen said.\n*****\n&gt; Another source of support could come from the Trump administration, where officials are discussing tax cuts, among other economic reactions, as one option to make up for the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Washington Post reported Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Still, investors will have to be on edge for a while now with more virus headlines, as well as the key Super Tuesday Democratic primaries. Some notable investors including \u201cbond king\u201d Jeffrey Gundlach blamed the rise of Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders for helping accelerate massive sell-off.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xxV96kn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3XfCFrl.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/zbhTBQr.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zASmUSl.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wv7Xef1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qPOD5uN.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2z1n5iA.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jgqhUBR.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j7kavSk.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4awCCsW.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ElXoU2T.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xH2GYRk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/HyXxrSJ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/GIw7Oq6.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gauging Potential Economic Impact of Covid-19\n\n&gt; The coronavirus outbreak\u2014or Covid-19 \u2014has caused significant market volatility over the past week. Our approach as always is to focus on economic fundamentals first, but the uncertainty around the scope of the outbreak has made it very difficult to assess potential impact. The situation clearly is unsettling for investors as more cases are reported across Europe and Asia, and the first case of community transmission has been reported in the United States. As this was written, the S&amp;P 500 Index was 10% below its February 19 all-time high.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe Covid-19 outbreak continues to significantly disrupt economic activity in China and throughout Asia,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cGiven that China is such a big component of many global supply chains, we will almost certainly see weaker economic data globally over the next several months.\u201d\n\n&gt; Even as the situation remains fluid and very uncertain, we want to provide some sense of the potential U.S. and global economic impact.\n\n&gt; **China**: If virus containment holds in China, which is our base case, we could see something like a 3\u20134 percentage point impact to Chinese economic growth in the first quarter\u2014possibly 2\u20133% gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than 5\u20136%\u2014followed by a much more modest hit in the second quarter. We think we would see a return to trend growth by the third quarter of 2020. This scenario would put China\u2019s 2020 GDP growth below the current 5.6% Bloomberg-tracked consensus, shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, and the Chinese government\u2019s previous 6% annual target. In other words, China\u2019s GDP growth in 2020 could end up closer to 5% than 6%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; United States: At this point, our base case is that any economic disruption in the United States may be modest and short-lived, as we expect domestic efforts at containment to be more successful and have less economic disruption than in China. The outbreak may trim 0.25\u20130.5% from U.S. GDP over the next couple of months due to global supply chain disruption, falling export demand, and decreased tourism. If evidence emerges over the next month or so that the virus is being contained successfully, as we expect, the economic impact would likely be at the better end of that range (0.25%). In that scenario, damage to business and consumer confidence would be limited, setting the stage for a potential second-quarter rebound. We believe our 1.75% U.S. GDP growth forecast may still be achievable.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; **Global**: In the short-term, the collective hits to global GDP from China, South Korea, Japan, and Italy\u2014the countries where the outbreak impact has been greatest to date\u2014may comprise 0.2\u20130.3% of global GDP. Our latest global GDP forecast of 3.5% from our Outlook 2020 publication is probably a bit too high in light of the latest news. We expect to update or reaffirm our economic forecasts once we have more clarity around Covid-19 impact in the weeks ahead.\n\n*****\n\n# Can the Market Bottom on a Friday?\n\n&gt; It's often said that equity markets can't bottom on a Friday. One of the reasons for this line of thinking is that during a market downturn, no one wants to hold onto or bid up equities into a weekend for fear of further bad news. It may just be a matter of semantics, but based on that line of reasoning, the more accurate way to phrase it would be that markets can't bottom on a Thursday or rallies can't begin on a Friday. However you want to think about it, the chart below shows the number of times the closing low of a 10%+ correction has occurred on various weekdays.\n\n&gt; Of the 97 S&amp;P 500 corrections since 1928, the day of the week that has marked the low close of a 10%+ decline the least frequently is actually Wednesday with only 10. Behind Wednesday, Friday has been the second most infrequent day of the week for a bottom (15), and Thursday is the only other day of the week where the S&amp;P 500 has made a low on a closing basis less than 20 times. The days of the week where the S&amp;P 500 most frequently bottoms are Monday and Tuesday with 26 and 28, respectively.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-10-Corrections.png))**\n\n&gt; Regarding bear markets (20%+ declines), the trend is very similar. Bear markets have been the least likely to end on a Wednesday or Friday and most likely to end on a Tuesday.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-Bear-Markets.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dividend Stock Spotlight: S&amp;P 500's Highest Yielders From The Sell-Off\n\n&gt; Given the lower prices of stocks, dividend yields have been on the rise over the past couple of weeks. The dividend yield of the S&amp;P 500 now stands at 2.12% which is the highest since June 3rd of last year when it reached the same level, but only stayed there for a single day. Prior to that, yields were only higher during the Q4 2018 sell-off through February of 2019. At the beginning of the current sell-off on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500's yield was 26 bps lower at 1.86%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Div-yield-sp.png))**\n\n&gt; Of the individual stocks in the index, there are now 81 stocks that have dividend yields of 4% or more. That compares to only 64 at the beginning of the sell-off. In the table below, we show the 25 highest yielders of the S&amp;P 500 as well as the price change and change in the dividend yield since the 2/19 record high. As shown, there is only one stock, Macy's (M), that yields over 10% at the moment. This major retailer has fallen out of favor in the past few years but the stock has gotten crushed since the 2/19 market peak having fallen just under 21% in that time. That decline has raised the dividend yield by 2.44 percentage points, but there is one other stock that has seen its yield increase by even more. That stock is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the second-highest yielder in the index (9.93%). Being an Energy name, OXY has fallen the most dramatically (-29.05%) since 2/19 of all the highest yielders.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Highest-Yielding-table1.png))**\n\n&gt; While there is a lot of overlap, in the table below we show the stocks that have seen their dividend yields rise the most as stocks have declined since 2/19. Again OXY and M top the list. While no other stocks have seen their dividend yields increase by more than 2 percentage points, there are another 17 who have risen by at least 1 percentage point. Notably, two cruise line stocks, Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) find themselves on this list. Carnival (CCL) now yields 6.28% while Royal Caribbean (RCL) yields 4.05%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Biggest-Change-yield-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Biggest Losers (and a few winners)\n\n&gt; It is no secret that energy stocks have gotten crushed this year, and the list of the 25 worst-performing stocks in the Russell 1000 since the previous record close on February 19th is a prime example of this. Seven energy stocks find themselves on this list, two of which, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Kosmos Energy (KOS), take up the number one and two spots having fallen 45.73% and 41.95%, respectively since 2/19. CHK had already been weak headed into the broader market sell-off with a YTD loss on 2/19 over 40%; the past week has added fuel to the fire as it is now down 68.5% YTD. Continental (CLR), Centennial Resource Development (CDEV), Transocean (RIG), and Apergy (APY) are other energy stocks that were down 20% or more on the year headed into this sell-off, and each one has fallen another 20%+ since the 19th. While most of the other biggest losers since 2/19 had already been down on the year, there are some that have seen their gains in 2020 get erased due to this sell-off like Nutanix (NTNX), Qurate Retail (QRTEA), Anaplan (PLAN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Chemours (CC), and CommScope (COMM). Some other notable losers of this group have been those heavily reliant on travel like American Airlines (AAL) and the cruise line stocks like Norwegian (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Worst.png))**\n\n&gt; Given how breadth has been over the past week, it may not come as any surprise that since the February 19th high there are only 18 stocks of 1000 in the Russell 1000 index that are higher. Four of those are up less than one percent. In the table below we show all of these stocks. Given the sell-off has centered around coronavirus fears, it is sensical that a coronavirus vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) is the best performing stock since 2/19. What is amazing is there was not much momentum with this name headed into the sell-off. As of 2/19, the stock was actually down 3.27% year to date, but as the Covid-19 saga has moved along it is now up well north of 30% on the year. A few other health care names like Regeneron (REGN) and Gilead (GILD) have also benefited from the coronavirus.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Best.png))**\n\n&gt; The histogram below shows the distribution of performance of Russell 1000 stocks since 2/19. As mentioned above, there are very few stocks in the index that are up since the 2/19 high. The highest share of stocks are down between 10% and 15% while the next highest share are down between 5% and 10%. Of the worst decliners, there are 75 stocks that have fallen over 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/hist.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at the individual sectors, again Energy was extremely weak even before equities sold off. On 2/19, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1000 in that sector was down 15.6% YTD. While they hadn't tipped into the red yet, Consumer Staples were only up 1 bp.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/YTD-of-219.png))**\n\n&gt; Since the 2/19 high for the US equity market, the average stock in the Russell 1,000 is down well over 10%. The average Energy stock is down the most at -21%, followed by Communication Services and Technology at -13%. Consumer Staples stocks have performed the best with an average decline of 8.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Since-219.png))**\n\n&gt; This leaves every sector down year-to-date. Utilities have generally outperformed only falling 2.3%, but the sector is sitting on a loss nonetheless. Of the worst sectors, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, and of course Energy have fallen 10% or more.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RIY-CYTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equity Benchmarks Distance From YTD Highs\n\n&gt; The recent equity sell-off has clearly been global in nature as concerns of a global pandemic rise. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the way equities have sold off recently is that the country that has been hardest hit by the virus is closer to its YTD high than any other major global equity benchmark. The chart below shows the distance that each major global equity benchmark has declined relative to its YTD high. China's Shanghai Composite is down just 4.45%, which is better than any other country shown. Sure, you could argue that the Chinese government is manipulating the market and prohibiting investors from selling, but even the ETF that tracks the CSI 300 (ASHR) is down less than 6%, so anyone could go in and trade at these levels. Manipulated or not, the numbers are the numbers.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the list, Brazil's Ibovespa index is down more than any other country at 11.6% and that country has only reported one confirmed case so far. With respect to US indices, the Russell 2000 is down the second most of any major global benchmark (-9.19%), while the Nasdaq is down the fourth most at 8.68%. Even the S&amp;P 500 is down close to 8%. These weak US readings come in a backdrop where there have only been 57 confirmed cases and all but a couple are instances where Americans contracted the virus outside of the United States and have been brought to the US under quarantine.

Since WWII, there have only been four other weeks where the S&amp;P 500 was down more than 10% in a given week. On a related note, there are also only four stocks in the entire S&amp;P 500 that are positive for the week! Leading the way higher, Regeneron (REGN) is up a healthy 7.1% while Gilead (GILD) is up just over 4%. Behind these two, the only other stocks that are higher now than they were at last Friday's close are Clorox (CLX) and CME Group (CME).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Gainers.png))**\n\n&gt; On the downside, there are a lot more losers, but in the interest of space, below we have only listed the 17 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 20% this week alone. Looking through the names on the list, the cruise lines are well represented with Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Besides these names, American Airlines (AAL) is down 26%, while Live Nation (LYV) is down 22.2%.\n\n&gt; One thing we've heard a number of people argue the last few days is that some of the weakness this week is related to the increasing likelihood that Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. If that's the case, why is not a single one of the worst-performing stocks from the Health Care sector, and why is the Health Care sector the third best performing sector this week and one of just four that is not down 10% so far this week?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Decliners.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$TGT** \n&gt; * **$PLUG** \n&gt; * **$JD** \n&gt; * **$ZM** \n&gt; * **$COST** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$AZO** \n&gt; * **$KSS** \n&gt; * **$SPLK** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$XRAY** \n&gt; * **$SE** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$FOLD** \n&gt; * **$KR** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$STNE** \n&gt; * **$BLDP** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$CIEN** \n&gt; * **$ALBO** \n&gt; * **$MAXR** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$ITCI** \n&gt; * **$FNKO** \n&gt; * **$JWN** \n&gt; * **$EPRT** \n&gt; * **$VIPS** \n&gt; * **$GTT** \n&gt; * **$CORE** \n&gt; * **$BNFT** \n&gt; * **$LVGO** \n&gt; * **$EVRG** \n&gt; * **$ROST** \n&gt; * **$EGRX** \n&gt; * **$AOBC** \n&gt; * **$TGLS** \n&gt; * **$ATRS** \n&gt; * **$HPE** \n&gt; * **$NWN** \n&gt; * **$WVE** \n&gt; * **$WSC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/j7kavSk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/x29nduD.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WpXhdqA.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ycdhPpa.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.3.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VIBwP3J.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0CU1CX3.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BCVHMu2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6EsJdZf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3YUYSb9.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M3Hifok.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.6.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0W1FLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.6.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n# Target Corp. $103.00\n&gt; **Target Corp.
