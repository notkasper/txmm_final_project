So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PzNKCYh) leading the way up almost 1,3%, finishing at a new record high, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/syB7wP4) also up over 1,1% and finishing at a new record high, while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/HggpWGF) had smaller gains but was still up to intraday records before finishing over +0,6% for the day. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SDCq7vf) rose for the day after opening at 20,2 and as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/0n1TDKt) big gains were led by the FAANG stocks with Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix gaining over 2% for the day while Amazon and Microsoft also were up at least 1%. This pulled the big indexes higher as they account for a big part of them.\n\nOver 60% of companies were advancing on average volume while companies moving above important moving averages continued to climb as we are going into a very risky market, as to many companies are trading high at the moment and are due for a correction. [CHART](https://ibb.co/DfgJ12R)\n\nThe biggest gaining [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/T8NPW6W) yesterday were Communications, Financials and Technology with most sectors being in the green, except industrial, as the laggards from yesterday were small cap growth companies and especially those from CHINA, like NIO, Alibaba and others, that have suffered from the recent news that the US is looking to delist some of them if they do not meet new standards. [CHART](https://ibb.co/gmpRVWW)\n\nHere are the most interesting economic events and data for [TODAY](https://ibb.co/cyp7x5W), as we will see how Mortgage Applications and ADP Jobs are going. Afterwards a couple of FED leaders will speak before we can take a look at how the Petroleum Inventories are going.\n\nWhile [GREAT NEWS](https://ibb.co/1d6y1yh) started to pop in the early morning as the UK has become the first country to authorize the Pfizer vaccine for use.\n\nThis news are already baked in the market in my opinion as investors were already expecting this to happen sooner rather than later, but this are still very good news to hear, as a confirmation is still great to have, rather than just expectations. I expect the US will soon follow in the next 10-14 days to approve both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine, that might just have a bigger impact on the stock market, but I would be careful until then, as we might get a correction in the stock market after this huge rally before we can move on even higher, as I fully expect this bull market to continue into 2021 and 2022.\n\nWell yesterday, as I expected Nikola [tumbled again](https://ibb.co/2hzPCJL) after the insider lockup period expired, as only the possibility of Milton selling his shares has spooked the market after an already bad day with the GM deal disappointing investors. As the original deal is null and void with GM not taking any stake in Nikola or helping with the engineering or manufacturing of the Badger pickup truck. The only good thing in sight for the company is the possible hydrogen fueling station network partnership by year end as announced by the management. I maintain my sell opinion on this stock as I predicted a 15-16$ in the future when the stock was trading over 20, I think it has more room to go down, it might go to single digits in the long run, as the company has become very shady after the fiasco with the misleading tactics and no breaking new fuel cell technology.\n\nOn the other hand, Salesforce crushed [earnings](https://ibb.co/XCzz5Mz) expectations, as they beat the EPS by almost 1$ and had a revenue beat of over 160 million$. They also raised [guidance](https://ibb.co/JRf2G3j) for both revenue and EPS for next year way above the consensus while also maintaining cash and equivalents at over $9B, up 45% for the year.\n\nThe company also officially [announced](https://ibb.co/whYVfzC) the acquiring of Slack in a deal worth almost $28B. This will result in the Slack software being incorporated in every aspect of Salesforce cloud offering. This 2 will be the biggest competitors yet for Microsoft. So, I believe after the dust settles, and CRM stock finally gets back on track, we will have a good long term growth opportunity with Salesforce.\n\nSlack also reported earnings yesterday after the bell as the company [posted](https://ibb.co/N6Qnw7M) a beat of estimates and an increase in paid customers and billings.\n\nWe also got some [numbers](https://ibb.co/6rNGCnZ) from Cyber Monday sales as the spending increase over 15% but, this was not enough to meet all the estimates as holiday shopping has been probably spread through the whole month of November and will continue to go strong in December in my opinion.\n\nWhile on the economic front news were not so great as the [November ISM](https://ibb.co/3yM4Hwc) index fell shy of expectations with light vehicles [sales](https://ibb.co/PG09TRf) dropping by almost 1 million from last month and are way below the year ago period.\n\nBut we did see some big improvements in [construction spending](https://ibb.co/cc5z2wq), as the numbers came in about half a % better than consensus and are up 3,7% year over year while the [November PMI](https://ibb.co/6JzRnJ1) index saw the biggest improvement in over 6 years.\n\nThe biggest earnings that will be released today will be from [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/RvSk8SJ) and [Okta](https://ibb.co/RDrYy8K), as I expect both of them to turn out a positive EPS, as we might see some momentum in this stocks if they don\u2019t disappoint.\n\nI greatly expect the [IPO](https://ibb.co/pKzxhmK) of AirBNB, as this could become a company that will benefit a lot from the reopening of the world in the next year or two.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

The market is on track to post its first negative month since March.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average last traded up 260 points, or 0.9%, after jumping 550 points at its session high. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7%.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin struck an optimistic tone about reaching a coronavirus aid deal on Wednesday after the stalemate in Washington dragged on for weeks.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI say we\u2019re going to give it one more serious try to get this done and I think we\u2019re hopeful that we can get something done,\u201d Mnuchin said at the Delivering Alpha conference presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor. \u201cI think there is a reasonable compromise here.\u201d\n\nHowever, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday afternoon that Republicans and Democrats are still \u201cfar apart\u201d on a relief deal. Stocks pared gains after his comments.\n\nThe advance also came on the back of better-than-expected economic data.\u00a0[ADP\u2019s monthly private-sector jobs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/adp-private-sector-jobs-september-2020.html) count showed growth of 749,000 in September, ahead of the 600,000 expected from a Dow Jones economist survey. Meanwhile, [pending home sales](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/august-pending-home-sales-soar-to-a-record-high.html) soared 8.8% in August, marking its highest pace on record, according to the National Association of Realtors survey.\n\nStocks sensitive to the economic recovery, including airlines, banks and cruise operators, led the market rally on Wednesday. Shares of American Airlines and United climbed more than 2.5% each, while Boeing also rose 2.1%. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup all gained at least 1%. Norwegian Cruise popped more than 5%.\n\nStill, major averages are headed for their first monthly declines since March. The S&amp;P 500 is down more than 3% this month, on pace for its first down month in six. The Dow and the Nasdaq Composite have fallen 2.3% and 4.7%, respectively, in September.\n\n## Vicious first debate\n\nInvestors digested the first debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden Tuesday evening, which turned out to be particularly vicious with constant interruptions and insults. Wall Street remained concerned that it will be a drawn-out electoral process that could hit the market.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was a long night and there\u2019s a lot that needs to be sorted out,\u201d said Daniel Deming,\u00a0managing director at KKM Financial. \u201cIt became pretty apparent that this thing is not going to be over on Nov. 3 and I think the market is probably not too crazy about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe short-term volatility pressures probably won\u2019t abate anytime soon after this debate. In a sense, it\u2019s creating even more uncertainty,\u201d Deming said.\u00a0\n\nTrump and Biden\u00a0[sparred on a number of issues](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/presidential-debate-2020-live-updates-trump-biden.html), including their qualifications to manage the U.S. economy, the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, as well as the U.S.\u2032 handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMany market strategists have cited uncertainty around the election as a key headwind for the market before year-end with each outcome bringing its own risks and benefits. Some investors have raised concerns about a potential Biden win as they fear it could lead to higher corporate taxes and tighter regulations. But at the same time, it could ease concerns about the trade war and lack of stimulus to bolster the economy in the wake of the coronavirus.\n\nInvestors are also worried about the potential that the Nov. 3 result is too close to call\u00a0and neither candidate concedes. That uncertainty could particularly weigh on the market.\n\nTrump\u00a0frequently claims that mail-in balloting leads to voter fraud even though experts have repeatedly said there\u2019s no proof of that ever having been a problem in the United States.\u00a0Last week the director of the FBI told a Senate committee that [there\u2019s no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the United States](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/24/fbi-has-not-seen-evidence-of-widespread-voter-fraud-director-wray-tells-senators.html) \u201cwhether it\u2019s by mail or otherwise.\u201d\n\nRegardless, on Tuesday night Trump said, \u201cAs far as the ballots are concerned, it\u2019s a disaster.

Wall Street remained concerned that it will be a drawn-out electoral process that could hit the market.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was a long night and there\u2019s a lot that needs to be sorted out,\u201d said Daniel Deming,\u00a0managing director at KKM Financial. \u201cIt became pretty apparent that this thing is not going to be over on Nov. 3 and I think the market is probably not too crazy about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe short-term volatility pressures probably won\u2019t abate anytime soon after this debate.

Some investors have raised concerns about a potential Biden win as they fear it could lead to higher corporate taxes and tighter regulations. But at the same time, it could ease concerns about the trade war and lack of stimulus to bolster the economy in the wake of the coronavirus.\n\nInvestors are also worried about the potential that the Nov. 3 result is too close to call\u00a0and neither candidate concedes. That uncertainty could particularly weigh on the market.\n\nTrump\u00a0frequently claims that mail-in balloting leads to voter fraud even though experts have repeatedly said there\u2019s no proof of that ever having been a problem in the United States.\u00a0Last week the director of the FBI told a Senate committee that [there\u2019s no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the United States](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/24/fbi-has-not-seen-evidence-of-widespread-voter-fraud-director-wray-tells-senators.html) \u201cwhether it\u2019s by mail or otherwise.\u201d\n\nRegardless, on Tuesday night Trump said, \u201cAs far as the ballots are concerned, it\u2019s a disaster.

Also pointed out that Biden needs to highlight his ability to withstand pressure from some in the Democratic party to push aggressively to the left. Biden expected to focus on Trump's handling of the coronavirus and the broader healthcare issue. Trump expected to focus on his handling of the economy before the pandemic and the success he has had in shaping the courts.

Trump said he wants governors to focus on vulnerable communities like nursing homes and assisted living facilities, along with the resumption of in-person instruction in schools. Admiral Brett Giroir, the administration's coronavirus testing chief, noted US at an inflection point for testing with an average of 3M tests available per day. Aggressive testing seen as key to reopening the economy as we wait for a vaccine.

Respondents felt C&amp;I inquiries from MSLP-sized borrowers may increase in next three months, though they do not see themselves extending more MSLP loans. Many banks said they were able to address borrowers' needs without the MSLP while also complaining about unattractive loan terms and MSLP registration requirements.

However, the September drawdown has been viewed by some as largely an unwinding of market excesses, rather than any shift in the macro narrative. The bullish camp still sees the market underpinned by the monetary policy tailwind, earnings rebound, vaccine potential and broader economic reopening theme. In addition, there is still some semblance of hope for a fiscal stimulus deal, election uncertainty now seems to be the consensus, some strategists have cited month/quarter end rebalancing as supportive of stocks, M&amp;A activity continues to pick up and coronavirus testing capacity is ramping.\n\n**Trump second-term plans likely to revolve around taxes:**\n\n* President Trump's second-term policy priorities getting some discussion, with policy records and the economy on tonight's debate agenda.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 7th, 2020.\n\n# **The stock market shakeout is likely not over yet, even with Friday\u2019s comeback  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/04/the-stock-market-shakeout-is-likely-not-over-yet-even-with-fridays-comeback.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The tech wreck is probably not over, despite Friday\u2019s market comeback.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect the shakeout in stocks to continue after the long Labor Day weekend, especially in technology names and the Nasdaq, areas of the market that notched the sharpest gains.\n*****\n&gt; After August\u2019s 7% gain in the S&amp;P 500, stocks started September strong, and then just as quickly rolled over. The Nasdaq lost 5% Thursday and was down sharply Friday but pared losses to decline 1.5%. The S&amp;P 500 was down about 2.3% for the week, even after a 3.5% loss Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this is a good wake-up call and a reminder that there are risks out there,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cIn August, we did take a little bit off the table.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect the week ahead to be busy, with holidays ending and more market pros back at their desks. There is some economic data, most importantly Friday\u2019s consumer price index. The reading on consumer inflation is expected to show little change in core inflation with forecasts for a gain of just 0.2% in August, or 1.6% year over year.\n*****\n&gt; # Froth blowing off\n&gt; The stock sell-off came as market pros were becoming increasingly wary of froth in the market, particularly in tech and momentum names. On Friday, it was revealed that SoftBank was behind billions in large options bets on individual tech stocks, like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla. News reports said the trades were made over the past month, and SoftBank had been building unusually large positions in call options, or those that bet the prices of underlying stocks would rise.\n*****\n&gt; One analyst said the fact that SoftBank was \u201cgunning the market\u201d makes him worry that there is more selling to come in Nasdaq names. As SoftBank bought call options, the sellers had to buy stocks, conceivably driving up prices in a trading feedback loop.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a trip to the casino,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cIf they\u2019re supposed to be an investment company taking a long-term horizon, then trying to juice your short-term return through options, you\u2019ve turned into a hedge fund.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan strategists said they expect the market to recover gradually, but there are still presidential election uncertainties looming in the next couple of months.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe significant reduction in previously extreme long positions in Nasdaq by momentum traders should allow the equity market to recover over the coming weeks, as happened after the June 11th correction,\u201d noted JPMorgan analysts. \u201cBut a repeat of the strong gains seen during July and August is less likely over the next two months.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there could be more selling in the tech and internet companies, or those that were viewed did well as workers stayed home and the economy was shutdown. \u201cIt\u2019s not the start of a big lasting correction, but a forewarning the next couple of weeks and months are going to be choppy. I think it\u2019s going to be a sideways kind of market,\u201d Grohowski said. He added the market could be choppy in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re a little more cautious, not to mention the market is trading at 23 times our earnings estimates for 2021,\u201d said Grohowski. He said the fact there is about $4.5 trillion in money market funds is a bullish signm since that money could find its way into the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the S&amp;P 500 could dip to its 200-day moving average, or 3,092, before rebounding, which would be about a 15% move in total.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t think the sell-off is over. Nasdaq is up 83%s since March 23, the S&amp;P is up 63%,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/34qCxpv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/1u5feMS.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/WfvTGox.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/sDw87zF7/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bUFp72p.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cgvDyfD.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SJ4plDu.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/g1WP8F6.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/GtFbRTWy/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NcrK823.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NkAezup.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/D3X10mF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Caps Best Day After Labor Day\n\n&gt; In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.16% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last eight years, but DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last three years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market\u2019s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.25%.

But, is this bullish or bearish for the market in the coming months? Hopefully the table below provides some perspective by comparing the previous Top 20 S&amp;P 500 Augusts since 1949 to July, September, Q4 and the succeeding \u201cBest Six Months\u201d November-April.\n\n&gt; Subsequent Septembers were down 15 of 20 years for an average loss of -1.0% (median loss of -0.7%). Q4 is positive with gains in 13 of the 20 years for an average gain of 1.0% (median gain of 3.0%). The following Best Six Months are more bullish, up 16 of the 20 years with an average gain of 7.6% (median gain of 8.5%).\n\n&gt; Looking at just the 7 years that were preceded by big Julys shows some improvement for September but Q4s are worse, containing the largest Q4 losses. Back-to-back big Julys and big Augusts were followed by improved Best Six Months results, up in all 7 instances with a higher average and median gain and the top gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/7bd7299f2e7714adc709577da928964e/bd54fb998db4a9e1-46/s1280x1920/3363ff03bfc2dead6e88b387771b6bbad2aafece.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Analyzing the Jobs Report\n\n&gt; The jobs market remains strong, as the August nonfarm payrolls came in at a solid 1.37 million jobs created, right in line with expectations. This was the fourth consecutive month of gains, up 10.6 million over this time frame. In March and April more than 22 million jobs were lost, so we still aren\u2019t quite to half of the jobs recovered though.\n\n&gt; This was the second consecutive month there was a very weak ADP private payrolls number ahead of the monthly jobs report, adding to the worries, but the actual nonfarm payroll number was once again quite solid. Don\u2019t forget, just yesterday we saw initial jobless claims come in at 881,000, the lowest number since the week ending March 14, another improving employment number.\n\n&gt; The big surprise in today\u2019s report though was the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%, from 10.2% last month and an expected 9.8%. This was the lowest unemployment rate since 4.4% in March.\n\n&gt; \u201cThis was an impressive report and once again showed the economy remained quite resilient,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut 8% unemployment is 8% unemployment, so let\u2019s not get too excited, but we\u2019ll still take this improving trend in the employment picture.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, even though more than 10 million jobs have been created in the past four months, the sad truth is we are still quite a long way from recovering all the jobs lost due to the pandemic. In fact, looking at previous cycles, it has taken years for all of the lost jobs to come back and this time doesn\u2019t appear any different.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Blog-9.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; One thing to consider is could this solid number make it harder for Washington to agree on the next stimulus plan? We are watching this closely, but with the two sides still close to a trillion dollars apart, today\u2019s report will likely do little to help the two sides come to a quick resolution.\n\n&gt; Last, don\u2019t forget that stocks gained more than 60% in less than six months, so some weakness would be perfectly normal. In fact, looking at the two previous strongest starts to a bull market ever (\u201982 and \u201909) both saw some weakness right around now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Blog-9.4.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3 Charts To Watch If You Are Bullish\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index just closed the door on its best August since 1986, making new all-time highs along the way, while also closing up five months in a row.\n\n&gt; First things first, make no mistake about it; this is a new bull market. That of course doesn\u2019t mean it will last years like previous bull markets, but a nearly 57% gain in 5 months is what we\u2019d classify as a bull market.\n\n&gt; Here are all the bull markets going back to the Great Depression and where this one ranks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Now let\u2019s dig into the 5 month win streak. It is quite rare for stocks to gain from April through August, as the summer months tend to be somewhat tricky. Yet, we found there were six other years that saw these 5 months all close higher and the rest of the year was higher five times, with some solid returns in there. In fact, the only year that was lower the rest of the year was 2018, mainly due to the Fed policy mistake in December 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhat might surprise many investors is 5 month win streaks are actually incredibly bullish going forward,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, a year after a 5 month win streak has seen the S&amp;P 500 higher 25 of the past 26 times.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 Index gained more than 35% during this 5 month win streak, the most ever. Yet, the future gains after 5 month win streaks is very impressive, higher 25 out of 26 times a year later. An object in motion tends to stay in motion and this sure seems to be the case here.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year\n\n&gt; What a month August has been so far, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 7%, for the best August since 1984. Not to be outdone, this is the first time in history August saw two separate 6-day (or more) win streaks. Last, with one day to go, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16 days so far this month, for the most since 16 in April 2019. Meanwhile, it is the most up days for any August since 2003.\n\n&gt; \u201cWell, 2020 has laughed at many of these things, but be aware September is indeed the worst month of the year on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut what caught our attention was both September and October have a negative return during election years, with October the worst month of the year. Could investors get election jitters again in 2020?\u201d\n\n&gt; As show in the LPL Chart of the Day, September tends to be a weak month. In fact, it is the weakest month on average since 1950. Additionally, the last two times August was up more than 5% were 1986 and 2000; the S&amp;P 500 fell 8.5% and 5.4% in September those years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking things down by just an election year shows that August actually tends to be strong. That obviously played out this year, but now will the weakness we usually see in September and October play out?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Finally, after today, the S&amp;P 500 will be up 5 consecutive months. Looking at the other years that saw a similar summer rallies, there tended to be more strength the final 4 months of the year, with only the Federal Reserve policy mistake of December 2018 blemishing this impressive track record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chaert-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Yes, this record equity run is extremely stretched, but we would continue to use any pullbacks as an opportunity to add to longer-term core equity holdings, as the economy continues to come back quicker than most expected.\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/GtFbRTWy/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/2yRCg7KY/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.7.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 7th, 2020.\n\n# **The stock market shakeout is likely not over yet, even with Friday\u2019s comeback  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/04/the-stock-market-shakeout-is-likely-not-over-yet-even-with-fridays-comeback.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The tech wreck is probably not over, despite Friday\u2019s market comeback.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect the shakeout in stocks to continue after the long Labor Day weekend, especially in technology names and the Nasdaq, areas of the market that notched the sharpest gains.\n*****\n&gt; After August\u2019s 7% gain in the S&amp;P 500, stocks started September strong, and then just as quickly rolled over. The Nasdaq lost 5% Thursday and was down sharply Friday but pared losses to decline 1.5%. The S&amp;P 500 was down about 2.3% for the week, even after a 3.5% loss Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this is a good wake-up call and a reminder that there are risks out there,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cIn August, we did take a little bit off the table.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect the week ahead to be busy, with holidays ending and more market pros back at their desks. There is some economic data, most importantly Friday\u2019s consumer price index. The reading on consumer inflation is expected to show little change in core inflation with forecasts for a gain of just 0.2% in August, or 1.6% year over year.\n*****\n&gt; # Froth blowing off\n&gt; The stock sell-off came as market pros were becoming increasingly wary of froth in the market, particularly in tech and momentum names. On Friday, it was revealed that SoftBank was behind billions in large options bets on individual tech stocks, like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla. News reports said the trades were made over the past month, and SoftBank had been building unusually large positions in call options, or those that bet the prices of underlying stocks would rise.\n*****\n&gt; One analyst said the fact that SoftBank was \u201cgunning the market\u201d makes him worry that there is more selling to come in Nasdaq names. As SoftBank bought call options, the sellers had to buy stocks, conceivably driving up prices in a trading feedback loop.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a trip to the casino,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cIf they\u2019re supposed to be an investment company taking a long-term horizon, then trying to juice your short-term return through options, you\u2019ve turned into a hedge fund.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan strategists said they expect the market to recover gradually, but there are still presidential election uncertainties looming in the next couple of months.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe significant reduction in previously extreme long positions in Nasdaq by momentum traders should allow the equity market to recover over the coming weeks, as happened after the June 11th correction,\u201d noted JPMorgan analysts. \u201cBut a repeat of the strong gains seen during July and August is less likely over the next two months.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there could be more selling in the tech and internet companies, or those that were viewed did well as workers stayed home and the economy was shutdown. \u201cIt\u2019s not the start of a big lasting correction, but a forewarning the next couple of weeks and months are going to be choppy. I think it\u2019s going to be a sideways kind of market,\u201d Grohowski said. He added the market could be choppy in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re a little more cautious, not to mention the market is trading at 23 times our earnings estimates for 2021,\u201d said Grohowski. He said the fact there is about $4.5 trillion in money market funds is a bullish signm since that money could find its way into the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the S&amp;P 500 could dip to its 200-day moving average, or 3,092, before rebounding, which would be about a 15% move in total.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t think the sell-off is over. Nasdaq is up 83%s since March 23, the S&amp;P is up 63%,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/34qCxpv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/1u5feMS.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/WfvTGox.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/sDw87zF7/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bUFp72p.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cgvDyfD.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SJ4plDu.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/g1WP8F6.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/GtFbRTWy/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NcrK823.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NkAezup.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/D3X10mF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Caps Best Day After Labor Day\n\n&gt; In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.16% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last eight years, but DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last three years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market\u2019s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.25%.

But, is this bullish or bearish for the market in the coming months? Hopefully the table below provides some perspective by comparing the previous Top 20 S&amp;P 500 Augusts since 1949 to July, September, Q4 and the succeeding \u201cBest Six Months\u201d November-April.\n\n&gt; Subsequent Septembers were down 15 of 20 years for an average loss of -1.0% (median loss of -0.7%). Q4 is positive with gains in 13 of the 20 years for an average gain of 1.0% (median gain of 3.0%). The following Best Six Months are more bullish, up 16 of the 20 years with an average gain of 7.6% (median gain of 8.5%).\n\n&gt; Looking at just the 7 years that were preceded by big Julys shows some improvement for September but Q4s are worse, containing the largest Q4 losses. Back-to-back big Julys and big Augusts were followed by improved Best Six Months results, up in all 7 instances with a higher average and median gain and the top gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/7bd7299f2e7714adc709577da928964e/bd54fb998db4a9e1-46/s1280x1920/3363ff03bfc2dead6e88b387771b6bbad2aafece.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Analyzing the Jobs Report\n\n&gt; The jobs market remains strong, as the August nonfarm payrolls came in at a solid 1.37 million jobs created, right in line with expectations. This was the fourth consecutive month of gains, up 10.6 million over this time frame. In March and April more than 22 million jobs were lost, so we still aren\u2019t quite to half of the jobs recovered though.\n\n&gt; This was the second consecutive month there was a very weak ADP private payrolls number ahead of the monthly jobs report, adding to the worries, but the actual nonfarm payroll number was once again quite solid. Don\u2019t forget, just yesterday we saw initial jobless claims come in at 881,000, the lowest number since the week ending March 14, another improving employment number.\n\n&gt; The big surprise in today\u2019s report though was the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%, from 10.2% last month and an expected 9.8%. This was the lowest unemployment rate since 4.4% in March.\n\n&gt; \u201cThis was an impressive report and once again showed the economy remained quite resilient,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut 8% unemployment is 8% unemployment, so let\u2019s not get too excited, but we\u2019ll still take this improving trend in the employment picture.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, even though more than 10 million jobs have been created in the past four months, the sad truth is we are still quite a long way from recovering all the jobs lost due to the pandemic. In fact, looking at previous cycles, it has taken years for all of the lost jobs to come back and this time doesn\u2019t appear any different.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Blog-9.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; One thing to consider is could this solid number make it harder for Washington to agree on the next stimulus plan? We are watching this closely, but with the two sides still close to a trillion dollars apart, today\u2019s report will likely do little to help the two sides come to a quick resolution.\n\n&gt; Last, don\u2019t forget that stocks gained more than 60% in less than six months, so some weakness would be perfectly normal. In fact, looking at the two previous strongest starts to a bull market ever (\u201982 and \u201909) both saw some weakness right around now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Blog-9.4.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3 Charts To Watch If You Are Bullish\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index just closed the door on its best August since 1986, making new all-time highs along the way, while also closing up five months in a row.\n\n&gt; First things first, make no mistake about it; this is a new bull market. That of course doesn\u2019t mean it will last years like previous bull markets, but a nearly 57% gain in 5 months is what we\u2019d classify as a bull market.\n\n&gt; Here are all the bull markets going back to the Great Depression and where this one ranks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Now let\u2019s dig into the 5 month win streak. It is quite rare for stocks to gain from April through August, as the summer months tend to be somewhat tricky. Yet, we found there were six other years that saw these 5 months all close higher and the rest of the year was higher five times, with some solid returns in there. In fact, the only year that was lower the rest of the year was 2018, mainly due to the Fed policy mistake in December 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhat might surprise many investors is 5 month win streaks are actually incredibly bullish going forward,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, a year after a 5 month win streak has seen the S&amp;P 500 higher 25 of the past 26 times.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 Index gained more than 35% during this 5 month win streak, the most ever. Yet, the future gains after 5 month win streaks is very impressive, higher 25 out of 26 times a year later. An object in motion tends to stay in motion and this sure seems to be the case here.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year\n\n&gt; What a month August has been so far, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 7%, for the best August since 1984. Not to be outdone, this is the first time in history August saw two separate 6-day (or more) win streaks. Last, with one day to go, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16 days so far this month, for the most since 16 in April 2019. Meanwhile, it is the most up days for any August since 2003.\n\n&gt; \u201cWell, 2020 has laughed at many of these things, but be aware September is indeed the worst month of the year on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut what caught our attention was both September and October have a negative return during election years, with October the worst month of the year. Could investors get election jitters again in 2020?\u201d\n\n&gt; As show in the LPL Chart of the Day, September tends to be a weak month. In fact, it is the weakest month on average since 1950. Additionally, the last two times August was up more than 5% were 1986 and 2000; the S&amp;P 500 fell 8.5% and 5.4% in September those years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking things down by just an election year shows that August actually tends to be strong. That obviously played out this year, but now will the weakness we usually see in September and October play out?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Finally, after today, the S&amp;P 500 will be up 5 consecutive months. Looking at the other years that saw a similar summer rallies, there tended to be more strength the final 4 months of the year, with only the Federal Reserve policy mistake of December 2018 blemishing this impressive track record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chaert-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Yes, this record equity run is extremely stretched, but we would continue to use any pullbacks as an opportunity to add to longer-term core equity holdings, as the economy continues to come back quicker than most expected.\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/GtFbRTWy/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/2yRCg7KY/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.7.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.

Let me know\n\n\\------\n\nAccolade Inc ($ACCD)\n\nIPO July 2020: [https://www.geekwire.com/2020/accolade-ceo-raj-singh-health-tech-companys-ipo-path-profits-pandemics-second-hit/](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/accolade-ceo-raj-singh-health-tech-companys-ipo-path-profits-pandemics-second-hit/)\n\n**Business Model:**\n\nACC plays in the healthcare industry. Their target customers are employers that are interested in helping their employees manage benefits through the employee insurance. What do they do exactly? Two things: Technology + Service. But let\u2019s look at the business model in example:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccolade currently only has 60 customers, they have some big ones (Comcast, Intuit, American Airlines)\n\n\\- AA sets up with Accolade to manage their employee benefits\n\n\\- ACCD already has a partner ecosystem with various payers (Cigna, united, etc.)\n\n\\- AA employees will still choose their desired insurance plan based on their needs during Open Enrollment (US-only)\n\n\\- Throughout the year, employee John needs to see a doctor/specialist but is unsure of what to do, where to go, or how much it will cost\n\n\\- Because AA has Accolade, John is able to connect with a health advocate at ACCD to directly ask for help on what he should do\n\n\\- ACCD with their data analytics and network helps John and advises on who to go to\n\n\\- Once John is done, he also needs help with his claims to the insurance\n\n\\- ACCD once again, helps John along with filing the insurance claims\n\n\\- AA pays a per employee cost for their entire service contract\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Example ACCD benefits by customers:**\n\n\\- Intuit: [https://www.intuitbenefits.com/health-care/accolade-health-assistant](https://www.intuitbenefits.com/health-care/accolade-health-assistant)\n\n\\- American Airlines: [https://my.aa.com/accolade/](https://my.aa.com/accolade/)\n\n\\- Seattle City Gov\u2019t:[https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/HumanResources/Benefits/Accolade-FAQs.pdf](https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/HumanResources/Benefits/Accolade-FAQs.pdf) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Let\u2019s break down their market advantage-\n\n**Technology**:\n\n\\- Their competitive advantage is what they market, using data analytics to evaluate what is the best treatment, medication, and cost for a customer\u2019s employees when they need care. They also have various tech in place to support this business process: mobile app for customers to connect, portals directly for the employees to access ([https://login.myaccolade.com](https://login.myaccolade.com)), and integrated service facing tools.\n\n\\- They recently bought claims data company in 2019 ([https://www.inquirer.com/business/comcast-accolade-healthcare-digital-california-20190801.html](https://www.inquirer.com/business/comcast-accolade-healthcare-digital-california-20190801.html)). My guess is that they\u2019re using this to add to their analytics to provide better recommendations to employees on what doctors and benefits to use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Service**: \n\n\\- This one is simple, they hire health advocates and nurses, etc. as service reps on the other side of the line to respond to employees. These advocate reps are would review an employees benefits and provide the recommendations. \n\n\\- They also help the employees with filing any paperwork or additional claims processing. \n\n\\- Typically, a single customer account will have a designated service team that handles their employee benefits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Competitors**:\n\n\\- Collective Health is their main competitor ([https://collectivehealth.com/](https://collectivehealth.com/)). They also provide a benefit concierge service. Their target is on self funded insurance plans. Biggest customers are Zendesk, Palantir, Activision, etc. They have had \\~400mil in investor funding to date.\n\n\\- CastLight Health ($CSLT) plays in this similar space but only provide the technology backend. They do not provide or manage service in the way that ACCD and CH do. They have also fumbled poorly with the leadership and revenue, their stock has plummeted as a result. \n\n\\- It is worth noting that ACCD and CH do not compete with HRIS and Benefit Planning software (e.g. WDAY, ADP, Peoplesoft, etc). Those processes and tools remain as-is for target customers. It is my understanding that this health care service is focused on post-benefit enrollment and day-to-day needs of employees with their actual healthcare prescribers and practices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Financial Analysis:** \n\n\\- They are currently running a very high cost/loss with growing revenue. Trading at \\~7-8x revenue\n\n\\- They hire a lot on payroll for their services (\\~1500 employees). CH only has several hundred.\n\n\\- Growth risk and continuation is needed, AA and Comcast make up a significant portion of their revenue\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Personal Take:**\n\n\\- I favor their executive team, heavily. ACCD was founded in 2007 by Tom Spann. But the leadership was replaced by current CEO in 2015, who brought along his Concur co founders. He and his co founders sold concur off to SAP for billions back in 2014. Concur is big in the corporate world. If  Singh and his team can be strategic about this space and market, then I think we can see ACCD bag more customers and be a staple name in corporate health insurance. \n\n\\- The risks to this company - in survey data, \\~47% of individuals in the US get their insurance from their employer. ([https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/small-business/how-many-americans-get-health-insurance-from-their-employer](https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/small-business/how-many-americans-get-health-insurance-from-their-employer)) This means their growth is limited in size. Additionally, what about global? I have no idea how insurance plays globally and whether this has market fit.\n\n\\- IPO price action sold off on the first day. It seems while we see interest in tele health such as LVGO and TDOC, the market doesn\u2019t favor ACCD - possibly due to its weak financials. \n\n\\- Personally, I see this as a 50/50. There financial risk at this time but has high potential to succeed if their management is able to sell, execute, and change the industry in general.", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 756342, "public", "self", "ACCD DD - Accolade, new health tech disruptor or bust?", 0, [], 0.67, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hueydf/accd_dd_accolade_new_health_tech_disruptor_or_bust/", "all_ads", 6, 1595215980.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "genuisgeek", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1606u5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595219580, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hueydf/accd_dd_accolade_new_health_tech_disruptor_or_bust/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hueydf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "tickerdiscussion", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "612ee368-65e6-11e5-b53f-129e4297eb59", "link_flair_text": "Ticker Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/hueydf/accd_dd_accolade_new_health_tech_disruptor_or_bust/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "gvvf9l3CyG7EY46fbAiYH7xr-JGBigAtSZNwKEkuo9Y", "resolutions": [{"height": 61, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/DrxutMH0VzTOZXf9snRwTWV9CCXrtPs8n_8KllyFpW4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d1ddd29c7183a6a937d52a439f3fe29e3a9128a", "width": 108}, {"height": 122, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/DrxutMH0VzTOZXf9snRwTWV9CCXrtPs8n_8KllyFpW4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=269aa6bc0313b81eef189bb54623367968943284", "width": 216}, {"height": 181, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/DrxutMH0VzTOZXf9snRwTWV9CCXrtPs8n_8KllyFpW4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c8c5b24f1dfb503e7a449e748945c73b7f69e21", "width": 320}, {"height": 363, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/DrxutMH0VzTOZXf9snRwTWV9CCXrtPs8n_8KllyFpW4.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d063cf6af581ca882a6334fa08241f2e65d9a69", "width": 640}, {"height": 545, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/DrxutMH0VzTOZXf9snRwTWV9CCXrtPs8n_8KllyFpW4.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5492e9b82ddf96a9d1080051d564b9670ec0987", "width": 960}, {"height": 613, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/DrxutMH0VzTOZXf9snRwTWV9CCXrtPs8n_8KllyFpW4.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e856426f463229e5ad2b020189dc46cd27a04c2b", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 741, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/DrxutMH0VzTOZXf9snRwTWV9CCXrtPs8n_8KllyFpW4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b1c5a11bada50ab52cdae9cb3449f28ffb43d7a9", "width": 1305}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1595303827, "score": 2, "selftext": "this is my DD on Accolade that just IPO'd earlier this month.

These advocate reps are would review an employees benefits and provide the recommendations. \n\n\\- They also help the employees with filing any paperwork or additional claims processing. \n\n\\- Typically, a single customer account will have a designated service team that handles their employee benefits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Competitors**:\n\n\\- Collective Health is their main competitor ([https://collectivehealth.com/](https://collectivehealth.com/)). They also provide a benefit concierge service. Their target is on self funded insurance plans. Biggest customers are Zendesk, Palantir, Activision, etc. They have had \\~400mil in investor funding to date.\n\n\\- CastLight Health ($CSLT) plays in this similar space but only provide the technology backend. They do not provide or manage service in the way that ACCD and CH do. They have also fumbled poorly with the leadership and revenue, their stock has plummeted as a result. \n\n\\- It is worth noting that ACCD and CH do not compete with HRIS and Benefit Planning software (e.g. WDAY, ADP, Peoplesoft, etc). Those processes and tools remain as-is for target customers. It is my understanding that this health care service is focused on post-benefit enrollment and day-to-day needs of employees with their actual healthcare prescribers and practices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Financial Analysis:** \n\n\\- They are currently running a very high cost/loss with growing revenue. Trading at \\~7-8x revenue\n\n\\- They hire a lot on payroll for their services (\\~1500 employees). CH only has several hundred.\n\n\\- Growth risk and continuation is needed, AA and Comcast make up a significant portion of their revenue\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Personal Take:**\n\n\\- I favor their executive team, heavily. ACCD was founded in 2007 by Tom Spann. But the leadership was replaced by current CEO in 2015, who brought along his Concur co founders. He and his co founders sold concur off to SAP for billions back in 2014. Concur is big in the corporate world. If  Singh and his team can be strategic about this space and market, then I think we can see ACCD bag more customers and be a staple name in corporate health insurance. \n\n\\- The risks to this company - in survey data, \\~47% of individuals in the US get their insurance from their employer. ([https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/small-business/how-many-americans-get-health-insurance-from-their-employer](https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/small-business/how-many-americans-get-health-insurance-from-their-employer)) This means their growth is limited in size. Additionally, what about global? I have no idea how insurance plays globally and whether this has market fit.\n\n\\- IPO price action sold off on the first day. It seems while we see interest in tele health such as LVGO and TDOC, the market doesn\u2019t favor ACCD - possibly due to its weak financials. \n\n\\- Personally, I see this as a 50/50. There financial risk at this time but has high potential to succeed if their management is able to sell, execute, and change the industry in general.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 756342, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "ACCD DD - Accolade, new health tech disruptor or bust?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hueydf/accd_dd_accolade_new_health_tech_disruptor_or_bust/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1595215980.0}], [[], false, "bigbear0083", null, [], null, "text", "t2_eaak0", false, true, [], false, false, 1591460055, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gxtspc/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", {}, "gxtspc", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 16, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/gxtspc/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", false, "self", {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "vSkvs_suTJNcw6O6P579HHS6v9SgrBmLuqz7VonKhZY", "resolutions": [{"height": 67, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/PEU9Px2UYg3NSl_QbpLidG-KUH9204-T4nPi0O1StLk.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db43ab185974682e3454466afefb60a832343ab9", "width": 108}, {"height": 134, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/PEU9Px2UYg3NSl_QbpLidG-KUH9204-T4nPi0O1StLk.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9c5d4d99258e57e15ad53b2bb86d424a101a8b4", "width": 216}, {"height": 198, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/PEU9Px2UYg3NSl_QbpLidG-KUH9204-T4nPi0O1StLk.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4120b1b373ada9a23bddcdbe293c1dc7e2a4c1d4", "width": 320}, {"height": 397, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/PEU9Px2UYg3NSl_QbpLidG-KUH9204-T4nPi0O1StLk.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7c0fa10d641466dcdd389e5886e5b58405e43dc", "width": 640}, {"height": 596, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/PEU9Px2UYg3NSl_QbpLidG-KUH9204-T4nPi0O1StLk.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01c959d2175d528539b0b4a170cd11263ac4fa64", "width": 960}, {"height": 670, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/PEU9Px2UYg3NSl_QbpLidG-KUH9204-T4nPi0O1StLk.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8757c450fb7b863c1a9ab28e7f8139cb7f010b67", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 766, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/PEU9Px2UYg3NSl_QbpLidG-KUH9204-T4nPi0O1StLk.png?auto=webp&amp;s=d738ef4424ecdbfd9ec1642a43bd9ad8c00445cc", "width": 1233}, "variants": {}}]}, 6, 1591460056, 1, "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks.

That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways.

S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

I'm open to all input or criticism! Anyways, here goes:\n\nCMI (Cummins) - 4.5% yield. As a cyclical industrial company, it had already been trading down since October or November so it's at an even further discount to companies which were setting ATHs in February. Rock solid management with a shit ton of cash flow and a low payout ratio. \n\nHON (Honeywell) - 3.2% yield. Widely diversified company in many sustainable/critical markets like defense which has taken an absolute nosedive from $183 to below $110. \n\nABBV (AbbVie) - 6.8% yield. One of the riskier options as it's still working through the massive Allergan acquisition. However it's received most of the approvals it needs and acquiring Allergan (who's biggest product is Botox) will help it diversify once the patent on Humira, by far its biggest revenue generator, expires in the next few years. \n\nRTN/UTX (Raytheon/United Technologies) - both above 3% yield. I list both because they're currently in the process of merging with each other, but both have become good dividend choices with the current panic. I also mention both because it's a merger of equals which will create a new company under the ticker RTX. Raytheon has always had good management and was a great growth stock while United always was a better stock in down times, but both have been hammered. While there are some risks and the actual process will take forever since they're both huge, the businesses seem to have a lot of synergistic opportunities and as a result would probably be able to deliver a stable dividend down the road. \n\nJPM (JP Morgan) - 4.3% yield. I see them as the most conservative bank as during the recession they didn't even want bailout money because the business was fine, but were forced to take it. over the past few years JPM outperformed the market by a relatively sizable margin and has vastly improved at a structural level since the recession. I think this will be a similar outcome and see their dividend as safe. \n\nADP (ADP) - 3.2% yield. Has increased the dividend for 47 years straight and in my opinion is a consumer staple, but for businesses - so many businesses use their services for payroll that it seems relatively reliable in the current scenario. Nevertheless the market doesn't give a shit and the stock's been hit hard. \n\nPLD (Prologis) - 3.6% yield.

Daily swings like this over a two-week period were only seen at the peak of the financial crisis and in 2011 when U.S. sovereign debt got its first-ever downgrade, the firm said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe message to all investors is that they should expect this volatility to continue. This should be considered the new normal going forward,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped north of 1,000 points twice in the past week, only to erase the quadruple-digit gains in the subsequent sessions. The coronavirus outbreak kept investors on edge as global cases of the infections surpassed 100,000. It\u2019s also spreading rapidly in the U.S. California has declared a state of emergency, while the number of cases in New York reached 33.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cUncertainty breeds greater market volatility,\u201d Keith Lerner, SunTrust\u2019s chief market strategist, said in a note. \u201cMuch is still unknown about how severe and widespread the coronavirus will become. From a market perspective, what we are seeing is uncomfortable but somewhat typical after shock periods.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # More stimulus?\n&gt; So far, the actions from global central banks and governments in response to the outbreak haven\u2019t triggered a sustainable rebound.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis did little to calm investor anxiety. President Donald Trump on Friday signed a sweeping spending bill with an$8.3 billion packageto aid prevention efforts to produce a vaccine for the deadly disease, but stocks extended their heavy rout that day.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is recognizing the global authorities are responding to this,\u201d said Tom Essaye, founder of the Sevens Report. \u201cIf the market begins to worry they are not doing that sufficiently, then I think we are going to go down ugly. It is helping stocks hold up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Essaye said any further stimulus from China and a decent-sized fiscal package from Germany would be positive to the market, but he doesn\u2019t expect the moves to create a huge rebound.\n*****\n&gt; The fed funds future market is now pricing in the possibility of the U.S. central bank cutting by 75 basis points at its March 17-18 meeting.\n*****\n&gt; # Where is the bottom?\n&gt; Many on Wall Street expect the market to fall further before recovering as the health crisis unfolds.\n*****\n&gt; Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief equity strategist, sees a bottom for the S&amp;P 500 in the second quarter after stocks falling as much as 20% from their recent peak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe magnitude of the selloff in the S&amp;P 500 so far has further to go; and in terms of duration, just two weeks in, it is much too early to declare this episode as being done,\u201d Chadha said in a note. \u201cWe do view the impacts on macro and earnings growth as being relatively short-lived and the market eventually looking through them.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Deutsche Bank maintained its year-end target of 3,250 for the S&amp;P 500, which would represent a 10% gain from here and a flat return for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists are also urging patience during this heightened volatility, cautioning against panic selling.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt is during times like these that investors need to maintain a longer-term perspective and stick to their investment process rather than making knee-jerk, binary decisions,\u201d Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qgFoWQB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7eQW0Js.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mFotkBJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/XSXVPJQ.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/deKt8eq.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HYaxtrz.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yygsO0C.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oCNZNbl.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y35bngj.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/E6twMcN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ttAWeD2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Dl7NlBA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A \"Run of the Mill\" Drawdown\n\n&gt; If you're like us, you've heard a lot of people reference the recent equity declines as a sign that the market is pricing in some sort of Armageddon in the US economy. While comments like that make for great soundbites, a little perspective is in order. Since the S&amp;P 500's high on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500 is down 12.8%. In the chart below, we show the S&amp;P 500's annual maximum drawdown by year going back to 1928. In the entire history of the index, the median maximum drawdown from a YTD high is 13.05%. In other words, this year's decline is actually less than normal. Perhaps due to the fact that we have only seen one larger-than-average drawdown in the last eight years is why this one feels so bad.\n\n&gt; The fact that the current decline has only been inline with the historical norm raises a number of questions. For example, if the market has already priced in the worst-case scenario, going out and adding some equity exposure would be a no brainer. However, if we're only in the midst of a 'normal' drawdown in the equity market as the coronavirus outbreak threatens to put the economy into a recession, one could argue that things for the stock market could get worse before they get better, especially when we know that the market can be prone to over-reaction in both directions. The fact is that nobody knows right now how this entire outbreak will play out. If it really is a black swan, the market definitely has further to fall and now would present a great opportunity to sell more equities. However, if it proves to be temporary and after a quarter or two resolves itself and the economy gets back on the path it was on at the start of the year, then the magnitude of the current decline is probably appropriate. As they say, that's what makes a market!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Drawdowns.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Long-Term Treasuries Go Haywire\n\n&gt; Take a good luck at today's moves in long-term US Treasury yields, because chances are you won't see moves of this magnitude again soon. Let's start with the yield on the 30-year US Treasury. Today's decline of 29 basis points in the yield will go down as the largest one-day decline in the yield on the 30-year since 2009. For some perspective, there have only been 25 other days since 1977 where the yield saw a larger one day decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; That doesn't even tell the whole story, though. As shown in the chart below, every other time the yield saw a sharper one-day decline, the actual yield of the 30-year was much higher, and in most other cases it was much, much higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Yield.png))**\n\n&gt; To show this another way, the percentage change in the yield on the 30-year has never been seen before, and it's not even close. Now, before the chart crime police come calling, we realize showing a percentage change of a percentage is not the most accurate representation, but we wanted to show this for illustrative purposes only.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Percent-change-in-yield.png))**\n\n&gt; Finally, with long-term interest rates plummetting we wanted to provide an update on the performance of the Austrian 100-year bond. That's now back at record highs, begging the question, why is the US not flooding the market with long-term debt?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Austria.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It Doesn't Get Much Worse Than This For Crude Oil\n\n&gt; Crude oil prices are down close to 10% today in what is shaping up to be the worst day for crude oil since late 2014. That's more than five years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-Daily-Changes.png))**\n\n&gt; Today's decline is pretty much a continuation of what has been a one-way trade for the commodity ever since the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani. The last time prices were this low was around Christmas 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil.png))**\n\n&gt; With today's decline, crude oil is now off to its worst start to a year in a generation falling 32%. Since 1984, the only other year that was worse was 1986 when the year started out with a decline of 50% through March 6th. If you're looking for a bright spot, in 1986, prices rose 36% over the remainder of the year. The only other year where crude oil kicked off the year with a 30% decline was in 1991 after the first Iraq war. Over the remainder of that year, prices rose a more modest 5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-YTD-Starts.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Year Treasury Yield Breaks Below 1%\n\n&gt; Despite strong market gains on Wednesday, March 4, 2020, the on-the-run 10-year Treasury yield ended the day below 1% for the first time ever and has posted additional declines in real time, sitting at 0.92% intraday as this blog is being written. \u201cThe decline in yields has been remarkable,\u201d said LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe 10-year Treasury yield has dipped below 1%, and today\u2019s declines are likely to make the recent run lower the largest decline of the cycle.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in LPL Research\u2019s chart of the day, the current decline in the 10-year Treasury yield without a meaningful reversal (defined as at least 0.75%) is approaching the decline seen in 2011 and 2012 and would need about another two months to be the longest decline in length of time. At the same time, no prior decline has lasted forever and a pattern of declines and increases has been normal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-chart-3.5.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield lower?\n\n&gt; * A shrinking but still sizable yield advantage over other developed market sovereign debt\n&gt; * Added stock volatility if downside risks to economic growth from the coronavirus increase\n&gt; * A larger potential premium over shorter-term yields if the Federal Reserve aggressively cuts interest rates\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield higher?\n\n&gt; * A second half economic rebound acting a catalyst for a Treasury sell-off\n&gt; * As yields move lower, investors may increasingly seek more attractive sources of income\n&gt; * Any dollar weakness could lead to some selling by international investors\n&gt; * Longer maturity Treasuries are looking like an increasingly crowded trade, potentially adding energy to any sell-off\n\n&gt; On balance, our view remains that the prospect of an economic rebound over the second half points to the potential for interest rates moving higher. At the same time, we still see some advantage in the potential diversification benefits of intermediate maturity high-quality bonds, especially during periods of market stress. We continue to recommend that suitable investors consider keeping a bond portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates below that of the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index by emphasizing short to intermediate maturity bonds, but do not believe it\u2019s time to pile into very short maturities despite the 10-year Treasury yield sitting at historically low levels.\n\n*****\n\n# U.S. Jobs Growth Marches On\n\n&gt; While stock markets continue to be extremely volatile as they come to terms with how the coronavirus may affect global growth, the U.S. job market has remained remarkably robust. Continued U.S. jobs data resilience in the face of headwinds from the coronavirus outbreak may be a key factor in prolonging the expansion, given how important the strength of the U.S. consumer has been late into this expansion.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Department of Labor today reported that U.S. nonfarm payroll data had a strong showing of 273,000 jobs added in February, topping the expectation of every Bloomberg-surveyed economist, with an additional upward revision of 85,000 additional jobs for December 2019 and January 2020. This has brought the current unemployment rate back to its 50-year low of 3.5%. So far, it appears it\u2019s too soon for any effects of the coronavirus to have been felt in the jobs numbers. (Note: The survey takes place in the middle of each month.)\n\n&gt; On Wednesday, ADP released its private payroll data (excluding government jobs), which increased by 183,000 in February, also handily beating market expectations. Most of these jobs were added in the service sector, with 44,000 added in the leisure and hospitality sector, and another 31,000 in trade/transportation/utilities. Both of these areas could be at risk of potential cutbacks if consumers start to avoid eating out or other leisure pursuits due to coronavirus fears.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, payrolls remain strong, and any effects of the virus outbreaks most likely would be felt in coming months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/US-Jobs-Data.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFebruary\u2019s jobs report shows the 113th straight month that the U.S. jobs market has grown,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s an incredible run and highlights how the U.S. consumer has become key to extending the expansion, especially given setbacks to global growth from the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d\n\n&gt; While there is bound to be some drag on future jobs data from the coronavirus-related slowdown, we would anticipate that the effects of this may be transitory. We believe economic fundamentals continue to suggest the possibility of a second-half-of-the\u2013year economic rebound.\n\n*****\n\n# Down January &amp; Down February: S&amp;P 500 Posts Full-Year Gain Just 43.75% of Time\n\n&gt; The combination of a down January and a down February has come about 17 times, including this year, going back to 1950. Rest of the year and full-year performance has taken a rather sizable hit following the previous 16 occurrences. March through December S&amp;P 500 average performance drops to 2.32% compared to 7.69% in all years. Full-year performance is even worse with S&amp;P 500 average turning to a loss of 4.91% compared to an average gain of 9.14% in all years. All hope for 2020 is not lost as seven of the 16 past down January and down February years did go on to log gains over the last 10 months and full year while six enjoyed double-digit gains from March to December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/781e034df22d242349ff3f8882653cec/b4f07d98317a2635-4d/s500x750/0ea61b1c01085e74593633995acba59fe8a96ce8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Take Caution After Emergency Rate Cut\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s big rally was an encouraging sign that the markets are becoming more comfortable with the public health, monetary and political handling of the situation. But the history of these \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201csurprise\u201d rate cuts by the Fed between meetings suggest some caution remains in order.\n\n&gt; The table here shows that these surprise cuts between meetings have really only \u201cworked\u201d once in the past 20+ years. In 1998 when the Fed and the plunge protection team acted swiftly and in a coordinated manner to stave off the fallout from the financial crisis caused by the collapse of the Russian ruble and the highly leveraged Long Term Capital Management hedge fund markets responded well. This was not the case during the extended bear markets of 2001-2002 and 2007-2009.\n\n&gt; Bottom line: if this is a short-term impact like the 1998 financial crisis the market should recover sooner rather than later. But if the economic impact of coronavirus virus is prolonged, the market is more likely to languish.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd9ae8723eaf077f8baa56e384c8d8f7/e543b6eee32cdf93-81/s500x750/0f2b63108953c1e4cfb97da0a979d4ab3651cdeb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$DKS**\n&gt; * **$AVGO** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$WORK** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$DOCU** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$CLDR** \n&gt; * **$INSG** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$BTAI** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$HEAR** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$ADDYY** \n&gt; * **$GPS** \n&gt; * **$AKBA** \n&gt; * **$PDD** \n&gt; * **$CYOU** \n&gt; * **$FNV** \n&gt; * **$MTNB** \n&gt; * **$NERV** \n&gt; * **$MTN** \n&gt; * **$BEST** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$NINE** \n&gt; * **$AZUL** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$PRPL** \n&gt; * **$VSLR** \n&gt; * **$KLZE** \n&gt; * **$ZUO** \n&gt; * **$DVAX** \n&gt; * **$EXPR** \n&gt; * **$VRA** \n&gt; * **$AXSM** \n&gt; * **$CDMO** \n&gt; * **$CASY**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MY5URDI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Fq1ixYG.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3QxCDMd.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/kG5Cja7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWb2ADY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SH8bsTn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PH2Inly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RToRF8p.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HECD2g3.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvEJ9Vw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $336.77\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

Daily swings like this over a two-week period were only seen at the peak of the financial crisis and in 2011 when U.S. sovereign debt got its first-ever downgrade, the firm said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe message to all investors is that they should expect this volatility to continue. This should be considered the new normal going forward,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped north of 1,000 points twice in the past week, only to erase the quadruple-digit gains in the subsequent sessions.

President Donald Trump on Friday signed a sweeping spending bill with an$8.3 billion packageto aid prevention efforts to produce a vaccine for the deadly disease, but stocks extended their heavy rout that day.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is recognizing the global authorities are responding to this,\u201d said Tom Essaye, founder of the Sevens Report. \u201cIf the market begins to worry they are not doing that sufficiently, then I think we are going to go down ugly.

While comments like that make for great soundbites, a little perspective is in order. Since the S&amp;P 500's high on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500 is down 12.8%. In the chart below, we show the S&amp;P 500's annual maximum drawdown by year going back to 1928. In the entire history of the index, the median maximum drawdown from a YTD high is 13.05%. In other words, this year's decline is actually less than normal. Perhaps due to the fact that we have only seen one larger-than-average drawdown in the last eight years is why this one feels so bad.\n\n&gt; The fact that the current decline has only been inline with the historical norm raises a number of questions. For example, if the market has already priced in the worst-case scenario, going out and adding some equity exposure would be a no brainer. However, if we're only in the midst of a 'normal' drawdown in the equity market as the coronavirus outbreak threatens to put the economy into a recession, one could argue that things for the stock market could get worse before they get better, especially when we know that the market can be prone to over-reaction in both directions. The fact is that nobody knows right now how this entire outbreak will play out. If it really is a black swan, the market definitely has further to fall and now would present a great opportunity to sell more equities. However, if it proves to be temporary and after a quarter or two resolves itself and the economy gets back on the path it was on at the start of the year, then the magnitude of the current decline is probably appropriate. As they say, that's what makes a market!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Drawdowns.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Long-Term Treasuries Go Haywire\n\n&gt; Take a good luck at today's moves in long-term US Treasury yields, because chances are you won't see moves of this magnitude again soon. Let's start with the yield on the 30-year US Treasury. Today's decline of 29 basis points in the yield will go down as the largest one-day decline in the yield on the 30-year since 2009. For some perspective, there have only been 25 other days since 1977 where the yield saw a larger one day decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; That doesn't even tell the whole story, though. As shown in the chart below, every other time the yield saw a sharper one-day decline, the actual yield of the 30-year was much higher, and in most other cases it was much, much higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Yield.png))**\n\n&gt; To show this another way, the percentage change in the yield on the 30-year has never been seen before, and it's not even close. Now, before the chart crime police come calling, we realize showing a percentage change of a percentage is not the most accurate representation, but we wanted to show this for illustrative purposes only.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Percent-change-in-yield.png))**\n\n&gt; Finally, with long-term interest rates plummetting we wanted to provide an update on the performance of the Austrian 100-year bond. That's now back at record highs, begging the question, why is the US not flooding the market with long-term debt?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Austria.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It Doesn't Get Much Worse Than This For Crude Oil\n\n&gt; Crude oil prices are down close to 10% today in what is shaping up to be the worst day for crude oil since late 2014. That's more than five years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-Daily-Changes.png))**\n\n&gt; Today's decline is pretty much a continuation of what has been a one-way trade for the commodity ever since the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani. The last time prices were this low was around Christmas 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil.png))**\n\n&gt; With today's decline, crude oil is now off to its worst start to a year in a generation falling 32%. Since 1984, the only other year that was worse was 1986 when the year started out with a decline of 50% through March 6th. If you're looking for a bright spot, in 1986, prices rose 36% over the remainder of the year. The only other year where crude oil kicked off the year with a 30% decline was in 1991 after the first Iraq war. Over the remainder of that year, prices rose a more modest 5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-YTD-Starts.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Year Treasury Yield Breaks Below 1%\n\n&gt; Despite strong market gains on Wednesday, March 4, 2020, the on-the-run 10-year Treasury yield ended the day below 1% for the first time ever and has posted additional declines in real time, sitting at 0.92% intraday as this blog is being written. \u201cThe decline in yields has been remarkable,\u201d said LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe 10-year Treasury yield has dipped below 1%, and today\u2019s declines are likely to make the recent run lower the largest decline of the cycle.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in LPL Research\u2019s chart of the day, the current decline in the 10-year Treasury yield without a meaningful reversal (defined as at least 0.75%) is approaching the decline seen in 2011 and 2012 and would need about another two months to be the longest decline in length of time. At the same time, no prior decline has lasted forever and a pattern of declines and increases has been normal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-chart-3.5.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield lower?\n\n&gt; * A shrinking but still sizable yield advantage over other developed market sovereign debt\n&gt; * Added stock volatility if downside risks to economic growth from the coronavirus increase\n&gt; * A larger potential premium over shorter-term yields if the Federal Reserve aggressively cuts interest rates\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield higher?\n\n&gt; * A second half economic rebound acting a catalyst for a Treasury sell-off\n&gt; * As yields move lower, investors may increasingly seek more attractive sources of income\n&gt; * Any dollar weakness could lead to some selling by international investors\n&gt; * Longer maturity Treasuries are looking like an increasingly crowded trade, potentially adding energy to any sell-off\n\n&gt; On balance, our view remains that the prospect of an economic rebound over the second half points to the potential for interest rates moving higher. At the same time, we still see some advantage in the potential diversification benefits of intermediate maturity high-quality bonds, especially during periods of market stress. We continue to recommend that suitable investors consider keeping a bond portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates below that of the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index by emphasizing short to intermediate maturity bonds, but do not believe it\u2019s time to pile into very short maturities despite the 10-year Treasury yield sitting at historically low levels.\n\n*****\n\n# U.S. Jobs Growth Marches On\n\n&gt; While stock markets continue to be extremely volatile as they come to terms with how the coronavirus may affect global growth, the U.S. job market has remained remarkably robust. Continued U.S. jobs data resilience in the face of headwinds from the coronavirus outbreak may be a key factor in prolonging the expansion, given how important the strength of the U.S. consumer has been late into this expansion.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Department of Labor today reported that U.S. nonfarm payroll data had a strong showing of 273,000 jobs added in February, topping the expectation of every Bloomberg-surveyed economist, with an additional upward revision of 85,000 additional jobs for December 2019 and January 2020. This has brought the current unemployment rate back to its 50-year low of 3.5%. So far, it appears it\u2019s too soon for any effects of the coronavirus to have been felt in the jobs numbers. (Note: The survey takes place in the middle of each month.)\n\n&gt; On Wednesday, ADP released its private payroll data (excluding government jobs), which increased by 183,000 in February, also handily beating market expectations. Most of these jobs were added in the service sector, with 44,000 added in the leisure and hospitality sector, and another 31,000 in trade/transportation/utilities. Both of these areas could be at risk of potential cutbacks if consumers start to avoid eating out or other leisure pursuits due to coronavirus fears.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, payrolls remain strong, and any effects of the virus outbreaks most likely would be felt in coming months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/US-Jobs-Data.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFebruary\u2019s jobs report shows the 113th straight month that the U.S. jobs market has grown,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s an incredible run and highlights how the U.S. consumer has become key to extending the expansion, especially given setbacks to global growth from the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d\n\n&gt; While there is bound to be some drag on future jobs data from the coronavirus-related slowdown, we would anticipate that the effects of this may be transitory. We believe economic fundamentals continue to suggest the possibility of a second-half-of-the\u2013year economic rebound.\n\n*****\n\n# Down January &amp; Down February: S&amp;P 500 Posts Full-Year Gain Just 43.75% of Time\n\n&gt; The combination of a down January and a down February has come about 17 times, including this year, going back to 1950. Rest of the year and full-year performance has taken a rather sizable hit following the previous 16 occurrences. March through December S&amp;P 500 average performance drops to 2.32% compared to 7.69% in all years. Full-year performance is even worse with S&amp;P 500 average turning to a loss of 4.91% compared to an average gain of 9.14% in all years. All hope for 2020 is not lost as seven of the 16 past down January and down February years did go on to log gains over the last 10 months and full year while six enjoyed double-digit gains from March to December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/781e034df22d242349ff3f8882653cec/b4f07d98317a2635-4d/s500x750/0ea61b1c01085e74593633995acba59fe8a96ce8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Take Caution After Emergency Rate Cut\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s big rally was an encouraging sign that the markets are becoming more comfortable with the public health, monetary and political handling of the situation. But the history of these \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201csurprise\u201d rate cuts by the Fed between meetings suggest some caution remains in order.\n\n&gt; The table here shows that these surprise cuts between meetings have really only \u201cworked\u201d once in the past 20+ years. In 1998 when the Fed and the plunge protection team acted swiftly and in a coordinated manner to stave off the fallout from the financial crisis caused by the collapse of the Russian ruble and the highly leveraged Long Term Capital Management hedge fund markets responded well. This was not the case during the extended bear markets of 2001-2002 and 2007-2009.\n\n&gt; Bottom line: if this is a short-term impact like the 1998 financial crisis the market should recover sooner rather than later. But if the economic impact of coronavirus virus is prolonged, the market is more likely to languish.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd9ae8723eaf077f8baa56e384c8d8f7/e543b6eee32cdf93-81/s500x750/0f2b63108953c1e4cfb97da0a979d4ab3651cdeb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$DKS**\n&gt; * **$AVGO** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$WORK** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$DOCU** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$CLDR** \n&gt; * **$INSG** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$BTAI** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$HEAR** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$ADDYY** \n&gt; * **$GPS** \n&gt; * **$AKBA** \n&gt; * **$PDD** \n&gt; * **$CYOU** \n&gt; * **$FNV** \n&gt; * **$MTNB** \n&gt; * **$NERV** \n&gt; * **$MTN** \n&gt; * **$BEST** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$NINE** \n&gt; * **$AZUL** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$PRPL** \n&gt; * **$VSLR** \n&gt; * **$KLZE** \n&gt; * **$ZUO** \n&gt; * **$DVAX** \n&gt; * **$EXPR** \n&gt; * **$VRA** \n&gt; * **$AXSM** \n&gt; * **$CDMO** \n&gt; * **$CASY**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MY5URDI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Fq1ixYG.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3QxCDMd.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/kG5Cja7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWb2ADY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SH8bsTn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PH2Inly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RToRF8p.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HECD2g3.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvEJ9Vw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $336.77\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.
