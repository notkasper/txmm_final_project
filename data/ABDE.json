    "Hi All - Do you have any of the following or any other market lead companies in your radar to buy during the looming market crash and if yes, any suggestion on what will be good entry point to buy these stocks as the market keeps sliding down? Would be awesome if we can understand your thought process behind the conclusion as well! Following are some stocks that I want to invest in with a hope I will be getting them at a discount due to unfortunate events that is unfolding in front of our eyes due to Corona Virus. Note: This investment is outside my 401k investment which remains at 70-30 stock to bond ratio as my retirement is at least 15 years away which will continue to be funded on a business as usual basis.\n\nGroup A \n- AAPL\n- AMZN\n- BRK.B\n- DIS\n- GOOG\n- FB\n- JPM\n- MA\n- MSFT\n- QCOM\n- SBUX\n- WM\n- WMT\n\nGroup B\n- ABDE\n- AMD\n- COST\n- CRM\n- EQIX\n- ILMN\n- INTU\n- LMT\n- NOW\n- OKTA\n- PYPL\n- SHOP\n- VEEV\n- WDAY\n\nHope you and your family are safe, well, and taking precautions during COVID-19 season.
