Some good fades yesterday as well as some good dip buys. Price action reacting with follow through in both directions providing good opportunities in both directions, long and short.

Thoughts on whether I should sell any of these to consolidate? Primarily long term investor (5-10 year+)\n\nAAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMD, ENPH, SEDG, FTNT, AMZN, CHGG, TTWO, CHE, ALXN, VEEV, VRTX, MDT, ISRG, COST, LULU, ADBE, BIIB, EQIX, TMO\n\nAlso have about 15% in a S&amp;P ETF\n\nI tried picking stocks primarily on strong balance sheets and financials.
