I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Year-end Santa rally could depend on the big week ahead for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/congres-fe.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is so jam-packed for markets that it could determine whether there will be a smooth glide path for a Santa rally into the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; First, Congress looks set to fight down to the wire about a pandemic stimulus package, and chances are good it could again disappoint. The Fed also holds its final meeting of the year, and market pros are split on whether it will tweak its bond buying program when it issues its statement Wednesday. Since there\u2019s a divided view, there\u2019s room for market reaction either way.\n*****\n&gt; Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.\n*****\n&gt; Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&amp;P 500 at Friday\u2019s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility \u2014 the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don\u2019t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don\u2019t get one,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThe tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut you can\u2019t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Tesla revving up the S&amp;P\n&gt; Tesla\u2019s entry into the S&amp;P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&amp;P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday\u2019s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know if it creates volatility. It\u2019s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,\u201d said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cGiven we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn\u2019t take much to see the VIX spike.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to create more noise,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&amp;P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P.\n*****\n&gt; Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&amp;P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,\u201d Bartolini said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt will be exciting. You\u2019re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.\n*****\n&gt; There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn\u2019t do,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. \u201cThat has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663. Treasury yields moved higher in the past week but retrenched Friday, when the 10-year sank below 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; # Window on the economy\n&gt; There\u2019s a busy economic calendar in the week ahead. Weekly claims Thursday are expected to be closely watched after a surprise jump in people seeking new benefits for the week ending Dec. 5.\n*****\n&gt; November Markit PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors are released Wednesday, as is the November retail sales report.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said he is watching to see how much the services sector is being impacted by the spreading pandemic and related shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the economic data is being overlooked for better or worse because it\u2019s pre-vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the economy is slowing and the labor market has been weakening, particularly since the virus spread has continued to accelerate. Some expect the first quarter to be weaker than the fourth quarter, but activity should pick up in the second quarter as the vaccine is distributed.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/2S0NcDWd/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8vWKDYz/alphatrends1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/L6BpPf6b/finvizfuts.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/5Q2G6MV.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR3gStWM/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Vv8hsGML/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jdjX6YsY/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jGGBSNx/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eOWZhrG.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LxpLHIm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/643dART.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Not All Bad for Small Business\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released their monthly reading on the small business sector. With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.\n\n&gt; As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.\n\n&gt; For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.\n\n&gt; We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Empl.png))**\n\n&gt; Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.\n\n&gt; In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**\n\n&gt; Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.\n\n&gt; Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Expan.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders\n\n&gt; The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/1210-Mega.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish\n\n&gt; For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bullish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**\n\n&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bearish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bearish.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bulls.

The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.\n\n&gt; Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/35feeda338d979bfb6b6f25b3156fb4d/11fa20ff3c6ff3a3-4b/s500x750/454472c6c7d32c04ce9ec7e2e0ca7c045dab183d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is Inflation Looming?\n\n&gt; The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and \u201ccore\u201d readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we\u2019ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.\n\n&gt; \u201cCongress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in today\u2019s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Wb0yKPBF/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oxA4VQw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sO15Y4c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jQE7QFL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8q2wpXy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/f4M4FMw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D6W4j8k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dGlrSdg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $289.47\n**FedEx Corp.

Option traders are pricing in a 7.4% move on earnings and the stock has averaged a 2.9% move in recent quarters.\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=LEN&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 964928, "public", "self", "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kbsm8f/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "all_ads", 6, 1607789245.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bigbear0083", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_eaak0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1607792845, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kbsm8f/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "gildings": {}, "id": "kbsm8f", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "news", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "866eb162-65e6-11e5-a903-1252b640afe9", "link_flair_text": "News", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/kbsm8f/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "TRD4dv6SRzCnO053t4P4tBlgfjB77hwkIgnMEMM5WDI", "resolutions": [{"height": 66, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Qnmwye2GVwxVha5-uly8YcVZEVpZNVgqXPcYQ6nHgMo.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af75b4a01aaf3db5ce5fb915022e338808cd6f98", "width": 108}, {"height": 132, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Qnmwye2GVwxVha5-uly8YcVZEVpZNVgqXPcYQ6nHgMo.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5ecde2f54eb0cd071b9f739ef202c480cf2ab76", "width": 216}, {"height": 196, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Qnmwye2GVwxVha5-uly8YcVZEVpZNVgqXPcYQ6nHgMo.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7543195a4693317f7caacc4a57a88d347e586f2", "width": 320}, {"height": 393, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Qnmwye2GVwxVha5-uly8YcVZEVpZNVgqXPcYQ6nHgMo.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7961b42f5d27b6c8b5b6ef204ad0a99cf9dc0bc5", "width": 640}, {"height": 590, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Qnmwye2GVwxVha5-uly8YcVZEVpZNVgqXPcYQ6nHgMo.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b516b0f61665dd5f249e90888010f5024b4e9b28", "width": 960}, {"height": 664, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Qnmwye2GVwxVha5-uly8YcVZEVpZNVgqXPcYQ6nHgMo.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bdf6c07ad0e4ce91d0736f5f1e5370af29d0316", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 757, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Qnmwye2GVwxVha5-uly8YcVZEVpZNVgqXPcYQ6nHgMo.png?auto=webp&amp;s=a7b2c9bd5ba33dbf853354d4af11dbc956460300", "width": 1231}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1607792856, "score": 1, "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Year-end Santa rally could depend on the big week ahead for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/congres-fe.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is so jam-packed for markets that it could determine whether there will be a smooth glide path for a Santa rally into the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; First, Congress looks set to fight down to the wire about a pandemic stimulus package, and chances are good it could again disappoint. The Fed also holds its final meeting of the year, and market pros are split on whether it will tweak its bond buying program when it issues its statement Wednesday. Since there\u2019s a divided view, there\u2019s room for market reaction either way.\n*****\n&gt; Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.\n*****\n&gt; Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&amp;P 500 at Friday\u2019s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility \u2014 the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don\u2019t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don\u2019t get one,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThe tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut you can\u2019t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Tesla revving up the S&amp;P\n&gt; Tesla\u2019s entry into the S&amp;P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&amp;P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday\u2019s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know if it creates volatility. It\u2019s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,\u201d said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cGiven we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn\u2019t take much to see the VIX spike.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to create more noise,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&amp;P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P.\n*****\n&gt; Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&amp;P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,\u201d Bartolini said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt will be exciting. You\u2019re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.\n*****\n&gt; There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn\u2019t do,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. \u201cThat has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663. Treasury yields moved higher in the past week but retrenched Friday, when the 10-year sank below 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; # Window on the economy\n&gt; There\u2019s a busy economic calendar in the week ahead. Weekly claims Thursday are expected to be closely watched after a surprise jump in people seeking new benefits for the week ending Dec. 5.\n*****\n&gt; November Markit PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors are released Wednesday, as is the November retail sales report.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said he is watching to see how much the services sector is being impacted by the spreading pandemic and related shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the economic data is being overlooked for better or worse because it\u2019s pre-vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the economy is slowing and the labor market has been weakening, particularly since the virus spread has continued to accelerate. Some expect the first quarter to be weaker than the fourth quarter, but activity should pick up in the second quarter as the vaccine is distributed.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/2S0NcDWd/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8vWKDYz/alphatrends1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/L6BpPf6b/finvizfuts.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/5Q2G6MV.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR3gStWM/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Vv8hsGML/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jdjX6YsY/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jGGBSNx/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eOWZhrG.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LxpLHIm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/643dART.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Not All Bad for Small Business\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released their monthly reading on the small business sector. With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.\n\n&gt; As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.\n\n&gt; For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.\n\n&gt; We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Empl.png))**\n\n&gt; Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.\n\n&gt; In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**\n\n&gt; Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.\n\n&gt; Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Expan.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders\n\n&gt; The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/1210-Mega.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish\n\n&gt; For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bullish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**\n\n&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bearish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bearish.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bulls. As shown below, for both the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys, the bull-bear spreads are at historically high levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bull-bear.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Spread.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rally To Resume Mid-Month - Typical December Seasonal Pattern\n\n&gt; For the most part, this December has unfolded in rather typical seasonal fashion. The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.\n\n&gt; Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/35feeda338d979bfb6b6f25b3156fb4d/11fa20ff3c6ff3a3-4b/s500x750/454472c6c7d32c04ce9ec7e2e0ca7c045dab183d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is Inflation Looming?\n\n&gt; The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and \u201ccore\u201d readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we\u2019ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.\n\n&gt; \u201cCongress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in today\u2019s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Wb0yKPBF/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oxA4VQw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sO15Y4c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jQE7QFL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8q2wpXy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/f4M4FMw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D6W4j8k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dGlrSdg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $289.47\n**FedEx Corp.

Currently I'm just indexing with a TDF in a roth ira, but in my brokerage I think it could be good to learn to pick individual stocks. Currently I know on the technical side momentum usually carries a stock higher, but that's about it. On the fundamental side I know a bit more, lower PE ratio (compared with sector) is usually good, you generally want the company to be profitable, you want to see earnings increasing year by year and also maybe dividends rising (as long as company is earning enough to offset the dividend). \n\nMy core question is, how do you get from the point of discovering a stock, (I've found a few I like, like AMAT, and INTC, and also know of the usual players like DIS, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, APPL, etc.) to pulling the trigger?

Currently I'm just indexing with a TDF in a roth ira, but in my brokerage I think it could be good to learn to pick individual stocks. Currently I know on the technical side momentum usually carries a stock higher, but that's about it. On the fundamental side I know a bit more, lower PE ratio (compared with sector) is usually good, you generally want the company to be profitable, you want to see earnings increasing year by year and also maybe dividends rising (as long as company is earning enough to offset the dividend). \n\nMy core question is, how do you get from the point of discovering a stock, (I've found a few I like, like AMAT, and INTC, and also know of the usual players like DIS, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, APPL, etc.) to pulling the trigger? I only have around 200-300$ to play around with so it's not a huge deal if I lose it to learn, but how do I assess whether a stock is a good buy or not.

The Russell 2000 outperformed by (+3.57%). The Dow ended in positive territory at (+2.92%)\n* The best performing sector was Energy(+14.29%) while Communication Services(-0.88%)was the worst performer.\n* The energy (+14.2%) and financials (+8.2%) sectors finished comfortably atop the leaderboard, aided by noticeably higher oil prices ($40.31, +3.17, +8.5%) and curve-steepening activity caused by selling in longer-dated Treasuries. The consumer discretionary (-1.6%), information technology (-0.7%), consumer staples (-0.5%), and communication services (-0.3%) sectors closed lower. \n* The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.18%, while the 10-yr yield increased 11 basis points to 0.96%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.6% to 92.82. \n* In other important news, Joe Biden was projected the winner of the U.S. presidential election, although President Trump did not concede and said he would file legal challenges. Note, media reports indicated that Mr. Trump would unlikely succeed in overturning the election results. \n* It's worth mentioning that at one point today, the S&amp;P 500 was up as much as 11.5% over the prior six sessions. Presumably, that left it primed for profit taking amid an understanding that the market still has to get through the new wave of coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding another stimulus package.  \n## Index Summary\n **S&amp;P 500 :** (+1.25%); **NasDaq :** (-2.13%); \\\n**Russell 2000 :** (+3.57%); **Dow :** (+2.92%); \\\n**Vix :** 24.86 (+3.26%); [-30.86%]; {-23.03%} \n## Sectors Summary \n_Three highest sectors for today were -_ \n **Energy:** (+14.29%); **Financials:** (+8.15%); **Industrials:** (+3.37%)\n _Three lowest sectors for today were -_\n **Communication Services:** (-0.88%); **Information Technology:** (-0.75%); **Consumer Discretionary:** (-0.45%)\n ## Commodities/Futures \\\n_**Top 5 Highest Commodity % Changes \u2013 -**_ \\\n\n1\\.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 10th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets could be challenged by Washington stimulus talks and China tensions  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/07/markets-could-be-challenged-by-washington-stimulus-talks-and-china-tensions.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The debate in Washington over the next round of fiscal stimulus and rising tensions between the White House and China could act as brakes on the stock market in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rallied in the past week but were more sluggish Friday, as investors watched stimulus talks between Democrats and the Trump administration stall out. Investors also were concerned that President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning U.S. transactions with Tencent\u2019s We Chat and Bytedance\u2019s Tik Tok would accelerate the deterioration of relations between the U.S. and China and draw retribution.\n*****\n&gt; Just ahead of Friday\u2019s market close, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said just that he is recommending the White House move forward with executive orders on unemployment, student loans and rental foreclosures. He said a compromise could not be reached with Democrats, who wanted a $2 trillion package. Stocks edged higher after the announcement though details of the orders and how any assistance could be funded were unclear.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to bring the Democrats back to the table to negotiate a deal by threatening to use an executive order. They may be able to get some things down, but it won\u2019t be enough to create the bridge they need while the economy continues to repair itself,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 2.4% for the week, ending at 3,351, after a 2 point gain Friday. The Nasdaq was down 0.9% Friday, ending at 11,010. It was up 2.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPart of the reason stocks have held in there well and continue to melt up is that one of the things that is priced in is a fifth fiscal policy package of $1.5 trillion. if we don\u2019t get one, I do think the market will retrace lower to reflect a lack of stimulus,\u201d said Arone. \u201cThe recovery will stall out without one.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; As for China, it has so far not taken actions against U.S. companies, even with the Trump administration\u2019s moves to block Chinese telecom giant Huawei from using U.S. parts. The latest steps, however, raised concerns that China could find ways to retaliate, and that the U.S. will bar Chinese IPOs.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn balance, continued hostility toward China is going to be a continued net negative for U.S. companies that are revenue exposed to China,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG. \u201cWe know the exposure is very centered in the Nasdaq names.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the stock market is entering a seasonally weak time, and while market psychology is still strong it could start to change. \u201cThe seasonals are starting to shift negatively. We all know September is a poor month and the degree of the escalation of the tensions between the U.S. in China is not a surprise, but the degree of the escalation over the last 48 hours is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not changing psychology, but it\u2019s challenging bullish psychology.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, there are some final earnings of the season, including technology company Cisco and food company Sysco. Some travel companies including Royal Caribbean report, as does consumer goods company Tapestry. In the week after, big retailers roll out their reports in the final earnings burst of the quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Economic reports could be important in the coming week, as investors watch consumer price index inflation data Wednesday and retail sales Friday. Retail sales should provide a window into the consumer, as workers returned to their jobs but also faced uncertainty because of reclosings.\n*****\n&gt; CPI is important as the market has been assuming inflation will ultimately start to show gains because of the weakening dollar and ballooning budget deficits. CPI last month showed a 0.6% increase month over month.\n*****\n&gt; The pro-inflation trade has become important and has driven investors into stocks, gold, and out of the dollar.\n*****\n&gt; # Watch this trade\nThe dollar could be the key to the fate of markets in the coming week. The U.S. currency was edging higher Friday but is still down about 3.5% over the past four weeks. Gold declined Friday, and Treasury yields moved lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe dollar ... to me it just continues to be an important barometer that has a unique intersection of rates, inflation and risk assets,\u201d said Arone. \u201cWith rising China, U.S. tensions and combined with the fact that there\u2019s uncertainty about the fiscal policy package and the fact the dollar has declined so quickly, many are expecting it to catch a bid here and rebound.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Part of the move in the dollar was based on the idea that huge government spending would increase the government\u2019s deficit and Treasury issuance. Emanuel said the news on stimulus could have a big impact on the trade.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe would make the argument the baseline expectation was a trillion dollars worth of stimulus to be implemented sometime in the month of August. Anything below that expectation is likely to cause the dollar to strengthen,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cIt\u2019s a momentum and positioning trade as well as what has been ... the unwind of an asset diversification trade.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The stalling of talks could shift the market\u2019s view that the U.S. is willing to spend any amount to fight the impact of the coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s changing the market psychology that the government\u2019s propensity to spend infinitely is not as great as it was earlier in the week,,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cThe dollar rallying, from our perspective, is a direct threat to a lot of these momentum trades.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said a strengthening dollar could be a headwind for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGiven the friction with China, to the extent the inflation numbers come in weaker than expected, the argument being that whole weaker dollar asset diversification has helped feed into increasing inflation expectations,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cIf the inflation data does surprise to the downside, given the rally in inflation ...it\u2019s further potential for the unwinding of the short dollar trade and the unwinding of the long gold trade which in our view bleeds over into stocks.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Hd63ibb.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/JB5lwYJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/QGdJU9H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/wMC2Lp9B/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ohAnmHN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gbbisXK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/IRn34qI.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1lbSlRY.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/v2nYSz6.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C1gBrzCq/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/TYFPHKf3/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/KvRzNPXW/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/ryhsxhHW/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Individual Investors Still Don't Believe\n\n&gt; As mentioned in a prior post, in the past week the S&amp;P 500 has moved within 2% of its 2/19 high, but at the same time, less than a quarter of AAII respondents are optimistic for the future of stocks over the next six months. That begs the question- if there have been past times that sentiment and price action have been so detached from one another. Since the start of the AAII survey in 1987, there have been 10 periods (including the current one) in which the S&amp;P 500 was within 2% of an all-time high but bullish sentiment was less than 25% without another occurrence in the prior three months. The most recent prior occurrence was not even a full year ago. Back in October, sentiment was only slightly higher as the S&amp;P 500 was 1.84% from its all-time high. Prior to that, there were some scattered instances throughout 2013, 2015, and 2016 but before that, you would have to go back to 1993 to find another similar period. The one occurrence in 2013 stands out as it was both the lowest sentiment reading of these prior occurrences and the only one that occurred with the S&amp;P 500 right at an all-time high.\n\n&gt; As for where things stand after such instances, sentiment has tended to reverse higher in the following six months as the S&amp;P 500 has tended to move higher. The S&amp;P 500 has actually tended towards better than average returns over the next three months, although performance six months out has been modestly worse than average, even as it has been higher more often than not. Additionally, as shown in the second chart below, of the more recent occurrences of the past decade, they haven't marked any major top or bottom for the S&amp;P 500 with occurrences clustered both coming off of lows and in the middle of longer-term uptrends.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-AAII-and-SP-500-within-2-table.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-AAII-and-SP-500.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Silver Takes the Gold\n\n&gt; Gold and silver prices were already on a tear heading into this week, but they've only seen their gains accelerate even more. With more than a day and a half of trading left in the week, front-month gold futures have rallied, but silver has been the real show stopper with a gain of 16%!\n\n&gt; Taking a look at a one-year chart of silver over the last year, things have really gone parabolic this week as the front-month futures contract is trading more than 40% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and 62% above its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Silver.png))**\n\n&gt; Were it not for the move in silver, gold's move would be getting all the attention. Prices for gold have also seen a major surge in the last month, rising from under $1,800 to the current level of $2,060 per ounce. While not as extended as silver, gold currently trades 14% above its 50-DMA and 26% above its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Gold.png))**\n\n&gt; With gold 25.7% above its 200-DMA and silver 62.2% above, the average spread of the two commodities currently stands at 44.3%. In the 40+ year history of the two futures contracts, there have only been a handful of prior periods where the average spread of the two commodities was larger or even above 35% for that matter with the most recent occurring back in early 2011. This recent rally in the two commodities has certainly been one for the ages.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Gold-Silver-Combined35.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Moves Off 52-Week Lows\n\n&gt; Within the US equity market, we've seen some major moves in individual stocks off their 52-week lows over the last few months. Look at the table below. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the performance of the largest companies in the US, stocks in the index are up an average of 87.6% from their respective 52-week lows. Looking at performance by individual sectors, stocks in the Energy sector are up an average of 136.8%, while the average Consumer Discretionary stock has rallied 131.4%. The Technology sector wasn't hit nearly as hard by the Covid-crash as other sectors, but stocks in the sector have doubled on an average basis relative to their 52-week lows. The only sector where stocks are up less than 50% on an average basis from their 52-week lows is Utilities at 46.33%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080520-Rusell-1000-change-from-52-week-low.png))**\n\n&gt; For many investors, the holy grail of stock picking is the proverbial ten-bagger. A ten-bagger is a stock that multiplies by ten times its original price. Usually, this happens over the span of years, but in the Covid-economy, we've actually seen a number of these ten-baggers play out in the span of months. While most of these examples are in the small-cap space, shares of Wayfair (W), which has a current market cap of $27.5 billion, have rallied from $21.70 on March 19th to its current price of $290.85 now. That's a gain of more than 1,200% in less than five months!\n\n&gt; Within the entire Russell 1,000, 257 stocks have at least doubled off their 52-week lows, and in the table below we highlight the 34 stocks that are at least a quarter of the way to the ten-bagger club and have rallied more than 250%. As mentioned above, W tops the list, but Fastly (FSLY), which has barely been public for a year, is just shy of the club with a gain of 992%. Behind FSLY, Livongo Health (LVGO) is up 855%. Given that LVGO just got a takeover offer from Teladoc (TDOC), the 11th best-performing stock on the list, it may only make the ten-bagger club under the banner of the TDOC ticker.\n\n&gt; In looking through the list of stocks shown, many of these names come from the Health Care, Technology, and Consumer Discretionary sectors and have been direct beneficiaries of the new Covid-economy. At the same time, six stocks from the Energy sector made the list as well as they recovered from their bombed-out levels after oil prices briefly traded in negative territory earlier this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080520-Rusell-1000-change-from-52-week-low-table-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far\n\n&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**\n\n&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/eps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Labor Market Continues Summer Momentum\n\n&gt; After falling the most on record in April, the US labor market has rebounded with three consecutive months of job gains, adding back more than 9 million of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April. In July, the economy added back nearly 1.8 million jobs, ahead of Bloomberg consensus estimates for 1.5 million and lowering the unemployment rate from 11.1% to 10.2%, but lingering measurement issues could add 1% to that number, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, job gains were broad based across industries, with a third of the increase coming from the leisure and hospitality sector\u2014the \u201cscene of the accident\u201d industries\u2014while only information, and mining and logging posted declines in July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.7.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMarch and April were historically brutal months for the labor market, but the labor market\u2019s resiliency this summer has been a welcome development,\u201d stated LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cHowever, the next few months will be critical for the economy as schools reopen and additional fiscal stimulus still hangs in the balance.\u201d\n\n&gt; The July report also comes on the heels of a rise in COVID-19 cases across the Sunbelt region of the United States. Because of the date of the survey, it may not fully reflect the economic impact of some of the more recent high-frequency data that has captured some of the effect of rising cases. Still, the jobs report shows that the US economy is continuing to heal despite the long road ahead.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are Recessions Good For Stocks?\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t like any recession we\u2019ve ever seen, as it was sparked by a horrible pandemic and happened because people were told to stay inside. The impact was the worst contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) last quarter that anyone who is reading this has ever seen. But what is quite surprising is the fact the Nasdaq has made 30 all-time highs so far in 2020, while the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained four consecutive months, all while the unemployment rate remains above 10%.\n\n&gt; Why is this happening? There are two main schools of thought. One is that stocks are forecasting a better economy later this year and into 2021; remember, stocks tend to lead the economy and could be doing so once again. Another school of thought is that the massive fiscal and monetary policy are boosting equity prices, while not helping the overall economy quite as much.\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s the catch. It actually isn\u2019t abnormal to see stocks gain during a recession. \u201cThis is one that might surprise many people, but stocks have actually gained during 7 of the past 12 recessions,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThere\u2019s no question the difference between what is happening on Wall Street compared with Main Street is about as wide as we\u2019ve ever seen, but maybe it shouldn\u2019t be as big of a surprise that stocks have been strong.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 actually gained 1.3% on average when looking at the 12 previous recessions going back to World War II, with a very impressive median advance of 5.7% (the average is skewed lower due to 2008). We continue to expect this recession to end soon, if it isn\u2019t over already. In fact, when the end of the recession is officially declared at a later date, we could have yet another recession that saw stock market gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.5.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NIO** \n&gt; * **$MELI** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$RCL** \n&gt; * **$DKNG** \n&gt; * **$MAR** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$MARK** \n&gt; * **$PRTK** \n&gt; * **$JMIA** \n&gt; * **$DUK** \n&gt; * **$SPG** \n&gt; * **$ON** \n&gt; * **$HUYA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$SEAS** \n&gt; * **$ICPT** \n&gt; * **$PRPL** \n&gt; * **$LYFT** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$FOLD** \n&gt; * **$CEVA** \n&gt; * **$DOYU** \n&gt; * **$SYY** \n&gt; * **$SDGR** \n&gt; * **$GOOS** \n&gt; * **$TTOO** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$TNK** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$GRWG**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/v2nYSz6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mjhw2qX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR MONDAY, AUGUST 10TH, 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/NHhXB13.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/H67Mg1J.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5DIQO1B.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RgQdixH.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdVRiJu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tuCqkCk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RqbAmnt.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pZjdCyt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ni20iSQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DgPcij6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LcirLAw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.14.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NIO Inc. $13.42\n&gt; **NIO Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 10th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets could be challenged by Washington stimulus talks and China tensions  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/07/markets-could-be-challenged-by-washington-stimulus-talks-and-china-tensions.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The debate in Washington over the next round of fiscal stimulus and rising tensions between the White House and China could act as brakes on the stock market in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rallied in the past week but were more sluggish Friday, as investors watched stimulus talks between Democrats and the Trump administration stall out. Investors also were concerned that President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning U.S. transactions with Tencent\u2019s We Chat and Bytedance\u2019s Tik Tok would accelerate the deterioration of relations between the U.S. and China and draw retribution.\n*****\n&gt; Just ahead of Friday\u2019s market close, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said just that he is recommending the White House move forward with executive orders on unemployment, student loans and rental foreclosures. He said a compromise could not be reached with Democrats, who wanted a $2 trillion package. Stocks edged higher after the announcement though details of the orders and how any assistance could be funded were unclear.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to bring the Democrats back to the table to negotiate a deal by threatening to use an executive order. They may be able to get some things down, but it won\u2019t be enough to create the bridge they need while the economy continues to repair itself,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 2.4% for the week, ending at 3,351, after a 2 point gain Friday. The Nasdaq was down 0.9% Friday, ending at 11,010. It was up 2.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPart of the reason stocks have held in there well and continue to melt up is that one of the things that is priced in is a fifth fiscal policy package of $1.5 trillion. if we don\u2019t get one, I do think the market will retrace lower to reflect a lack of stimulus,\u201d said Arone. \u201cThe recovery will stall out without one.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; As for China, it has so far not taken actions against U.S. companies, even with the Trump administration\u2019s moves to block Chinese telecom giant Huawei from using U.S. parts. The latest steps, however, raised concerns that China could find ways to retaliate, and that the U.S. will bar Chinese IPOs.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn balance, continued hostility toward China is going to be a continued net negative for U.S. companies that are revenue exposed to China,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG. \u201cWe know the exposure is very centered in the Nasdaq names.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the stock market is entering a seasonally weak time, and while market psychology is still strong it could start to change. \u201cThe seasonals are starting to shift negatively. We all know September is a poor month and the degree of the escalation of the tensions between the U.S. in China is not a surprise, but the degree of the escalation over the last 48 hours is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not changing psychology, but it\u2019s challenging bullish psychology.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, there are some final earnings of the season, including technology company Cisco and food company Sysco. Some travel companies including Royal Caribbean report, as does consumer goods company Tapestry. In the week after, big retailers roll out their reports in the final earnings burst of the quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Economic reports could be important in the coming week, as investors watch consumer price index inflation data Wednesday and retail sales Friday. Retail sales should provide a window into the consumer, as workers returned to their jobs but also faced uncertainty because of reclosings.\n*****\n&gt; CPI is important as the market has been assuming inflation will ultimately start to show gains because of the weakening dollar and ballooning budget deficits. CPI last month showed a 0.6% increase month over month.\n*****\n&gt; The pro-inflation trade has become important and has driven investors into stocks, gold, and out of the dollar.\n*****\n&gt; # Watch this trade\nThe dollar could be the key to the fate of markets in the coming week. The U.S. currency was edging higher Friday but is still down about 3.5% over the past four weeks. Gold declined Friday, and Treasury yields moved lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe dollar ... to me it just continues to be an important barometer that has a unique intersection of rates, inflation and risk assets,\u201d said Arone. \u201cWith rising China, U.S. tensions and combined with the fact that there\u2019s uncertainty about the fiscal policy package and the fact the dollar has declined so quickly, many are expecting it to catch a bid here and rebound.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Part of the move in the dollar was based on the idea that huge government spending would increase the government\u2019s deficit and Treasury issuance. Emanuel said the news on stimulus could have a big impact on the trade.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe would make the argument the baseline expectation was a trillion dollars worth of stimulus to be implemented sometime in the month of August. Anything below that expectation is likely to cause the dollar to strengthen,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cIt\u2019s a momentum and positioning trade as well as what has been ... the unwind of an asset diversification trade.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The stalling of talks could shift the market\u2019s view that the U.S. is willing to spend any amount to fight the impact of the coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s changing the market psychology that the government\u2019s propensity to spend infinitely is not as great as it was earlier in the week,,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cThe dollar rallying, from our perspective, is a direct threat to a lot of these momentum trades.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said a strengthening dollar could be a headwind for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGiven the friction with China, to the extent the inflation numbers come in weaker than expected, the argument being that whole weaker dollar asset diversification has helped feed into increasing inflation expectations,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cIf the inflation data does surprise to the downside, given the rally in inflation ...it\u2019s further potential for the unwinding of the short dollar trade and the unwinding of the long gold trade which in our view bleeds over into stocks.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Hd63ibb.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/JB5lwYJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/QGdJU9H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/wMC2Lp9B/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ohAnmHN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gbbisXK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/IRn34qI.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1lbSlRY.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/v2nYSz6.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C1gBrzCq/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/TYFPHKf3/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/KvRzNPXW/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/ryhsxhHW/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Individual Investors Still Don't Believe\n\n&gt; As mentioned in a prior post, in the past week the S&amp;P 500 has moved within 2% of its 2/19 high, but at the same time, less than a quarter of AAII respondents are optimistic for the future of stocks over the next six months. That begs the question- if there have been past times that sentiment and price action have been so detached from one another. Since the start of the AAII survey in 1987, there have been 10 periods (including the current one) in which the S&amp;P 500 was within 2% of an all-time high but bullish sentiment was less than 25% without another occurrence in the prior three months. The most recent prior occurrence was not even a full year ago. Back in October, sentiment was only slightly higher as the S&amp;P 500 was 1.84% from its all-time high. Prior to that, there were some scattered instances throughout 2013, 2015, and 2016 but before that, you would have to go back to 1993 to find another similar period. The one occurrence in 2013 stands out as it was both the lowest sentiment reading of these prior occurrences and the only one that occurred with the S&amp;P 500 right at an all-time high.\n\n&gt; As for where things stand after such instances, sentiment has tended to reverse higher in the following six months as the S&amp;P 500 has tended to move higher. The S&amp;P 500 has actually tended towards better than average returns over the next three months, although performance six months out has been modestly worse than average, even as it has been higher more often than not. Additionally, as shown in the second chart below, of the more recent occurrences of the past decade, they haven't marked any major top or bottom for the S&amp;P 500 with occurrences clustered both coming off of lows and in the middle of longer-term uptrends.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-AAII-and-SP-500-within-2-table.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-AAII-and-SP-500.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Silver Takes the Gold\n\n&gt; Gold and silver prices were already on a tear heading into this week, but they've only seen their gains accelerate even more. With more than a day and a half of trading left in the week, front-month gold futures have rallied, but silver has been the real show stopper with a gain of 16%!\n\n&gt; Taking a look at a one-year chart of silver over the last year, things have really gone parabolic this week as the front-month futures contract is trading more than 40% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and 62% above its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Silver.png))**\n\n&gt; Were it not for the move in silver, gold's move would be getting all the attention. Prices for gold have also seen a major surge in the last month, rising from under $1,800 to the current level of $2,060 per ounce. While not as extended as silver, gold currently trades 14% above its 50-DMA and 26% above its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Gold.png))**\n\n&gt; With gold 25.7% above its 200-DMA and silver 62.2% above, the average spread of the two commodities currently stands at 44.3%. In the 40+ year history of the two futures contracts, there have only been a handful of prior periods where the average spread of the two commodities was larger or even above 35% for that matter with the most recent occurring back in early 2011. This recent rally in the two commodities has certainly been one for the ages.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Gold-Silver-Combined35.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Moves Off 52-Week Lows\n\n&gt; Within the US equity market, we've seen some major moves in individual stocks off their 52-week lows over the last few months. Look at the table below. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the performance of the largest companies in the US, stocks in the index are up an average of 87.6% from their respective 52-week lows. Looking at performance by individual sectors, stocks in the Energy sector are up an average of 136.8%, while the average Consumer Discretionary stock has rallied 131.4%. The Technology sector wasn't hit nearly as hard by the Covid-crash as other sectors, but stocks in the sector have doubled on an average basis relative to their 52-week lows. The only sector where stocks are up less than 50% on an average basis from their 52-week lows is Utilities at 46.33%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080520-Rusell-1000-change-from-52-week-low.png))**\n\n&gt; For many investors, the holy grail of stock picking is the proverbial ten-bagger. A ten-bagger is a stock that multiplies by ten times its original price. Usually, this happens over the span of years, but in the Covid-economy, we've actually seen a number of these ten-baggers play out in the span of months. While most of these examples are in the small-cap space, shares of Wayfair (W), which has a current market cap of $27.5 billion, have rallied from $21.70 on March 19th to its current price of $290.85 now. That's a gain of more than 1,200% in less than five months!\n\n&gt; Within the entire Russell 1,000, 257 stocks have at least doubled off their 52-week lows, and in the table below we highlight the 34 stocks that are at least a quarter of the way to the ten-bagger club and have rallied more than 250%. As mentioned above, W tops the list, but Fastly (FSLY), which has barely been public for a year, is just shy of the club with a gain of 992%. Behind FSLY, Livongo Health (LVGO) is up 855%. Given that LVGO just got a takeover offer from Teladoc (TDOC), the 11th best-performing stock on the list, it may only make the ten-bagger club under the banner of the TDOC ticker.\n\n&gt; In looking through the list of stocks shown, many of these names come from the Health Care, Technology, and Consumer Discretionary sectors and have been direct beneficiaries of the new Covid-economy. At the same time, six stocks from the Energy sector made the list as well as they recovered from their bombed-out levels after oil prices briefly traded in negative territory earlier this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080520-Rusell-1000-change-from-52-week-low-table-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far\n\n&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**\n\n&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/eps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Labor Market Continues Summer Momentum\n\n&gt; After falling the most on record in April, the US labor market has rebounded with three consecutive months of job gains, adding back more than 9 million of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April. In July, the economy added back nearly 1.8 million jobs, ahead of Bloomberg consensus estimates for 1.5 million and lowering the unemployment rate from 11.1% to 10.2%, but lingering measurement issues could add 1% to that number, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, job gains were broad based across industries, with a third of the increase coming from the leisure and hospitality sector\u2014the \u201cscene of the accident\u201d industries\u2014while only information, and mining and logging posted declines in July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.7.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMarch and April were historically brutal months for the labor market, but the labor market\u2019s resiliency this summer has been a welcome development,\u201d stated LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cHowever, the next few months will be critical for the economy as schools reopen and additional fiscal stimulus still hangs in the balance.\u201d\n\n&gt; The July report also comes on the heels of a rise in COVID-19 cases across the Sunbelt region of the United States. Because of the date of the survey, it may not fully reflect the economic impact of some of the more recent high-frequency data that has captured some of the effect of rising cases. Still, the jobs report shows that the US economy is continuing to heal despite the long road ahead.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are Recessions Good For Stocks?\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t like any recession we\u2019ve ever seen, as it was sparked by a horrible pandemic and happened because people were told to stay inside. The impact was the worst contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) last quarter that anyone who is reading this has ever seen. But what is quite surprising is the fact the Nasdaq has made 30 all-time highs so far in 2020, while the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained four consecutive months, all while the unemployment rate remains above 10%.\n\n&gt; Why is this happening? There are two main schools of thought. One is that stocks are forecasting a better economy later this year and into 2021; remember, stocks tend to lead the economy and could be doing so once again. Another school of thought is that the massive fiscal and monetary policy are boosting equity prices, while not helping the overall economy quite as much.\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s the catch. It actually isn\u2019t abnormal to see stocks gain during a recession. \u201cThis is one that might surprise many people, but stocks have actually gained during 7 of the past 12 recessions,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThere\u2019s no question the difference between what is happening on Wall Street compared with Main Street is about as wide as we\u2019ve ever seen, but maybe it shouldn\u2019t be as big of a surprise that stocks have been strong.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 actually gained 1.3% on average when looking at the 12 previous recessions going back to World War II, with a very impressive median advance of 5.7% (the average is skewed lower due to 2008). We continue to expect this recession to end soon, if it isn\u2019t over already. In fact, when the end of the recession is officially declared at a later date, we could have yet another recession that saw stock market gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.5.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NIO** \n&gt; * **$MELI** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$RCL** \n&gt; * **$DKNG** \n&gt; * **$MAR** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$MARK** \n&gt; * **$PRTK** \n&gt; * **$JMIA** \n&gt; * **$DUK** \n&gt; * **$SPG** \n&gt; * **$ON** \n&gt; * **$HUYA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$SEAS** \n&gt; * **$ICPT** \n&gt; * **$PRPL** \n&gt; * **$LYFT** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$FOLD** \n&gt; * **$CEVA** \n&gt; * **$DOYU** \n&gt; * **$SYY** \n&gt; * **$SDGR** \n&gt; * **$GOOS** \n&gt; * **$TTOO** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$TNK** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$GRWG**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/v2nYSz6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mjhw2qX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR MONDAY, AUGUST 10TH, 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/NHhXB13.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/H67Mg1J.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5DIQO1B.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RgQdixH.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdVRiJu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tuCqkCk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RqbAmnt.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pZjdCyt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ni20iSQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DgPcij6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LcirLAw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.14.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NIO Inc. $13.42\n&gt; **NIO Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 11th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks are expected to trade the economy\u2019s reopening in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/stocks-expected-to-trade-the-economys-reopening-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors will watch the economy\u2019s reopening progress, as well as a series of economic reports in the coming week that will provide a look at the consumer during April as the economy shed 20.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on a webcast held by the Peterson Institute on Wednesday at 9 a.m., and he will be watched closely for any new insights on the economy or Fed programs.\n*****\n&gt; There are just a few earnings releases ahead, but there will be a barrage of economic reports, including consumer and producer inflation, consumer sentiment and most importantly retail sales on Friday. \n*****\n&gt; # Stocks versus bonds\n&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, even as some bond yields touched record lows. Yields move opposite price, and bonds usually move opposite stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe stock market is trading the reopening, and the bond market is doubting the vibrant pace of an economic recovery upon the reopening,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; Small cap stocks and tech led the way higher in the past week. The Nasdaq jumped 6% in a week, where it wiped out its losses for the year and turned positive. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 5.5%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.5% for the week to 2,929, with tech up 6.6% and consumer discretionary stocks up 4.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The bond market and stock market have both responded to the Fed\u2019s programs that put more liquidity into the financial system, with bond rates falling and stocks rising sharply.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cStocks just seem to be disconnected from everything else,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo. Some bond yields, like the benchmark 10-year yield, which impacts many types of loans, were slightly higher ahead of the Treasury\u2019s record $96 billion in auctions in the coming week. But the 2-year, at a new low of 0.10%, was trading on concerns about the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Market pros will look for Powell to comment on market speculation that the Fed could take its benchmark rate to a negative yield. Fed officials have said they have no interest in negative rates, which are being used by central banks in Europe and Japan. But for the first time this past week, traders drove futures on fed funds to show slightly negative rates in contracts starting in  November. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cHe could quash negative yields if he wants to,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cThe Fed has consistently argued against negative policy rates. Now there\u2019s a chance Powell could comment on this. He\u2019s commented about it, several times in the last six months.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Much of the gains in the stock market have been driven by big technology companies with operations that haven\u2019t been deeply affected by the coronavirus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTech was the shutdown trade and small caps are the reopening,\u201d said Boockvar, noting small caps are domestically focused and are sensitive to the back-to-work trade.\n*****\n&gt; Apple joined the reopening trade Friday, when its stock rose after it announced it would reopen some of its U.S. stores.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe stock market has sort of a hall pass as the months proceed and things reopen. At some point, that hall pass is going to expire\u201d and the reopenings will have to result in rebound, Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; Investors have been watching for anything that suggests state reopenings are stimulating activity.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales Friday will be a big focus and are expected to show sharp decline of 11%, but more like 6% when automobiles and gasoline are removed, he said.\n*****\n&gt; In the oil market in the past week, crude was up as much as 24% as traders reacted to information that showed gasoline demand picking up around the U.S. States have been opening up at different speeds, and California was the latest to reopen some activity Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome of the reason the market is up because the virus curve is bending, the economic data is showing signs of a bounce. It hasn\u2019t here yet but you know it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s a global phenomenon,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. He noted that China\u2019s export numbers unexpectedly rose in April, for the first time this year.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he expects stocks to remain in an upswing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of value out there if you\u2019re outside the high growth in the S&amp;P 500,\u201d he said, \u201cWhen fear is as high as it is, that\u2019s typically been a great time to lean toward risk assets. Gold is at a 50-year high relative to commodity prices. People are buying bonds at virtually zero yield. To me, there\u2019s fairly defensive behavior and scared attitudes rather than the other way around.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market could retest its March lows, but a good number say the bottom has been set.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m getting more confident that we\u2019ve seen the lows, and we\u2019re starting a recovery in the stock market, but I think the volatility is going to stay there, and there will be challenges. I think the general direction is up rather than down at the moment,\u201d said Paulsen.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said the fear of reinfection remains, should there be a new wave of the virus. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of terrible things that could happen and be terrible for the stock market,\u201d he said.  \u201cA headline could create an up or down week and then go away again. \u201d \n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the rise in the stock market is really more about a lack of sellers. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of buyers. If more people believed this is winding down ... there could be a  lot more money that\u2019s going to come back into equities, to some extent,\u201d Paulsen said.\n*****\n&gt; Market pros are keeping an eye on yields, ahead of the government\u2019s record sized $96 billion in auctions in the coming week for 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4HGQyi7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/2lmIrzt.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/eEihRrS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DR6SfIc.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fXS8KN3.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8V6CfZy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VHY2OWA.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/G3fxr2S.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sx0HDsl.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/udABitD.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zujuIT6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/PxZA6w2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market Too Far Ahead of Economy?\n\n&gt; Another 3.2 million Americans filed for unemployment last week bringing the seven-week total to 33.5 million. This is an unprecedented streak for an unprecedented time, and it highlights the significant impact that the coronavirus pandemic shutdown is having. One small positive aspect of this week\u2019s number is the fact that it is a decline from the previous reading which lends further support to the possibility that the market\u2019s lows of March could be the bottom and that bottom could hold based upon the historical correlation of jobless claims and past market bottoms that we covered in a recent post.\n\n&gt; However, the seven-week total is an unsettling number that suggests the road back to \u201cnormal\u201d could be longer than the market appears to currently expect. It is getting increasingly more challenging to envision 33.5 million Americans returning to work as quickly as they left. And with NASDAQ returning to positive for the year in today\u2019s trading it may be time to wonder if the market\u2019s brisk recovery is possibly too far ahead of the actual economy.\n\n&gt; One early sign that the rally may be getting well ahead of the economy can be seen in the following chart of cumulative daily advance/decline lines for NYSE, NASDAQ, Russell 2000 and the S&amp;P 500. The recent trend since the end of April has been lower while the indexes have managed to move modestly higher. This suggests that fewer and fewer stocks are still participating in the rally. Historically when this persisted the major indexes frequently failed to move meaningfully higher and often turned lower.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ff6838e7d4a8493b62fad589a840223/2faca2fd2c71ed13-d0/s500x750/93ab9274fcf5f85882ed91b1eeb70ec5bcc54b88.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market Gains in Celebration of Mother\u2019s Day\n\n&gt; With just a few days remaining to Mother\u2019s Day, today\u2019s post is also a reminder. Over the last twenty-five years on the Friday before Mother\u2019s Day the Dow Jones Industrials have gained ground seventeen times. On the Monday after, DJIA has advanced seventeen times over the same time period. Average gain on Friday has been 0.20% and a respectable 0.36% on Monday. However, in five of the last eight years, the Monday following Mother\u2019s Day has been down. Last year, DJIA suffered its worst post Mother\u2019s Day loss, off 2.38%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/91ef736cb31d1b665b1933aa28dc680c/577c38f8de114a58-46/s500x750/e29f63d6af8b2ae4a172b03a5a3ba2af28fe345b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Group Breadth Improving From a Record Low Base\n\n&gt; After a disastrous late February and early March period, breadth among S&amp;P 500 groups cratered to the point where not a single one of the S&amp;P 500's 24 industry groups were above their 50-day moving average. Before the most recent occurrence, that's something we hadn't seen since early 2019.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-above-520DMA.png))**\n\n&gt; While there have been numerous instances in the last few years where every industry group was below its 50-DMA, the most recent period was unique in that it lasted more than four full weeks (21 trading days). Going all the way back to 1990, there has only been one other period where every industry group was below its 50-day moving average for as long as it just was. That was during the depths of the financial crisis in the 21-day stretch ending 11/3/08. It took a bear market of more than a year to finally reach that level back then, but this time around, it took less than two months. Besides that period, there has never been another four-week stretch where every industry group was below its 50-day moving average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-above-520DMA-Streaks.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall breadth readings have already improved in terms of industry groups above their 50-day moving averages, but at this point, the number of industry groups with rising 50-day moving averages remains extremely depressed at just 8.3% as of midday Friday. Similar to the streak above, during the most recent period every group had a declining 50-day moving average for 26 straight days, and that was also the longest such streak since 2008. Granted, this is a lagging indicator and should improve the longer equities remain around current levels, but it once again serves as a reminder of how steep the declines actually were.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-rising-50DMA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Sector Relative Strength\n\n&gt; Although the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is down around 1% over the past week, there are two sectors that have made a push higher: Communication Services (XLC) and Technology (XLK). While these moves have left both sectors in overbought territory, a snapshot from our Trend Analyzer tool shows that Tech's rally has brought it into the green YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050720-TA.png))**\n\n&gt; Technology's outperformance is nothing new. As shown in the relative strength charts from our Sector Snapshot below, Technology has been a serial outperformer versus the S&amp;P 500 for pretty much all of the past year (a rising line indicates outperformance versus the S&amp;P 500 and vice versa). As for the other sectors, Health Care has also seen some drastic outperformance over the past few months. Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary have also seen some outperformance in recent weeks. Contrary to Technology, Energy, Financials, Industrials, and Materials have all been consistent underperformers over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/RS.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Performance on Earnings Days\n\n&gt; Roughly 1,300 companies have reported since the start of earnings season on 4/13 when the first of the big banks kicked things off. For those stocks that have beaten EPS estimates, the reaction has not been as strong as past years with just a 9 bps difference between this earnings season and all seasons since 2001. On the other hand, those that have missed EPS have not been as badly punished dropping 0.86% compared to an average drop of 3.56% since 2001. For all stocks, the average gain of 0.79% this earnings season is much stronger than the 0.06% gain of all other seasons.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/Earn-React-4.png))**\n\n&gt; With stock price reactions being generally positive this season, most of the gain has come at the open. Stocks reporting earnings have gapped up an average of 1.24%. But intraday they have tended to sell-off, averaging a 0.44% decline from open to close.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/Earn-React-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$UAA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$MAR** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$CPE** \n&gt; * **$JD** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$KOS** \n&gt; * **$ON** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$CAH** \n&gt; * **$ACB** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$WIX** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$NCLH** \n&gt; * **$DUK** \n&gt; * **$NBEV**\n&gt; * **$ICPT** \n&gt; * **$SPG** \n&gt; * **$CYBR** \n&gt; * **$DDOG** \n&gt; * **$CEVA** \n&gt; * **$MYL** \n&gt; * **$CHH** \n&gt; * **$HMC** \n&gt; * **$ET** \n&gt; * **$LOGI** \n&gt; * **$OAS** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$ZBH** \n&gt; * **$PRTK** \n&gt; * **$ABUS** \n&gt; * **$GWPH** \n&gt; * **$VCTR** \n&gt; * **$SALT** \n&gt; * **$WVE** \n&gt; * **$GNC** \n&gt; * **$AMRX** \n&gt; * **$ETR** \n&gt; * **$NOG**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sx0HDsl.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/SeXyhoI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/dp54bLF.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NOhb3L5.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GVcHqQw.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/II5ukMy.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1RbrpI3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FrASNRG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tZs8hms.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GwtxPwV.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jUwjUuj.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s2yx68v.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ofgb6gF.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.15.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ofgb6gF.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Under Armour, Inc. $9.98\n&gt; **Under Armour, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 11th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks are expected to trade the economy\u2019s reopening in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/stocks-expected-to-trade-the-economys-reopening-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors will watch the economy\u2019s reopening progress, as well as a series of economic reports in the coming week that will provide a look at the consumer during April as the economy shed 20.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on a webcast held by the Peterson Institute on Wednesday at 9 a.m., and he will be watched closely for any new insights on the economy or Fed programs.\n*****\n&gt; There are just a few earnings releases ahead, but there will be a barrage of economic reports, including consumer and producer inflation, consumer sentiment and most importantly retail sales on Friday. \n*****\n&gt; # Stocks versus bonds\n&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, even as some bond yields touched record lows. Yields move opposite price, and bonds usually move opposite stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe stock market is trading the reopening, and the bond market is doubting the vibrant pace of an economic recovery upon the reopening,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; Small cap stocks and tech led the way higher in the past week. The Nasdaq jumped 6% in a week, where it wiped out its losses for the year and turned positive. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 5.5%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.5% for the week to 2,929, with tech up 6.6% and consumer discretionary stocks up 4.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The bond market and stock market have both responded to the Fed\u2019s programs that put more liquidity into the financial system, with bond rates falling and stocks rising sharply.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cStocks just seem to be disconnected from everything else,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo. Some bond yields, like the benchmark 10-year yield, which impacts many types of loans, were slightly higher ahead of the Treasury\u2019s record $96 billion in auctions in the coming week. But the 2-year, at a new low of 0.10%, was trading on concerns about the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Market pros will look for Powell to comment on market speculation that the Fed could take its benchmark rate to a negative yield. Fed officials have said they have no interest in negative rates, which are being used by central banks in Europe and Japan. But for the first time this past week, traders drove futures on fed funds to show slightly negative rates in contracts starting in  November. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cHe could quash negative yields if he wants to,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cThe Fed has consistently argued against negative policy rates. Now there\u2019s a chance Powell could comment on this. He\u2019s commented about it, several times in the last six months.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Much of the gains in the stock market have been driven by big technology companies with operations that haven\u2019t been deeply affected by the coronavirus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTech was the shutdown trade and small caps are the reopening,\u201d said Boockvar, noting small caps are domestically focused and are sensitive to the back-to-work trade.\n*****\n&gt; Apple joined the reopening trade Friday, when its stock rose after it announced it would reopen some of its U.S. stores.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe stock market has sort of a hall pass as the months proceed and things reopen. At some point, that hall pass is going to expire\u201d and the reopenings will have to result in rebound, Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; Investors have been watching for anything that suggests state reopenings are stimulating activity.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales Friday will be a big focus and are expected to show sharp decline of 11%, but more like 6% when automobiles and gasoline are removed, he said.\n*****\n&gt; In the oil market in the past week, crude was up as much as 24% as traders reacted to information that showed gasoline demand picking up around the U.S. States have been opening up at different speeds, and California was the latest to reopen some activity Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome of the reason the market is up because the virus curve is bending, the economic data is showing signs of a bounce. It hasn\u2019t here yet but you know it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s a global phenomenon,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. He noted that China\u2019s export numbers unexpectedly rose in April, for the first time this year.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he expects stocks to remain in an upswing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of value out there if you\u2019re outside the high growth in the S&amp;P 500,\u201d he said, \u201cWhen fear is as high as it is, that\u2019s typically been a great time to lean toward risk assets. Gold is at a 50-year high relative to commodity prices. People are buying bonds at virtually zero yield. To me, there\u2019s fairly defensive behavior and scared attitudes rather than the other way around.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market could retest its March lows, but a good number say the bottom has been set.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m getting more confident that we\u2019ve seen the lows, and we\u2019re starting a recovery in the stock market, but I think the volatility is going to stay there, and there will be challenges. I think the general direction is up rather than down at the moment,\u201d said Paulsen.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said the fear of reinfection remains, should there be a new wave of the virus. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of terrible things that could happen and be terrible for the stock market,\u201d he said.  \u201cA headline could create an up or down week and then go away again. \u201d \n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the rise in the stock market is really more about a lack of sellers. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of buyers. If more people believed this is winding down ... there could be a  lot more money that\u2019s going to come back into equities, to some extent,\u201d Paulsen said.\n*****\n&gt; Market pros are keeping an eye on yields, ahead of the government\u2019s record sized $96 billion in auctions in the coming week for 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4HGQyi7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/2lmIrzt.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/eEihRrS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DR6SfIc.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fXS8KN3.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8V6CfZy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VHY2OWA.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/G3fxr2S.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sx0HDsl.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/udABitD.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zujuIT6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/PxZA6w2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market Too Far Ahead of Economy?\n\n&gt; Another 3.2 million Americans filed for unemployment last week bringing the seven-week total to 33.5 million. This is an unprecedented streak for an unprecedented time, and it highlights the significant impact that the coronavirus pandemic shutdown is having. One small positive aspect of this week\u2019s number is the fact that it is a decline from the previous reading which lends further support to the possibility that the market\u2019s lows of March could be the bottom and that bottom could hold based upon the historical correlation of jobless claims and past market bottoms that we covered in a recent post.\n\n&gt; However, the seven-week total is an unsettling number that suggests the road back to \u201cnormal\u201d could be longer than the market appears to currently expect. It is getting increasingly more challenging to envision 33.5 million Americans returning to work as quickly as they left. And with NASDAQ returning to positive for the year in today\u2019s trading it may be time to wonder if the market\u2019s brisk recovery is possibly too far ahead of the actual economy.\n\n&gt; One early sign that the rally may be getting well ahead of the economy can be seen in the following chart of cumulative daily advance/decline lines for NYSE, NASDAQ, Russell 2000 and the S&amp;P 500. The recent trend since the end of April has been lower while the indexes have managed to move modestly higher. This suggests that fewer and fewer stocks are still participating in the rally. Historically when this persisted the major indexes frequently failed to move meaningfully higher and often turned lower.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ff6838e7d4a8493b62fad589a840223/2faca2fd2c71ed13-d0/s500x750/93ab9274fcf5f85882ed91b1eeb70ec5bcc54b88.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market Gains in Celebration of Mother\u2019s Day\n\n&gt; With just a few days remaining to Mother\u2019s Day, today\u2019s post is also a reminder.

However, in five of the last eight years, the Monday following Mother\u2019s Day has been down. Last year, DJIA suffered its worst post Mother\u2019s Day loss, off 2.38%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/91ef736cb31d1b665b1933aa28dc680c/577c38f8de114a58-46/s500x750/e29f63d6af8b2ae4a172b03a5a3ba2af28fe345b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Group Breadth Improving From a Record Low Base\n\n&gt; After a disastrous late February and early March period, breadth among S&amp;P 500 groups cratered to the point where not a single one of the S&amp;P 500's 24 industry groups were above their 50-day moving average. Before the most recent occurrence, that's something we hadn't seen since early 2019.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-above-520DMA.png))**\n\n&gt; While there have been numerous instances in the last few years where every industry group was below its 50-DMA, the most recent period was unique in that it lasted more than four full weeks (21 trading days). Going all the way back to 1990, there has only been one other period where every industry group was below its 50-day moving average for as long as it just was. That was during the depths of the financial crisis in the 21-day stretch ending 11/3/08. It took a bear market of more than a year to finally reach that level back then, but this time around, it took less than two months. Besides that period, there has never been another four-week stretch where every industry group was below its 50-day moving average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-above-520DMA-Streaks.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall breadth readings have already improved in terms of industry groups above their 50-day moving averages, but at this point, the number of industry groups with rising 50-day moving averages remains extremely depressed at just 8.3% as of midday Friday. Similar to the streak above, during the most recent period every group had a declining 50-day moving average for 26 straight days, and that was also the longest such streak since 2008. Granted, this is a lagging indicator and should improve the longer equities remain around current levels, but it once again serves as a reminder of how steep the declines actually were.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-rising-50DMA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Sector Relative Strength\n\n&gt; Although the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is down around 1% over the past week, there are two sectors that have made a push higher: Communication Services (XLC) and Technology (XLK). While these moves have left both sectors in overbought territory, a snapshot from our Trend Analyzer tool shows that Tech's rally has brought it into the green YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050720-TA.png))**\n\n&gt; Technology's outperformance is nothing new. As shown in the relative strength charts from our Sector Snapshot below, Technology has been a serial outperformer versus the S&amp;P 500 for pretty much all of the past year (a rising line indicates outperformance versus the S&amp;P 500 and vice versa). As for the other sectors, Health Care has also seen some drastic outperformance over the past few months. Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary have also seen some outperformance in recent weeks. Contrary to Technology, Energy, Financials, Industrials, and Materials have all been consistent underperformers over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/RS.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Performance on Earnings Days\n\n&gt; Roughly 1,300 companies have reported since the start of earnings season on 4/13 when the first of the big banks kicked things off. For those stocks that have beaten EPS estimates, the reaction has not been as strong as past years with just a 9 bps difference between this earnings season and all seasons since 2001. On the other hand, those that have missed EPS have not been as badly punished dropping 0.86% compared to an average drop of 3.56% since 2001. For all stocks, the average gain of 0.79% this earnings season is much stronger than the 0.06% gain of all other seasons.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/Earn-React-4.png))**\n\n&gt; With stock price reactions being generally positive this season, most of the gain has come at the open. Stocks reporting earnings have gapped up an average of 1.24%. But intraday they have tended to sell-off, averaging a 0.44% decline from open to close.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/Earn-React-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$UAA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$MAR** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$CPE** \n&gt; * **$JD** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$KOS** \n&gt; * **$ON** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$CAH** \n&gt; * **$ACB** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$WIX** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$NCLH** \n&gt; * **$DUK** \n&gt; * **$NBEV**\n&gt; * **$ICPT** \n&gt; * **$SPG** \n&gt; * **$CYBR** \n&gt; * **$DDOG** \n&gt; * **$CEVA** \n&gt; * **$MYL** \n&gt; * **$CHH** \n&gt; * **$HMC** \n&gt; * **$ET** \n&gt; * **$LOGI** \n&gt; * **$OAS** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$ZBH** \n&gt; * **$PRTK** \n&gt; * **$ABUS** \n&gt; * **$GWPH** \n&gt; * **$VCTR** \n&gt; * **$SALT** \n&gt; * **$WVE** \n&gt; * **$GNC** \n&gt; * **$AMRX** \n&gt; * **$ETR** \n&gt; * **$NOG**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sx0HDsl.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/SeXyhoI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/dp54bLF.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NOhb3L5.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GVcHqQw.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/II5ukMy.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1RbrpI3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FrASNRG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tZs8hms.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GwtxPwV.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jUwjUuj.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s2yx68v.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ofgb6gF.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.15.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ofgb6gF.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Under Armour, Inc. $9.98\n&gt; **Under Armour, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks face headwinds as investors look forward to a big earnings week, a Fed meeting and state reopenings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/stocks-face-headwinds-as-investors-look-forward-to-a-big-earnings-week-a-fed-meeting-and-state-reopenings.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The stock market is struggling to make headway, as a big week of events rolls around, including a Federal Reserve meeting, the first look at post-shutdown economic growth and earnings from more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s a busy week for earnings, and some of the biggest blue chips are likely to join the growing list of companies withdrawing guidance amid the uncertainty of how the coronavirus and shutdowns are impacting their business. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald\u2019s are among about 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&amp;P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia\u2019s plan to reopen.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it\u2019s a fundamental story,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said it\u2019s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that\u2019s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. \u201cPeople are watching what\u2019s going on in places like Georgia, but they\u2019re also watching what\u2019s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s really one thing that really matters. It\u2019s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed bazooka\n&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it\u2019s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what\u2019s working and the things that still need to happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tilley said the Fed\u2019s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. \u201cIt looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they\u2019ve come back in,\u201d he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank\u2019s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said this Fed meeting isn\u2019t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they\u2019re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re borrowing from a bank or whether you\u2019re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Economic impact\n&gt; First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.\n*****\n&gt; Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.\n*****\n&gt; The impact of that should show up in Friday\u2019s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,\u201d Tilley said.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings\n&gt; Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.\n*****\n&gt; An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It\u2019s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,\u201d said Golub. \u201cMy estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it\u2019s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that\u2019s too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. \u201cWe had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that\u2019s really bad.\u201d Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3vJvFZR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/B4Di7Fh.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/7XXBq3H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QyE3rll.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jyp5KqQ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fCYKkgg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PdPKvec.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sEY6EDm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QuCVREP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gkpOUiT.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GrUMf6m.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election-year Mays: DJIA\u2019s Second Worst Month\n\n&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fac23214c1353f0b68d7710f6f7886a1/2eed74513d6bc154-86/s400x600/2540f531fb63ceab611b44ad7e0a2c0165670319.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective\n\n&gt; One month ago today the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We\u2019ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we\u2019ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&amp;P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Picture-4.23.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we\u2019ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?\n\n&gt; \u201cThis remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Market-returns-4.20.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020\n\n&gt; The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy has performed so far this year.\n\n&gt; The \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.\n\n&gt; As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.\n\n&gt; Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far\n\n&gt; We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.\n\n&gt; As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/avgearn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators\n\n&gt; Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity index started off the week coming in at \u20134.19 which was well below estimates of \u20133. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)\n\n&gt; The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&amp;P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.\n\n&gt; In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Other honorable mentions not on this list reporting next week include industrial bell-weather Caterpillar (CAT), stocks likely benefiting from the COVID economy like Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Clorox (CLX), and finally, some travel and leisure stocks like Expedia (EXPE), Royal Caribbean (RCL), United Airlines (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Earnings-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Bounces Right Where It Was Supposed To\n\n&gt; With central banks around the world unleashing waves of liquidity, there have been heightened concerns that one result will be a decline in the purchasing power of our money. For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.\n\n&gt; Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/042320-Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$CBSH** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$CHKP** \n&gt; * **$MRK** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$WHR** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$BP** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$CLX** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$CMS** \n&gt; * **$CNX** \n&gt; * **$APRN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lRp3xer.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Yw1LKpH.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HW4ersg.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KnhCH1m.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XeUrTNF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/20sK5un.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QXrGzmn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tSP1S0Y.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Sn4QllI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DhxQrOU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1CpjzdJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/raeflTF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/43jb0Pu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/axhdXpO.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wiL7F9e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HZkJ2ai.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.

Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald\u2019s are among about 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&amp;P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia\u2019s plan to reopen.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it\u2019s a fundamental story,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said it\u2019s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that\u2019s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. \u201cPeople are watching what\u2019s going on in places like Georgia, but they\u2019re also watching what\u2019s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s really one thing that really matters. It\u2019s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed bazooka\n&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it\u2019s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what\u2019s working and the things that still need to happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tilley said the Fed\u2019s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. \u201cIt looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they\u2019ve come back in,\u201d he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank\u2019s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said this Fed meeting isn\u2019t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they\u2019re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re borrowing from a bank or whether you\u2019re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Economic impact\n&gt; First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.\n*****\n&gt; Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.\n*****\n&gt; The impact of that should show up in Friday\u2019s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,\u201d Tilley said.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings\n&gt; Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.\n*****\n&gt; An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It\u2019s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,\u201d said Golub. \u201cMy estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it\u2019s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that\u2019s too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. \u201cWe had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that\u2019s really bad.\u201d Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3vJvFZR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/B4Di7Fh.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/7XXBq3H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QyE3rll.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jyp5KqQ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fCYKkgg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PdPKvec.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sEY6EDm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QuCVREP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gkpOUiT.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GrUMf6m.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election-year Mays: DJIA\u2019s Second Worst Month\n\n&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fac23214c1353f0b68d7710f6f7886a1/2eed74513d6bc154-86/s400x600/2540f531fb63ceab611b44ad7e0a2c0165670319.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective\n\n&gt; One month ago today the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We\u2019ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we\u2019ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&amp;P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Picture-4.23.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we\u2019ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?\n\n&gt; \u201cThis remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Market-returns-4.20.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020\n\n&gt; The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy has performed so far this year.\n\n&gt; The \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.\n\n&gt; As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.\n\n&gt; Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far\n\n&gt; We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.\n\n&gt; As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/avgearn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators\n\n&gt; Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity index started off the week coming in at \u20134.19 which was well below estimates of \u20133. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)\n\n&gt; The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&amp;P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.\n\n&gt; In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Other honorable mentions not on this list reporting next week include industrial bell-weather Caterpillar (CAT), stocks likely benefiting from the COVID economy like Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Clorox (CLX), and finally, some travel and leisure stocks like Expedia (EXPE), Royal Caribbean (RCL), United Airlines (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Earnings-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Bounces Right Where It Was Supposed To\n\n&gt; With central banks around the world unleashing waves of liquidity, there have been heightened concerns that one result will be a decline in the purchasing power of our money. For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.\n\n&gt; Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/042320-Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$CBSH** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$CHKP** \n&gt; * **$MRK** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$WHR** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$BP** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$CLX** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$CMS** \n&gt; * **$CNX** \n&gt; * **$APRN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lRp3xer.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Yw1LKpH.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HW4ersg.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KnhCH1m.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XeUrTNF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/20sK5un.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QXrGzmn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tSP1S0Y.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Sn4QllI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DhxQrOU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1CpjzdJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/raeflTF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/43jb0Pu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/axhdXpO.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wiL7F9e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HZkJ2ai.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.

Tesla posted 10 consecutive weekly gains and have risen 127% over that span. (CNBC)\n* China\u2019s National Health Commission said it confirmed 3,062 new coronavirus cases and 97 additional deaths, mostly in Hubei province. The government said a total of 40,171 cases have been confirmed and 908 people have died in the country.

Josh Hawley is proposing putting the Federal Trade Commission, an independent agency, within the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch. The proposal is likely to raise alarms about removing the independence of a key regulatory body, especially as Democrats have speculated about Attorney General William Barr\u2019s closeness to Trump. (CNBC)\n* Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the leader of Germany\u2019s Christian Democratic Union and the expected successor of Angela Merkel, will not run for chancellor. She will also give up the leadership of the CDU in the summer, according to an unnamed source cited by Reuters, setting in motion a party leadership contest. (CNBC)\n* L Brands (LB) is nearing a deal to sell its Victoria\u2019s Secret brand to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal that could be announced as soon this week. It\u2019s not clear what role L Brands CEO Les Wexner would have in such a deal, as he\u2019s under mounting pressure due to his ties to the late sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein.

Tesla posted 10 consecutive weekly gains and have risen 127% over that span. (CNBC)\n* China\u2019s National Health Commission said it confirmed 3,062 new coronavirus cases and 97 additional deaths, mostly in Hubei province. The government said a total of 40,171 cases have been confirmed and 908 people have died in the country.

Josh Hawley is proposing putting the Federal Trade Commission, an independent agency, within the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch. The proposal is likely to raise alarms about removing the independence of a key regulatory body, especially as Democrats have speculated about Attorney General William Barr\u2019s closeness to Trump. (CNBC)\n* Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the leader of Germany\u2019s Christian Democratic Union and the expected successor of Angela Merkel, will not run for chancellor. She will also give up the leadership of the CDU in the summer, according to an unnamed source cited by Reuters, setting in motion a party leadership contest. (CNBC)\n* L Brands (LB) is nearing a deal to sell its Victoria\u2019s Secret brand to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal that could be announced as soon this week. It\u2019s not clear what role L Brands CEO Les Wexner would have in such a deal, as he\u2019s under mounting pressure due to his ties to the late sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein.

But by Friday, the death of the doctor who discovered the illness and the addition of restrictions in Shenzen, a key manufacturing hub, were among the headlines that renewed investor fears. By Friday, 31,000 people were reported to be infected, mostly in China, but the amount of new cases slowed for a second day, according to the World Health Organization.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were lower Friday even after a much stronger-than-expected January employment report showed 225,000 jobs were created \u2014 65,000 more than expected. Treasury yields, higher much of the week, edged lower Friday, and the 10-year yield dipped below 1.60% once more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe data has been very positive, but it\u2019s looking in the rear view mirror. It doesn\u2019t take into account any concerns about the coronavirus yet,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts have said volatility will now be a common theme in the stock market, regardless of which way it trades. That may have been apparent in the story of one stock in the past week \u2014 Tesla.\n*****\n&gt; The electric car maker\u2019s stock shot up in parabolic fashion to a high of $968.99 on Tuesday, and was trading more than $200 below that on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI do believe what happened in Tesla just does show some of the euphoria that got into the marketplace,\u201d said Matt Maley, Miller Tabak chief market strategist. Maley said some investors were comparing the surge higher to 1999, when the tech bubble was building. \u201cI really laugh when people justify the rally by saying, it\u2019s not as crazy as it was in 1999.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Maley said now that the stock has \u201cwashed out\u201d on the upside, there\u2019s likely more downside ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome of these comments in the last couple of days ... talking about how the retail investors piled into the stock. Of course, that\u2019s usually a sign of a top as well,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Brakes on growth\n&gt; UBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele said next week could provide an important look at how the virus is impacting China\u2019s economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week, Chinese factories are set to reopen after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, and important indicators to note will be to what extent the virus spreads as people resume travel back to work, and how long it takes for production to return to full capacity,\u201d he wrote, adding he still likes emerging markets despite the potential hit on their economies.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the impact on the U.S. economy to be minimal, and say it should bounce back quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Thursday\u2019s consumer price index and Friday\u2019s retail sales, industrial production and consumer sentiment will be watched closely by economists. ISM manufacturing data was stronger than expected in the past week, ending a period of contraction that started during the trade war.\n*****\n&gt; The first quarter data has been providing a mixed picture of the economy, ahead of any impacts of the virus. Economists had been expecting manufacturing to get a boost after the trade deal, but Boeing\u2019s production shut down and now the virus could muddy that picture.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s been a little bit of chicken little about the economy for awhile. It ebbs and flows,\u201d said Arone, noting the Fed is the backstop if growth is choked. \u201cMost of the indicators indicate the economy is going to chug along.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell testifies for two days before House and Senate committees on the state of the economy. Markets will be watching his comments closely to see what he has to say on the potential impact of the coronavirus. The markets have begun to price in more than one rate cut for this year, even though the Fed is not forecasting any.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWith the strong jobs, I think it\u2019s going to be more of the same. They raised the bar pretty high for them to signal any policy changes,\u201d said John Roberts, U.S. rate strategist at NatWest Markets. \u201cThey mentioned the coronavirus already. We could get more insight into what they\u2019re thinking about that. That\u2019s the main thing we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s central bank has been adding stimulus, and that was seen as a booster for global stock markets in the past week.\n*****\n&gt; Capital Economics on Friday said it expects the coronavirus to cost the world economy $280 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf we\u2019re right, then this will mean that global GDP will not grow in [quarter over quarter] terms for the first time since 2009,\u201d the economists wrote in a note. \u201cWe assume the virus will be contained soon, and that lost output is made up in subsequent quarters, so that world GDP reaches the level it would have done had there been no outbreak by the middle of 2021.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings Bonanza\n&gt; Better-than-expected earnings have helped stoke the market\u2019s recent gains. There are dozens of earnings expected in the week ahead, including CVS Health Wednesday and Pepsi, Nvidia and Kraft Heinz Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; So far, more than 70% of companies are beating forecasts and profits are growing by 2.3%, when including both companies that have reported and those expected to report, according to Refinitiv. At the start of the earnings reporting period, earnings growth was expected to decline.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts will also look to companies to continue disclosing how the virus is impacting their operations. VF Corp, for instance, said 60% of its stores in China are now closed, and those that remain open have serous declines.\n*****\n&gt; # Playing Politics\n&gt; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sent a shudder through markets when he began to rise in the polls ahead of Iowa\u2019s caucuses. But the chaos in declaring a winner in Iowa this past week, leaves the Democratic field wide open. So New Hampshire\u2019s primary Tuesday will also be important.\n*****\n&gt; The left-leaning Sanders is viewed as negative for the stock market, but his main rivals, Joseph Biden and now Pete Buttigieg, who seems to have led in Iowa, are both moderates. Sanders leads in the New Hampshire polls and is expected to win his neighboring state.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s going to continue to matter for quite some time, until we get clarity at least on who the Democratic candidate is going to be,\u201d said Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO. \u201d[Buttigieg] would be much more business friendly than some of the other candidates. Does that make him more or less electable? If he\u2019s more that could be a market negative development.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has gained 55% since Donald Trump became president, and analysts say he is viewed by investors as having the best policies for the stock market. Some Democrats, particularly Sanders, would raise taxes sharply.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qOqI74J.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/n8uJhuY.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/qSPsa54.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yKvMhID.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qFnHyJw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Zwtq6za.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Crf7CiP.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSa5dB3.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8e4snrC.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O4BbZMh.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4df33Zh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YwquWUG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/nJe64uF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Week Before Presidents\u2019 Day Bullish since 1990\n\n&gt; Page 100 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 points out Presidents\u2019 Day as the poorest performing holiday of the eight holidays that are tracked. Unlike the others, the trading day before and the trading day after this three-day holiday weekend are both down on average over the past 40 years. However, the full week before the long holiday weekend has a bullish record. Since 1990 DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 20 times with average weekly gains of 0.66% and 0.48% respectively. NASDAQ has one additional weekly decline while Russell 2000 has been the strongest, up 23 times with an average gain of 0.79%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/87d4499ef13ff59956f4c6343e3c411e/5b2bbadb398d5a54-f0/s500x750/24f2f57a33d656e400f05e96ccd367ce42aa6af8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Strong Jobs Report to Begin 2020\n\n&gt; U.S. hiring came in stronger than expected in January, rebounding from a disappointing December print.\n\n&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose by 225,000 in January, far surpassing Bloomberg\u2019s consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released today by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This number may help alleviate some investor unease over December\u2019s somewhat weak reading. We argued at the time that December\u2019s reading likely was due in large part to calendar effects and the volatility of month-to-month changes. We prefer to base our views of the labor market\u2019s vitality on the larger trend, which, has been undeniably strong, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kciking-off-2020-with-a-strong-rebound.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some investors have questioned how long hiring can remain elevated before we experience a worker shortage or a sharp rise in wages. The answer, according to this report, is not yet.\n\n&gt; In addition to the strong hiring numbers, workers also have enjoyed healthy wage gains. January saw average hourly earnings rise 3.1% year over year, a slight pickup from December, while average hours worked remained unchanged. \u201cToday\u2019s wage number exceeds inflation, meaning workers are growing their purchasing power in real terms and should be able to continue increasing their consumption of goods and services,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cBut the number is also lower than the 4% threshold that has historically signaled an overheating job market and potential for subsequent economic and market volatility. This is a very encouraging report.\u201d\n\n&gt; The one slight blip in today\u2019s release showed the unemployment rate inching 0.1% higher to 3.6%. This was mainly due to changes to the size of the labor force, which affected revisions. Still, given the extremely low unemployment level, the volatility of month-to-month numbers, and the overwhelmingly positive tone of the other data points released today, we feel confident about the prospects for the U.S. consumer to continue powering this economic expansion through 2020 and beyond.\n\n*****\n\n# New Highs Tilt Scales to Bulls\n\n&gt; China is cutting tariffs; the impeachment process has come to an end and the market is at new all-time highs. The coronavirus is still a concern, but apparently not as much as it was less than one week ago. Progress has been made. Official emergency declarations have mobilized a stronger response. China has quickly built additional hospitals and work is underway on a treatment. Gilead (GILD) appears to be the first to offer a potential cure although its drug remdesivir has not been approved to cure any disease yet. These recent developments along with solid earnings, have been the fuel to reverse the market\u2019s late January retreat in just a few trading sessions this month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb99cd5eedf67e83954c998976da3a81/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-49/s500x750/705cf31363591f72784f14fed6029effc84a4228.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/07db71096c88ddf9778d29d0bdb69e60/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-86/s500x750/e6f5479d3cea9759bc52d0c99fff7704947ff575.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdb9b967be268f1fcb154d09dfa8553b/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-2c/s500x750/4f3021be20791991f739de9273300f798a7cbf31.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In the above charts, the market\u2019s strength since October can be seen along with second half of January weakness. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have remained comfortably above their respective 200-day moving averages since October. In January only DJIA actually (and briefly) closed below its even higher 50-day moving average. The market\u2019s rebound surge in February has also reversed negative readings from Stochastic, relative strength and MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; Momentum clearly favors the bulls and January\u2019s negative finish remains unconfirmed as of today. As long as economic data and corporate earnings remain positive then the market is likely to continue the trend that has been in place since last October, higher. There are likely to be some dips along the way with the next possible soft patch arriving when earnings season nears its end later this month and/or in the first half of March.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical February Trading: Tepid Month with Solid Mid-Month Rally\n\n&gt; February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&amp;P 500 has averaged a measly 0.1%. Over the last 21-year period S&amp;P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of 0.4% in February. February\u2019s first trading day has historically been good, like today, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been rather lacking.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/10b0e0be07d6824e6a082e13a26bc1d9/e1ddcea381248255-b9/s500x750/a2b1e806df3ec07b5e77c69efd297e5802fa1208.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Does A Lower January Have Bears Smiling?\n\n&gt; Stocks got off to a nice start in 2020, until the late January selloff due to the coronavirus outbreak fears. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell only 0.2% for the month, but it did mark the end to a 4-month win streak. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2020?\n\n&gt; There\u2019s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, \u201cAs goes January, so goes the year.\u201d This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?\n\n&gt; As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&amp;P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.2% on average over the final 11 months and were higher less than 60% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/so-goes-january-so-goes-the-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another way to look at this data shows the average full year return based on if stocks are higher in January or not. As you can clearly see, stocks have tended to have trouble gaining any traction over the rest of the year after a January loss, while a green January has been quite strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-january-barometer.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; It isn\u2019t all bad news though. Remember the S&amp;P 500 was down only 0.2% in January, so one could argue that it was really flat. \u201cYes, a lower January is a potential worry for the bulls,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut it is worth noting the previous 5 times (and 7 of 8) when stocks were lower in January, those final 11 months rallied. So this might not be the clear cut bearish signal so many think it is.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/a-lower-january-hasnt-been-as-bearish-lately.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Spoiled by Coronavirus\n\n&gt; The market decline on the last day of January spoiled what would have been the fourth consecutive January Trifecta. S&amp;P 500 finished January down 0.2% and thus the January Barometer was negative.\n\n&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.7% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .743 batting average.\n\n&gt; This year\u2019s combination of a positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days with a full-month January loss has only occurred eleven times (including this year) since 1950. In the previous ten occurrences S&amp;P 500 was down six times in February with an average loss of 1.5%. However, over the remaining 11 months of the year, S&amp;P 500 advanced 80% of the time with an average gain of 7.4%. Full-year performance was positive 70% of the time, but with an average gain of 2.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6df473ecb7e9c5b9c107222c65f3131a/7be8cdb3803e5a29-77/s500x750/284bbb2175287530e6f02fc233a1772dce7a4852.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 7th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.9.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$ROKU** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$CVS** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$UAA** \n&gt; * **$QSR** \n&gt; * **$L** \n&gt; * **$AGN** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$LYFT** \n&gt; * **$TEVA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$MCY** \n&gt; * **$SAFE** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$DO** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$D** \n&gt; * **$CYBR**\n&gt; * **$MELI** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$CNA** \n&gt; * **$EXAS** \n&gt; * **$GT** \n&gt; * **$HLT** \n&gt; * **$AYX** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$APPS** \n&gt; * **$WM** \n&gt; * **$GPN** \n&gt; * **$CRNT** \n&gt; * **$BIP** \n&gt; * **$YETI** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$LSCC** \n&gt; * **$RNG** \n&gt; * **$NMM** \n&gt; * **$JE**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tvfxbnh.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DYTRi0w.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sWB49z5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hiUR1ec.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w9FUjTz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cPnIcpa.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/BBaSJcZ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tjUpFdY.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/D7eo9EG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Y4rdLiL.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/feUqB85.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TGxgQ96.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tC78cWW.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. $216.53\n&gt; **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

Treasury yields, higher much of the week, edged lower Friday, and the 10-year yield dipped below 1.60% once more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe data has been very positive, but it\u2019s looking in the rear view mirror. It doesn\u2019t take into account any concerns about the coronavirus yet,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts have said volatility will now be a common theme in the stock market, regardless of which way it trades. That may have been apparent in the story of one stock in the past week \u2014 Tesla.\n*****\n&gt; The electric car maker\u2019s stock shot up in parabolic fashion to a high of $968.99 on Tuesday, and was trading more than $200 below that on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI do believe what happened in Tesla just does show some of the euphoria that got into the marketplace,\u201d said Matt Maley, Miller Tabak chief market strategist. Maley said some investors were comparing the surge higher to 1999, when the tech bubble was building. \u201cI really laugh when people justify the rally by saying, it\u2019s not as crazy as it was in 1999.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Maley said now that the stock has \u201cwashed out\u201d on the upside, there\u2019s likely more downside ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome of these comments in the last couple of days ... talking about how the retail investors piled into the stock. Of course, that\u2019s usually a sign of a top as well,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Brakes on growth\n&gt; UBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele said next week could provide an important look at how the virus is impacting China\u2019s economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week, Chinese factories are set to reopen after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, and important indicators to note will be to what extent the virus spreads as people resume travel back to work, and how long it takes for production to return to full capacity,\u201d he wrote, adding he still likes emerging markets despite the potential hit on their economies.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the impact on the U.S. economy to be minimal, and say it should bounce back quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Thursday\u2019s consumer price index and Friday\u2019s retail sales, industrial production and consumer sentiment will be watched closely by economists. ISM manufacturing data was stronger than expected in the past week, ending a period of contraction that started during the trade war.\n*****\n&gt; The first quarter data has been providing a mixed picture of the economy, ahead of any impacts of the virus. Economists had been expecting manufacturing to get a boost after the trade deal, but Boeing\u2019s production shut down and now the virus could muddy that picture.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s been a little bit of chicken little about the economy for awhile. It ebbs and flows,\u201d said Arone, noting the Fed is the backstop if growth is choked. \u201cMost of the indicators indicate the economy is going to chug along.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell testifies for two days before House and Senate committees on the state of the economy. Markets will be watching his comments closely to see what he has to say on the potential impact of the coronavirus. The markets have begun to price in more than one rate cut for this year, even though the Fed is not forecasting any.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWith the strong jobs, I think it\u2019s going to be more of the same. They raised the bar pretty high for them to signal any policy changes,\u201d said John Roberts, U.S. rate strategist at NatWest Markets. \u201cThey mentioned the coronavirus already. We could get more insight into what they\u2019re thinking about that. That\u2019s the main thing we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s central bank has been adding stimulus, and that was seen as a booster for global stock markets in the past week.\n*****\n&gt; Capital Economics on Friday said it expects the coronavirus to cost the world economy $280 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf we\u2019re right, then this will mean that global GDP will not grow in [quarter over quarter] terms for the first time since 2009,\u201d the economists wrote in a note. \u201cWe assume the virus will be contained soon, and that lost output is made up in subsequent quarters, so that world GDP reaches the level it would have done had there been no outbreak by the middle of 2021.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings Bonanza\n&gt; Better-than-expected earnings have helped stoke the market\u2019s recent gains. There are dozens of earnings expected in the week ahead, including CVS Health Wednesday and Pepsi, Nvidia and Kraft Heinz Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; So far, more than 70% of companies are beating forecasts and profits are growing by 2.3%, when including both companies that have reported and those expected to report, according to Refinitiv. At the start of the earnings reporting period, earnings growth was expected to decline.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts will also look to companies to continue disclosing how the virus is impacting their operations. VF Corp, for instance, said 60% of its stores in China are now closed, and those that remain open have serous declines.\n*****\n&gt; # Playing Politics\n&gt; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sent a shudder through markets when he began to rise in the polls ahead of Iowa\u2019s caucuses. But the chaos in declaring a winner in Iowa this past week, leaves the Democratic field wide open. So New Hampshire\u2019s primary Tuesday will also be important.\n*****\n&gt; The left-leaning Sanders is viewed as negative for the stock market, but his main rivals, Joseph Biden and now Pete Buttigieg, who seems to have led in Iowa, are both moderates. Sanders leads in the New Hampshire polls and is expected to win his neighboring state.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s going to continue to matter for quite some time, until we get clarity at least on who the Democratic candidate is going to be,\u201d said Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO. \u201d[Buttigieg] would be much more business friendly than some of the other candidates. Does that make him more or less electable? If he\u2019s more that could be a market negative development.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has gained 55% since Donald Trump became president, and analysts say he is viewed by investors as having the best policies for the stock market. Some Democrats, particularly Sanders, would raise taxes sharply.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qOqI74J.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/n8uJhuY.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/qSPsa54.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yKvMhID.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qFnHyJw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Zwtq6za.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Crf7CiP.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSa5dB3.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8e4snrC.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O4BbZMh.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4df33Zh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YwquWUG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/nJe64uF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Week Before Presidents\u2019 Day Bullish since 1990\n\n&gt; Page 100 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 points out Presidents\u2019 Day as the poorest performing holiday of the eight holidays that are tracked. Unlike the others, the trading day before and the trading day after this three-day holiday weekend are both down on average over the past 40 years. However, the full week before the long holiday weekend has a bullish record. Since 1990 DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 20 times with average weekly gains of 0.66% and 0.48% respectively. NASDAQ has one additional weekly decline while Russell 2000 has been the strongest, up 23 times with an average gain of 0.79%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/87d4499ef13ff59956f4c6343e3c411e/5b2bbadb398d5a54-f0/s500x750/24f2f57a33d656e400f05e96ccd367ce42aa6af8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Strong Jobs Report to Begin 2020\n\n&gt; U.S. hiring came in stronger than expected in January, rebounding from a disappointing December print.\n\n&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose by 225,000 in January, far surpassing Bloomberg\u2019s consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released today by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This number may help alleviate some investor unease over December\u2019s somewhat weak reading. We argued at the time that December\u2019s reading likely was due in large part to calendar effects and the volatility of month-to-month changes. We prefer to base our views of the labor market\u2019s vitality on the larger trend, which, has been undeniably strong, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kciking-off-2020-with-a-strong-rebound.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some investors have questioned how long hiring can remain elevated before we experience a worker shortage or a sharp rise in wages. The answer, according to this report, is not yet.\n\n&gt; In addition to the strong hiring numbers, workers also have enjoyed healthy wage gains. January saw average hourly earnings rise 3.1% year over year, a slight pickup from December, while average hours worked remained unchanged. \u201cToday\u2019s wage number exceeds inflation, meaning workers are growing their purchasing power in real terms and should be able to continue increasing their consumption of goods and services,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cBut the number is also lower than the 4% threshold that has historically signaled an overheating job market and potential for subsequent economic and market volatility. This is a very encouraging report.\u201d\n\n&gt; The one slight blip in today\u2019s release showed the unemployment rate inching 0.1% higher to 3.6%. This was mainly due to changes to the size of the labor force, which affected revisions. Still, given the extremely low unemployment level, the volatility of month-to-month numbers, and the overwhelmingly positive tone of the other data points released today, we feel confident about the prospects for the U.S. consumer to continue powering this economic expansion through 2020 and beyond.\n\n*****\n\n# New Highs Tilt Scales to Bulls\n\n&gt; China is cutting tariffs; the impeachment process has come to an end and the market is at new all-time highs. The coronavirus is still a concern, but apparently not as much as it was less than one week ago. Progress has been made. Official emergency declarations have mobilized a stronger response. China has quickly built additional hospitals and work is underway on a treatment. Gilead (GILD) appears to be the first to offer a potential cure although its drug remdesivir has not been approved to cure any disease yet. These recent developments along with solid earnings, have been the fuel to reverse the market\u2019s late January retreat in just a few trading sessions this month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb99cd5eedf67e83954c998976da3a81/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-49/s500x750/705cf31363591f72784f14fed6029effc84a4228.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/07db71096c88ddf9778d29d0bdb69e60/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-86/s500x750/e6f5479d3cea9759bc52d0c99fff7704947ff575.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdb9b967be268f1fcb154d09dfa8553b/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-2c/s500x750/4f3021be20791991f739de9273300f798a7cbf31.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In the above charts, the market\u2019s strength since October can be seen along with second half of January weakness. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have remained comfortably above their respective 200-day moving averages since October. In January only DJIA actually (and briefly) closed below its even higher 50-day moving average. The market\u2019s rebound surge in February has also reversed negative readings from Stochastic, relative strength and MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; Momentum clearly favors the bulls and January\u2019s negative finish remains unconfirmed as of today. As long as economic data and corporate earnings remain positive then the market is likely to continue the trend that has been in place since last October, higher. There are likely to be some dips along the way with the next possible soft patch arriving when earnings season nears its end later this month and/or in the first half of March.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical February Trading: Tepid Month with Solid Mid-Month Rally\n\n&gt; February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&amp;P 500 has averaged a measly 0.1%. Over the last 21-year period S&amp;P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of 0.4% in February. February\u2019s first trading day has historically been good, like today, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been rather lacking.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/10b0e0be07d6824e6a082e13a26bc1d9/e1ddcea381248255-b9/s500x750/a2b1e806df3ec07b5e77c69efd297e5802fa1208.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Does A Lower January Have Bears Smiling?\n\n&gt; Stocks got off to a nice start in 2020, until the late January selloff due to the coronavirus outbreak fears. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell only 0.2% for the month, but it did mark the end to a 4-month win streak. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2020?\n\n&gt; There\u2019s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, \u201cAs goes January, so goes the year.\u201d This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?\n\n&gt; As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&amp;P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.2% on average over the final 11 months and were higher less than 60% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/so-goes-january-so-goes-the-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another way to look at this data shows the average full year return based on if stocks are higher in January or not. As you can clearly see, stocks have tended to have trouble gaining any traction over the rest of the year after a January loss, while a green January has been quite strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-january-barometer.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; It isn\u2019t all bad news though. Remember the S&amp;P 500 was down only 0.2% in January, so one could argue that it was really flat. \u201cYes, a lower January is a potential worry for the bulls,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut it is worth noting the previous 5 times (and 7 of 8) when stocks were lower in January, those final 11 months rallied. So this might not be the clear cut bearish signal so many think it is.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/a-lower-january-hasnt-been-as-bearish-lately.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Spoiled by Coronavirus\n\n&gt; The market decline on the last day of January spoiled what would have been the fourth consecutive January Trifecta. S&amp;P 500 finished January down 0.2% and thus the January Barometer was negative.\n\n&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.7% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .743 batting average.\n\n&gt; This year\u2019s combination of a positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days with a full-month January loss has only occurred eleven times (including this year) since 1950. In the previous ten occurrences S&amp;P 500 was down six times in February with an average loss of 1.5%. However, over the remaining 11 months of the year, S&amp;P 500 advanced 80% of the time with an average gain of 7.4%. Full-year performance was positive 70% of the time, but with an average gain of 2.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6df473ecb7e9c5b9c107222c65f3131a/7be8cdb3803e5a29-77/s500x750/284bbb2175287530e6f02fc233a1772dce7a4852.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 7th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.9.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$ROKU** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$CVS** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$UAA** \n&gt; * **$QSR** \n&gt; * **$L** \n&gt; * **$AGN** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$LYFT** \n&gt; * **$TEVA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$MCY** \n&gt; * **$SAFE** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$DO** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$D** \n&gt; * **$CYBR**\n&gt; * **$MELI** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$CNA** \n&gt; * **$EXAS** \n&gt; * **$GT** \n&gt; * **$HLT** \n&gt; * **$AYX** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$APPS** \n&gt; * **$WM** \n&gt; * **$GPN** \n&gt; * **$CRNT** \n&gt; * **$BIP** \n&gt; * **$YETI** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$LSCC** \n&gt; * **$RNG** \n&gt; * **$NMM** \n&gt; * **$JE**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tvfxbnh.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DYTRi0w.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sWB49z5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hiUR1ec.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w9FUjTz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cPnIcpa.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/BBaSJcZ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tjUpFdY.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/D7eo9EG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Y4rdLiL.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/feUqB85.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TGxgQ96.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tC78cWW.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. $216.53\n&gt; **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 7:10 AM ET on Thursday, February 13, 2020. The consensus earnings estimate is $2.25 per share on revenue of $22.68 billion and the Earnings Whisper \u00ae number is $2.35 per share. Investor sentiment going into the company's earnings release has 79% expecting an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are for year-over-year earnings growth of 33.93% with revenue increasing by 32.97%. Short interest has increased by 52.7% since the company's last earnings release while the stock has drifted higher by 21.0% from its open following the earnings release to be 19.4% above its 200 day moving average of $181.36.
