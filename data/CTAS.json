For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n&gt; Those in CNBC\u2019s survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&amp;P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n&gt; Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n&gt; But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It\u2019s nothing like what you saw in the spring,\u201d said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. \u201cIt\u2019s going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n&gt; # The week ahead\n&gt; Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&amp;P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla\u2019s entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&amp;P on Monday morning.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ll see whether or not there\u2019s selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it\u2019s absorbed within the S&amp;P,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&amp;P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. \u201cAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday\u2019s Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n&gt; # First-quarter speed bump\n&gt; \u201cThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there\u2019s the potential for some negative outlooks. \u201cI think we\u2019re due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.\u201d Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Fundstrat\u2019s Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he\u2019s looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n&gt; There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it\u2019s more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n&gt; If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it\u2019s close. It\u2019s important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,\u201d said Krosby.\n*****\n&gt; But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it\u2019s pretty clear you\u2019re going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don\u2019t like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,\u201d said Bank of America\u2019s Harris.\n*****\n&gt; Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n&gt; In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it\u2019s hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,\u201d said Arone.\n*****\n&gt; Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don\u2019t have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n&gt; The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n&gt; He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n&gt; In the CNBC/Moody\u2019s Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n&gt; If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that\u2019s open, that\u2019s a big boost,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don\u2019t.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # An Overbought World\n\n&gt; The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n&gt; If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n&gt; While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n&gt; Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n&gt; The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&amp;P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n&gt; The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n&gt; With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n&gt; Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n&gt; If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, October\u2019s report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October\u2019s report.\n\n&gt; Breadth in this month\u2019s report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don\u2019t hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars &amp; Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics &amp; Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food &amp; Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online\u2013 all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n&gt; The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Chart of the Year\n\n&gt; Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. \u201cOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don\u2019t bet against several more years of new highs.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We\u2019ve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here\u2019s the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&amp;P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvRiIU8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/nc9RmtFS/er122120am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8k0XsCSr/er122120pm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tbnDYwD/er122320am.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.\n*****\n&gt; Those in CNBC\u2019s survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&amp;P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.\n*****\n&gt; Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.\n*****\n&gt; But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It\u2019s nothing like what you saw in the spring,\u201d said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. \u201cIt\u2019s going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.\n*****\n&gt; # The week ahead\n&gt; Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&amp;P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla\u2019s entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&amp;P on Monday morning.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ll see whether or not there\u2019s selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it\u2019s absorbed within the S&amp;P,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&amp;P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. \u201cAt this point, the vaccines are stimulus,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday\u2019s Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.\n*****\n&gt; # First-quarter speed bump\n&gt; \u201cThe first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there\u2019s the potential for some negative outlooks. \u201cI think we\u2019re due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.\u201d Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Fundstrat\u2019s Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he\u2019s looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.\n*****\n&gt; There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it\u2019s more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.\n*****\n&gt; If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it\u2019s close. It\u2019s important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,\u201d said Krosby.\n*****\n&gt; But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it\u2019s pretty clear you\u2019re going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don\u2019t like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,\u201d said Bank of America\u2019s Harris.\n*****\n&gt; Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.\n*****\n&gt; In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGiven the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it\u2019s hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,\u201d said Arone.\n*****\n&gt; Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don\u2019t have solid earnings streams.\n*****\n&gt; The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.\n*****\n&gt; He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.\n*****\n&gt; In the CNBC/Moody\u2019s Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.\n*****\n&gt; If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you put stimulus like that into the economy that\u2019s open, that\u2019s a big boost,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don\u2019t.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LhgmNdV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KSkp1c5.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sWMhkZ4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/brpytRb3/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D6dCoUA.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BYpbNxT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xL78HsG.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nE072Rq.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwRa0FB.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HtN5m6b.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cvJ3eBi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ed1Hvv8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/whYpZrV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # An Overbought World\n\n&gt; The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.\n\n&gt; If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**\n\n&gt; While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI-Shorter-Term.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Real Santa Claus Rally\n\n&gt; Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n&gt; The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&amp;P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**\n\n&gt; The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/95573b80c952987ce6cddf016781c869/c0018ed75496c55e-6b/s500x750/2ac5dfda390dff518e0caa07098761d86191d1e3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days\n\n&gt; With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**\n\n&gt; Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Levels.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Wretched Retail Sales\n\n&gt; If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, October\u2019s report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October\u2019s report.\n\n&gt; Breadth in this month\u2019s report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don\u2019t hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars &amp; Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics &amp; Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food &amp; Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online\u2013 all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**\n\n&gt; The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Chart of the Year\n\n&gt; Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. \u201cOne thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cGiven that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don\u2019t bet against several more years of new highs.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo!

6, 1584202453, 1, "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 16th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks are expected to see more wild swings, even if Fed makes big policy move  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/stocks-are-expected-to-see-more-wild-swings-even-if-fed-makes-big-policy-move.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Now that stocks have entered a bear market, more wild volatility is expected in the week ahead as investors await a big policy move by the Federal Reserve.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected by some economists to take its benchmark federal funds target range back to zero, as the economy looks more and more like it could fall into a recession, due to the impact of the coronavirus.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the market was sharply lower but swung wildly in both directions, including the stunning 10% decline in the Dow Thursday, the worst one-day drop since the 1987 market crash followed by Friday\u2019s 9.3% gain, the best day in more than 11 years.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended up 9.3% Friday at 2,711, its best day since Oct. 28, 2008. The S&amp;P is now 20.2% below its February high.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market purge is not over, though it could be closer to a bottom, with some expecting the S&amp;P 500 to fall through 2,400 before it finds a floor.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could say we\u2019re pricing a garden variety recession,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. \u201cWe come up with a range of 2,300 to 2,600 as recession territory.\u201d She said the average drop during a recession, since the 1930s, was 32%. The S&amp;P had been as much as 29% off its Feb. 19 high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf [S&amp;P] went below 2,300, it would be telling you the market is pricing in something worse than a recession, In the financial crisis we lost 57% and in the tech bubble, we lost 49%,\u201d said Calvasina.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 8.9% for the week, its worst loss since the week of Feb. 28.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we needed to get through this week, in particular \u2014 the one where the country went into shut down and now get the second go around of policy response. If they really do bring out the bazookas we should be darn close\u201d to the bottom, said Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research.\n*****\n&gt; But strategists also point out that the coronavirus is unpredictable and it is hard to say when it will peak, even though many economists expect a bounce back in economic growth by the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, which allows him to tap federal agencies to provide emergency funds and other responses to the crisis. The president also announced the government would buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and that 1.4 million test kits would be available in the next week.\n*****\n&gt; Markets will also be looking for further action, which the Trump administration says could include targeted financial aid to industries that are hard hit, like airlines.\n*****\n&gt; As communities around the country attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the potential hit to the economy grows. Companies have told workers to work from home, universities are shutting campuses, a handful of states closed public schools, and major sporting and other events have been canceled.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf it indeed is declared a recession, it will really only be a three-month drop in activity,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cIn 2008, the household sector had the highest debt levels it ever had, and the household sector was in no position to respond to stimulus. This is quite different.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe see where are are today is pricing in a recession. It went from a growth scare down to recession territory,\u201d said Calvasina. She said the market is not ready to move higher yet. \u201cI think something else we\u2019ve got to see in addition to extreme panic ratings from the sentiment indicators, we do need to see the news flow get better on the virus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will continue to look for more action from Washington, and in the coming week it will also be the Fed\u2019s policy response that could drive the market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the US and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook, we now expect the FOMC to cut the funds rate 100bp on March 18, a faster return to the crisis-era 0-0.25% rate than under our previous call for two 50bp steps in March and April,\u201d Goldman economists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed on Thursday announced a significant increase in funds available for its repo operations, to provide liquidity for the short term funding markets. It also said it would purchase a broad range of Treasury securities, across maturities, with the $60 billion it currently uses to buy Treasury bills on a monthly basis.\n*****\n&gt; Economists say the Fed could announce other policy moves, like purchases of mortgage securities. Some expect it to return to a \u201cpatient\u201d stance, showing a willingness to keep rates extremely low for a long time.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts have been watching the corporate bond market, where spreads blew out dramatically in the past week, particularly in high yield. Calvasina said she is not yet concerned.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve got problems in energy. We have problems in some hospitality related industries. There are pockets of stress, but for me, when I look across most S&amp;P companies\u2019 balance sheets are in really good shape,\u201d Calvasina said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a prolonged sort of downturn.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/iG7ENVB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4gwPTzC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/h9DkOZJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/4m2QVZH.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/akOOH97.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/slVwGv2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ASyHg6a.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/rbgSrGQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9nZfl7V.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eS99ijc.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tEs62Hh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/kMQTBj6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/toentZ2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ozn837y.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Signs Of A Washout?\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index\u2019s historic slide continued yesterday, culminating in nearly a 10% loss for the day, and leaving the benchmark index officially in bear market territory, just 16 trading days after setting a record high on February 19. In addition, the S&amp;P 500 has now moved more than 4% each day this week, leaving investors and professionals alike wondering when this volatility could end. While nobody knows for sure, one thing we always look for at market bottoms are signs of extremes, both from a sentiment and price perspective.\n\n&gt; From an anecdotal sentiment perspective, certainly fears of COVID-19 have reached the masses, with travel plans canceled and announcements of major events called off coming nearly every hour. However, investor survey data shows a similar story with the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey showing the highest percentage of bears since April 2013. In addition, the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index, which represents the average exposure to US equity markets by the surveyed investment managers, reached its lowest level since September 2015. Following each of those instances, the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 13% over the next year.\n\n&gt; Another way of gauging sentiment can be from the internals of the market. While the S&amp;P 500 is now well below its 200-day moving average, that doesn\u2019t mean each stock in the index has moved below its respective 200-day moving average. In fact, regardless of the broad market\u2019s trend, when less than 20% of the individual components of the index are trading below their 200-day moving averages, it is considered an extreme. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Thursday\u2019s sell-off left less 6% of the S&amp;P 500 there, a number last seen in March 2009. \u201cThese are truly frightening times,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, it is important to remember that the signs of panic we are seeing are typically found at or near major market lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Signs_of_Washout.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Fastest Bear Market Ever\n\n&gt; The historic volatility continues, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average officially setting its fastest move from a new all-time high to a bear market (down 20% from the highs) in the 124-year history of the index. It took only 19 days for this to take place, which is far and away the new record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-1-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Not to be outdone, the S&amp;P 500 Index is set to close down 20% from all-time highs today, doing this in only 16 days. Again, as of the time we are writing this blog, the S&amp;P 500 is in bear market territory, but there always could be a chance for a late-day rally.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFrom major sports postponing their seasons, to travel bans to Europe, the economic impact of the coronavirus is growing exponentially with each passing day,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMarkets are pricing in a potential recession and inevitable second quarter slowdown, but it is all about expectations. Should the virus be contained and the worst-case scenarios not materialize, now could be a nice opportunity for longer-term investors.\u201d\n\n&gt; Last, one of Warren Buffett\u2019s most famous quotes is, \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy and be fearful when others are fearful.\u201d We\u2019ve seen many signs of extreme fear the past few days, but the CNN Fear &amp; Greed Index hitting 1 earlier today is quite a historic level of fear. This proprietary indicator looks at multiple inputs (like put/call ratios, momentum, and volatility), but on a scale of 1-100, this morning\u2019s 1 is the lowest level ever seen, besting the 2 it hit at the lows in December 2018. From a contrarian point of view, this could be quite meaningful.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Perspectives on Waterfall Declines\n\n&gt; Volatile market action over the several weeks warrants some much needed perspective into the history of these types of waterfall declines. Fortunately, we have this research on hand and have been examining the nature of deep, fast selloffs like we have experience here in early 2020 as well as the nature of the inevitable and often sharp recoveries.\n\n&gt; First of all yes, this time is different \u2013 and yet it\u2019s not. The headline causes of each of these historic waterfall declines are all different and yet investor, trader and money manager behavior remains rather similar. Fear has once again exposed the market\u2019s overvaluation and weaknesses. This time it\u2019s the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and price war in the oil market that spills over into the rest of the financial.\n\n&gt; Like the previous occurrences of waterfall declines in the table and graphs below the market reacted to fear and sold off fast and hard. It\u2019s too early to tell if this waterfall decline is over or how fast and far the recovery will be. As we continue to analyze the current situation a thorough review of the history of waterfall declines and their subsequent recoveries should provide some much needed perspective.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/31cca506c45d87ad962ce9c707baf21a/fc7021573b50880b-76/s500x750/0a6588971f599cbbca194b38b62a47c087875238.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Friday 13th, DJIA Attempting to Recover &amp; End Losing Friday Streak\n\n&gt; Friday is a significant day of the week because it is the last day of trading and positions held over the weekend could be at higher risk of an exogenous event or an unanticipated headline. Pages 143 &amp; 144 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 show the difference in Friday performance during bull and bear markets. Friday\u2019s have been weaker in bear markets.\n\n&gt; However today, on a Friday the 13th of all days, DJIA is fighting to recover some of its losses this week and to end its streak of down Fridays at seven. Down Friday DJIA losing streaks of seven or more, like the current streak, are actually somewhat rare in history. Prior to this year, DJIA has had just six similar or longer down Friday streaks going back to 1950. The last streak of down Fridays was in March and April of 2017. The longest streak lasted nine Fridays beginning on the last Friday of 2000 and lasting into February 2001.\n\n &gt; In the above chart the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after the last six DJIA down Friday losing streaks of seven or more have been plotted to display the average performance before and after the last down Friday of the streak. (There are on average 21 trading days in a typical calendar month) Weakness and lower was the trend during the down Friday streak, but once the streak came to an end, DJIA was higher 60 trading days later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c8d6237984423d89dc5b20f4a1bf7009/07327bf517318c16-1e/s500x750/13020ac23c0adf1831e35c982c37f1602a236fd1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Last Stocks Above Their Moving Averages\n\n&gt; The massive declines over the past few weeks have left conditions extremely oversold. As we highlighted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, breadth has been awful while there is no longer a single stock in the S&amp;P 500 that is overbought (1 or more standard deviations above its 50-DMA). In fact, after yesterday's absolute washout, there is only a small handful of stocks that are above their 50 and 200-DMAs. In regards to the 50-DMA, less than 1% of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above this average which is the first time that has happened since 2011. The only time in between that saw a similarly weak reading, although not quite hitting that under 1% requirement was back in December of 2018 when 1.19% of stocks were above their 50-DMA. As for the 200-DMA, only 5.59% are above that level. That is the lowest reading since March of 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MAs.png))**\n\n&gt; The average stock is now 26.56% below its 50-day and 24.5% below its 200-day. The table below shows those 22 remaining stocks that are still above their 200-DMAs as of yesterday's close and the few that are also below their 50-DMA. Of these, only Regeneron (REGN), Kroger (KR), Digital Realty Trust (DLR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are also above their 50-DMAs. The only other stock in the index that is also above its 50-DMA is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is 11% below its 200-DMA. While these stocks have all held above their long term moving average recently, only GILD and REGN have risen since the index's high on 2/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Above-200-table2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Selloff Erases All of US Market Cap Gains Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; With the US stock market down nearly 7% yet again today, the total market cap of US companies as measured by the Russell 3,000 has fallen $11.5 trillion in less than a month. On February 19th, total US market cap was just over $35 trillion. It's at $23.8 trillion as of this morning.\n\n&gt; What makes this drop even more noteworthy is that $23.8 trillion was the market cap of US companies on Election Day 2016. At this point in time, all of the market cap gains seen since President Trump's election victory have been wiped out.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/raymktcap.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Low Rates Send Mortgage Applications Surging\n\n&gt; Coronavirus fears have broadly sent rates lower over the past month. Currently, the national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stands at 3.68%; just off the low of 3.55% from earlier in the month. With mortgage rates now basically at their lowest levels since late 2016, homeowners have been quickly enticed to jump on these lower rates.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MRNA.png))**\n\n&gt; Last week, weekly mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a roughly 15% surge as rates were reaching record lows. In the time since then, the Fed's 50 bps cut came into effect and yields fell even further which led mortgage applications this week to surge 55.4%. That is the highest week over week increase in mortgage applications since November of 2008 when they had risen 112.1%. Outside of that period, we've only seen larger weekly increases a few other times since 1990.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The spike was driven largely by refinancing applications which rose 78.6% week-over-week. As with the composite, that was the biggest weekly jump in refi applications since the housing bubble. Prior to that, once again you would need to go back to 2001 or the 1990s to find larger weekly increases in mortgage refinance applications.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-ref.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NIO** \n&gt; * **$HQY** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$MOMO** \n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$CRWD** \n&gt; * **$HUYA** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$BE** \n&gt; * **$MDB** \n&gt; * **$BZUN** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$YY** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$MUX** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$TME** \n&gt; * **$MIK** \n&gt; * **$CVSI** \n&gt; * **$ACRX** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$WPRT** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$GIS**\n&gt; * **$CPRX** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$TLRD** \n&gt; * **$ZTO** \n&gt; * **$BAX** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$DLTH** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$CTAS** \n&gt; * **$SMAR** \n&gt; * **$WSM** \n&gt; * **$TCOM** \n&gt; * **$HIBB** \n&gt; * **$REI** \n&gt; * **$DBI** \n&gt; * **$CTRA** \n&gt; * **$GPL** \n&gt; * **$CMC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/9nZfl7V.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EKAkJgU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR  THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/631cGTg.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FLCjERW.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GCK6dns.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J7uVG2b.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ADUyE5E.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/q2AM8aO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sXXUKYj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZISY7gz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pgdAKJu.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.20.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# NIO Inc. $3.11\n&gt; **NIO Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 16th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks are expected to see more wild swings, even if Fed makes big policy move  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/stocks-are-expected-to-see-more-wild-swings-even-if-fed-makes-big-policy-move.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Now that stocks have entered a bear market, more wild volatility is expected in the week ahead as investors await a big policy move by the Federal Reserve.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected by some economists to take its benchmark federal funds target range back to zero, as the economy looks more and more like it could fall into a recession, due to the impact of the coronavirus.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the market was sharply lower but swung wildly in both directions, including the stunning 10% decline in the Dow Thursday, the worst one-day drop since the 1987 market crash followed by Friday\u2019s 9.3% gain, the best day in more than 11 years.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended up 9.3% Friday at 2,711, its best day since Oct. 28, 2008. The S&amp;P is now 20.2% below its February high.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market purge is not over, though it could be closer to a bottom, with some expecting the S&amp;P 500 to fall through 2,400 before it finds a floor.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could say we\u2019re pricing a garden variety recession,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. \u201cWe come up with a range of 2,300 to 2,600 as recession territory.\u201d She said the average drop during a recession, since the 1930s, was 32%. The S&amp;P had been as much as 29% off its Feb. 19 high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf [S&amp;P] went below 2,300, it would be telling you the market is pricing in something worse than a recession, In the financial crisis we lost 57% and in the tech bubble, we lost 49%,\u201d said Calvasina.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 8.9% for the week, its worst loss since the week of Feb. 28.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we needed to get through this week, in particular \u2014 the one where the country went into shut down and now get the second go around of policy response. If they really do bring out the bazookas we should be darn close\u201d to the bottom, said Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research.\n*****\n&gt; But strategists also point out that the coronavirus is unpredictable and it is hard to say when it will peak, even though many economists expect a bounce back in economic growth by the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, which allows him to tap federal agencies to provide emergency funds and other responses to the crisis. The president also announced the government would buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and that 1.4 million test kits would be available in the next week.\n*****\n&gt; Markets will also be looking for further action, which the Trump administration says could include targeted financial aid to industries that are hard hit, like airlines.\n*****\n&gt; As communities around the country attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the potential hit to the economy grows. Companies have told workers to work from home, universities are shutting campuses, a handful of states closed public schools, and major sporting and other events have been canceled.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf it indeed is declared a recession, it will really only be a three-month drop in activity,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cIn 2008, the household sector had the highest debt levels it ever had, and the household sector was in no position to respond to stimulus. This is quite different.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe see where are are today is pricing in a recession. It went from a growth scare down to recession territory,\u201d said Calvasina. She said the market is not ready to move higher yet. \u201cI think something else we\u2019ve got to see in addition to extreme panic ratings from the sentiment indicators, we do need to see the news flow get better on the virus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will continue to look for more action from Washington, and in the coming week it will also be the Fed\u2019s policy response that could drive the market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the US and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook, we now expect the FOMC to cut the funds rate 100bp on March 18, a faster return to the crisis-era 0-0.25% rate than under our previous call for two 50bp steps in March and April,\u201d Goldman economists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed on Thursday announced a significant increase in funds available for its repo operations, to provide liquidity for the short term funding markets. It also said it would purchase a broad range of Treasury securities, across maturities, with the $60 billion it currently uses to buy Treasury bills on a monthly basis.\n*****\n&gt; Economists say the Fed could announce other policy moves, like purchases of mortgage securities. Some expect it to return to a \u201cpatient\u201d stance, showing a willingness to keep rates extremely low for a long time.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts have been watching the corporate bond market, where spreads blew out dramatically in the past week, particularly in high yield. Calvasina said she is not yet concerned.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve got problems in energy. We have problems in some hospitality related industries. There are pockets of stress, but for me, when I look across most S&amp;P companies\u2019 balance sheets are in really good shape,\u201d Calvasina said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a prolonged sort of downturn.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/iG7ENVB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4gwPTzC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/h9DkOZJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/4m2QVZH.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/akOOH97.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/slVwGv2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ASyHg6a.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/rbgSrGQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9nZfl7V.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eS99ijc.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tEs62Hh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/kMQTBj6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/toentZ2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ozn837y.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Signs Of A Washout?\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index\u2019s historic slide continued yesterday, culminating in nearly a 10% loss for the day, and leaving the benchmark index officially in bear market territory, just 16 trading days after setting a record high on February 19. In addition, the S&amp;P 500 has now moved more than 4% each day this week, leaving investors and professionals alike wondering when this volatility could end. While nobody knows for sure, one thing we always look for at market bottoms are signs of extremes, both from a sentiment and price perspective.\n\n&gt; From an anecdotal sentiment perspective, certainly fears of COVID-19 have reached the masses, with travel plans canceled and announcements of major events called off coming nearly every hour. However, investor survey data shows a similar story with the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey showing the highest percentage of bears since April 2013. In addition, the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index, which represents the average exposure to US equity markets by the surveyed investment managers, reached its lowest level since September 2015. Following each of those instances, the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 13% over the next year.\n\n&gt; Another way of gauging sentiment can be from the internals of the market. While the S&amp;P 500 is now well below its 200-day moving average, that doesn\u2019t mean each stock in the index has moved below its respective 200-day moving average. In fact, regardless of the broad market\u2019s trend, when less than 20% of the individual components of the index are trading below their 200-day moving averages, it is considered an extreme. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Thursday\u2019s sell-off left less 6% of the S&amp;P 500 there, a number last seen in March 2009. \u201cThese are truly frightening times,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, it is important to remember that the signs of panic we are seeing are typically found at or near major market lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Signs_of_Washout.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Fastest Bear Market Ever\n\n&gt; The historic volatility continues, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average officially setting its fastest move from a new all-time high to a bear market (down 20% from the highs) in the 124-year history of the index. It took only 19 days for this to take place, which is far and away the new record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-1-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Not to be outdone, the S&amp;P 500 Index is set to close down 20% from all-time highs today, doing this in only 16 days. Again, as of the time we are writing this blog, the S&amp;P 500 is in bear market territory, but there always could be a chance for a late-day rally.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFrom major sports postponing their seasons, to travel bans to Europe, the economic impact of the coronavirus is growing exponentially with each passing day,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMarkets are pricing in a potential recession and inevitable second quarter slowdown, but it is all about expectations. Should the virus be contained and the worst-case scenarios not materialize, now could be a nice opportunity for longer-term investors.\u201d\n\n&gt; Last, one of Warren Buffett\u2019s most famous quotes is, \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy and be fearful when others are fearful.\u201d We\u2019ve seen many signs of extreme fear the past few days, but the CNN Fear &amp; Greed Index hitting 1 earlier today is quite a historic level of fear. This proprietary indicator looks at multiple inputs (like put/call ratios, momentum, and volatility), but on a scale of 1-100, this morning\u2019s 1 is the lowest level ever seen, besting the 2 it hit at the lows in December 2018. From a contrarian point of view, this could be quite meaningful.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Perspectives on Waterfall Declines\n\n&gt; Volatile market action over the several weeks warrants some much needed perspective into the history of these types of waterfall declines. Fortunately, we have this research on hand and have been examining the nature of deep, fast selloffs like we have experience here in early 2020 as well as the nature of the inevitable and often sharp recoveries.\n\n&gt; First of all yes, this time is different \u2013 and yet it\u2019s not. The headline causes of each of these historic waterfall declines are all different and yet investor, trader and money manager behavior remains rather similar. Fear has once again exposed the market\u2019s overvaluation and weaknesses. This time it\u2019s the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and price war in the oil market that spills over into the rest of the financial.\n\n&gt; Like the previous occurrences of waterfall declines in the table and graphs below the market reacted to fear and sold off fast and hard. It\u2019s too early to tell if this waterfall decline is over or how fast and far the recovery will be. As we continue to analyze the current situation a thorough review of the history of waterfall declines and their subsequent recoveries should provide some much needed perspective.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/31cca506c45d87ad962ce9c707baf21a/fc7021573b50880b-76/s500x750/0a6588971f599cbbca194b38b62a47c087875238.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Friday 13th, DJIA Attempting to Recover &amp; End Losing Friday Streak\n\n&gt; Friday is a significant day of the week because it is the last day of trading and positions held over the weekend could be at higher risk of an exogenous event or an unanticipated headline. Pages 143 &amp; 144 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 show the difference in Friday performance during bull and bear markets. Friday\u2019s have been weaker in bear markets.\n\n&gt; However today, on a Friday the 13th of all days, DJIA is fighting to recover some of its losses this week and to end its streak of down Fridays at seven. Down Friday DJIA losing streaks of seven or more, like the current streak, are actually somewhat rare in history. Prior to this year, DJIA has had just six similar or longer down Friday streaks going back to 1950. The last streak of down Fridays was in March and April of 2017. The longest streak lasted nine Fridays beginning on the last Friday of 2000 and lasting into February 2001.\n\n &gt; In the above chart the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after the last six DJIA down Friday losing streaks of seven or more have been plotted to display the average performance before and after the last down Friday of the streak. (There are on average 21 trading days in a typical calendar month) Weakness and lower was the trend during the down Friday streak, but once the streak came to an end, DJIA was higher 60 trading days later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c8d6237984423d89dc5b20f4a1bf7009/07327bf517318c16-1e/s500x750/13020ac23c0adf1831e35c982c37f1602a236fd1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Last Stocks Above Their Moving Averages\n\n&gt; The massive declines over the past few weeks have left conditions extremely oversold. As we highlighted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, breadth has been awful while there is no longer a single stock in the S&amp;P 500 that is overbought (1 or more standard deviations above its 50-DMA). In fact, after yesterday's absolute washout, there is only a small handful of stocks that are above their 50 and 200-DMAs. In regards to the 50-DMA, less than 1% of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above this average which is the first time that has happened since 2011. The only time in between that saw a similarly weak reading, although not quite hitting that under 1% requirement was back in December of 2018 when 1.19% of stocks were above their 50-DMA. As for the 200-DMA, only 5.59% are above that level. That is the lowest reading since March of 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MAs.png))**\n\n&gt; The average stock is now 26.56% below its 50-day and 24.5% below its 200-day. The table below shows those 22 remaining stocks that are still above their 200-DMAs as of yesterday's close and the few that are also below their 50-DMA. Of these, only Regeneron (REGN), Kroger (KR), Digital Realty Trust (DLR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are also above their 50-DMAs. The only other stock in the index that is also above its 50-DMA is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is 11% below its 200-DMA. While these stocks have all held above their long term moving average recently, only GILD and REGN have risen since the index's high on 2/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Above-200-table2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Selloff Erases All of US Market Cap Gains Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; With the US stock market down nearly 7% yet again today, the total market cap of US companies as measured by the Russell 3,000 has fallen $11.5 trillion in less than a month. On February 19th, total US market cap was just over $35 trillion. It's at $23.8 trillion as of this morning.\n\n&gt; What makes this drop even more noteworthy is that $23.8 trillion was the market cap of US companies on Election Day 2016. At this point in time, all of the market cap gains seen since President Trump's election victory have been wiped out.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/raymktcap.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Low Rates Send Mortgage Applications Surging\n\n&gt; Coronavirus fears have broadly sent rates lower over the past month. Currently, the national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stands at 3.68%; just off the low of 3.55% from earlier in the month. With mortgage rates now basically at their lowest levels since late 2016, homeowners have been quickly enticed to jump on these lower rates.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MRNA.png))**\n\n&gt; Last week, weekly mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a roughly 15% surge as rates were reaching record lows. In the time since then, the Fed's 50 bps cut came into effect and yields fell even further which led mortgage applications this week to surge 55.4%. That is the highest week over week increase in mortgage applications since November of 2008 when they had risen 112.1%. Outside of that period, we've only seen larger weekly increases a few other times since 1990.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The spike was driven largely by refinancing applications which rose 78.6% week-over-week. As with the composite, that was the biggest weekly jump in refi applications since the housing bubble. Prior to that, once again you would need to go back to 2001 or the 1990s to find larger weekly increases in mortgage refinance applications.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-ref.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NIO** \n&gt; * **$HQY** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$MOMO** \n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$CRWD** \n&gt; * **$HUYA** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$BE** \n&gt; * **$MDB** \n&gt; * **$BZUN** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$YY** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$MUX** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$TME** \n&gt; * **$MIK** \n&gt; * **$CVSI** \n&gt; * **$ACRX** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$WPRT** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$GIS**\n&gt; * **$CPRX** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$TLRD** \n&gt; * **$ZTO** \n&gt; * **$BAX** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$DLTH** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$CTAS** \n&gt; * **$SMAR** \n&gt; * **$WSM** \n&gt; * **$TCOM** \n&gt; * **$HIBB** \n&gt; * **$REI** \n&gt; * **$DBI** \n&gt; * **$CTRA** \n&gt; * **$GPL** \n&gt; * **$CMC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/9nZfl7V.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EKAkJgU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR  THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/631cGTg.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FLCjERW.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GCK6dns.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J7uVG2b.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ADUyE5E.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/q2AM8aO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sXXUKYj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZISY7gz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pgdAKJu.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.20.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# NIO Inc. $3.11\n&gt; **NIO Inc.
