However, the stocks I invested in were stocks that I knew so I knew they weren't going anywhere. (My holdings are sne, aapl, and atvi). However, the only reason I invested in them once again was that I know them/use their products. But there's no way for me to use every company I invest in product or service so how do I know if they're a good investment or not. Like what exactly do you look for. I know the basics like to look at their balance sheet and make sure they're growing steadily. But what is the process of picking stocks? I try to google information about it but everyone has their own reasonings and it's hard to find who to trust and who not to.\n\nI don't mind doing my own research but would love like a checklist of things to look for before claiming a bad or good investment.",

    "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 30, 2020**\n\nThe stock market fell sharply today, erasing yesterday\u2019s gains to close out one of the worst weeks and worst month since March. Volatility has dominated markets in the last few weeks, with investors spooked by the uncertainty of the US presidential elections, a record number of coronavirus infections in the US and Europe, and a new wave of lockdowns across Europe.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) performed the worst, ended the day 2.54% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) ended the day 1% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) 0.52% down.\n\nYesterday after-hours, heavily-weighted tech companies, like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) reported their quarterly earnings. Though most reported third-quarter results that exceeded expectations, shares of these companies (except Alphabet) pulled back steeply today. After the strong performance of these stocks compared to the broader market this year, market participants had set their expectations exceptionally high. In other words, traders expected these companies to beat expectations by a much greater margin than they did. The earnings results for all these companies can be found in yesterday\u2019s issue of the daily recap. \n\nToday, the Federal Reserve announced it lowered the minimum loan size for its Main Street lending program to $100,000 from $250,000 and that \u201cfees have been adjusted to encourage the provision of these smaller loans\u201d. Demand for the lending program has been weak thus far, with the Fed having offered just 400 loans totaling $3.7 billion, out of the total $600 billion capacity.

The trend this week is worrying, given that only last Friday, the US set its previous record for daily new infections. According to the Washington Post, The total number of infections reported nationwide since February is virtually guaranteed to reach 9 million on Friday, just 15 days after the tally hit 8 million. At least 228,000 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in the country.\n\nEurope is in the thralls of a second surge in coronavirus, with the continent now accounting for 46% of global cases and nearly a third of total deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO) Spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris, compared to last week, daily cases in Europe have risen by \u201cabout a third\u201d and daily deaths by \u201cclose to 40%\u201d this week. This month, both France and Spain have declared states of emergency, imposing more restrictions to try to ease up pressure on hospital ICU departments. In France, the worst-hit country, more than half of ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.\n\nToday is the last Friday before the US presidential election on Tuesday. Regardless of political leanings, the results of this election are sure to have a massive effect on the stock market, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how markets react to whatever the US decides.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an announcement Friday that it will allow U.S. cruise ships to begin a phased approach to resume sailing in U.S. waters starting this Sunday. \u201cAfter expiration of CDC\u2019s No Sail Order (NSO) on October 31, 2020, CDC will take a phased approach to resume cruise ship passenger operations in U.S. waters,\u201d according to the CDC\u2019s newly published \u201cFramework for Conditional Sailing Order for Cruise Ships.\u201d Cruise stocks spiked immediately following the announcement.\n* Electric automaker Fisker completed its merger and debuted at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. \n* Alphabet's Google must tell a district court how it will respond to a federal antitrust lawsuit by mid-November, with the two sides making initial disclosures later in the month, U.S. Judge Amit Mehta said in a brief order on Friday.\n* Netflix (NFLX) on Thursday announced a price increase for U.S. subscribers.

      "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 30, 2020**\n\nThe stock market fell sharply today, erasing yesterday\u2019s gains to close out one of the worst weeks and worst month since March. Volatility has dominated markets in the last few weeks, with investors spooked by the uncertainty of the US presidential elections, a record number of coronavirus infections in the US and Europe, and a new wave of lockdowns across Europe.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) performed the worst, ended the day 2.54% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) ended the day 1% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) 0.52% down.\n\nYesterday after-hours, heavily-weighted tech companies, like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) reported their quarterly earnings. Though most reported third-quarter results that exceeded expectations, shares of these companies (except Alphabet) pulled back steeply today. After the strong performance of these stocks compared to the broader market this year, market participants had set their expectations exceptionally high. In other words, traders expected these companies to beat expectations by a much greater margin than they did. The earnings results for all these companies can be found in yesterday\u2019s issue of the daily recap. \n\nToday, the Federal Reserve announced it lowered the minimum loan size for its Main Street lending program to $100,000 from $250,000 and that \u201cfees have been adjusted to encourage the provision of these smaller loans\u201d. Demand for the lending program has been weak thus far, with the Fed having offered just 400 loans totaling $3.7 billion, out of the total $600 billion capacity. As many pundits have pointed out, many small- and mid-sized businesses have stayed on the sidelines from taking on more loans that they would eventually need to pay back during the pandemic.\n\nUnfortunately, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, there were 88,521 new coronavirus infections reported in the US yesterday, another record, and 9,540 more cases than were reported Wednesday. The trend this week is worrying, given that only last Friday, the US set its previous record for daily new infections. According to the Washington Post, The total number of infections reported nationwide since February is virtually guaranteed to reach 9 million on Friday, just 15 days after the tally hit 8 million. At least 228,000 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in the country.\n\nEurope is in the thralls of a second surge in coronavirus, with the continent now accounting for 46% of global cases and nearly a third of total deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO) Spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris, compared to last week, daily cases in Europe have risen by \u201cabout a third\u201d and daily deaths by \u201cclose to 40%\u201d this week. This month, both France and Spain have declared states of emergency, imposing more restrictions to try to ease up pressure on hospital ICU departments. In France, the worst-hit country, more than half of ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.\n\nToday is the last Friday before the US presidential election on Tuesday. Regardless of political leanings, the results of this election are sure to have a massive effect on the stock market, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how markets react to whatever the US decides.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an announcement Friday that it will allow U.S. cruise ships to begin a phased approach to resume sailing in U.S. waters starting this Sunday. \u201cAfter expiration of CDC\u2019s No Sail Order (NSO) on October 31, 2020, CDC will take a phased approach to resume cruise ship passenger operations in U.S. waters,\u201d according to the CDC\u2019s newly published \u201cFramework for Conditional Sailing Order for Cruise Ships.\u201d Cruise stocks spiked immediately following the announcement.\n* Electric automaker Fisker completed its merger and debuted at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. \n* Alphabet's Google must tell a district court how it will respond to a federal antitrust lawsuit by mid-November, with the two sides making initial disclosures later in the month, U.S. Judge Amit Mehta said in a brief order on Friday.\n* Netflix (NFLX) on Thursday announced a price increase for U.S. subscribers.

    "**US equities lower: Dow (1.43%), S&amp;P 500 (1.70%), Nasdaq (2.59%), Russell 2000 (1.75%)**\n\n* US equities lower in Friday midday trading. Comes after US equities rebounded on Thursday from a big Wednesday selloff. However, S&amp;P on pace for worst week since early September, Nasdaq since March. Weakness largely chalked up to renewed coronavirus concerns, election uncertainty and lack of fiscal stimulus. All sectors lower with tech (AAPL-US ), consumer discretionary (AMZN-US ) trailing. Healthcare, financials, comm services (GOOGL-US ) faring somewhat better. Treasuries little changed to a bit weaker in belly of the curve. Dollar little changed on the major crosses. Gold up 0.6%. WTI crude down 1.8%, on pace for \\~11% weekly decline, worst since late April.\n* **Big tech results have received a lot of the blame for the pullback** even though the group reported beat on revenue and EPS and there did not seem to be any meaningful shift in the very upbeat fundamental and secular growth narratives. In terms of some of the sticking points, **AAPL-US** missed on iPhone sales and the later iPhone 12 launch weighed on China, **AMZN-US** guided Q4 operating income below on another $4B of coronavirus investments and **FB-US** highlighted looming risks surrounding engagement, platform changes and regulatory. **GOOGL-US** has bucked the trend with the focus on an ad spending recovery, expense control and upcoming cloud disclosures.\n* Busy earnings outside of big tech. **SBUX-US** beat and saw sequential comp improvement. **SYK-US** saw continued recovery in elective procedures but no guidance. **ATVI-US** beat but Q4 EPS guidance missed. **TEAM-US** revenue growth decelerated. **TWTR-US** beat on ad strength but mDAUs missed and it guided for higher costs. **CVNA-US** missed slightly on retail units. **HIG-US** beat on better margins. **FIVN-US** beat and raised on enterprise momentum. **DECK-US** had a big beat on strength in UGG and HOKA. **COLM-US** missed and guided below. **DVN-US** raised production guidance. **CAKE-US** beat and said comps have improved in Q4.\n* Nothing particularly incremental surrounding some of the higher-profile themes outside of earnings. **Worsening coronavirus trends** in Europe and US continue to grab a lot of headlines and have raised concerns about recovery headwinds. **Election uncertainty** another overhang as Biden's lead in the polls offset by the potential for Trump to deliver another 2016 surprise. **Fiscal stimulus** on the backburner other than the seeming breakdown in the Pelosi-Mnuchin relationship. **Central bank policy support** another area of focus following the ECB though there also continue to be worries about both depleted arsenals and fatigue.\n\n**Notable Gainers:**\n\n* \\+6.2% **RMD-US** (ResMed): FQ1 earnings and revenue beat; noted sequential improvement in core apnea patient volume; analysts positive on better-than-expected sleep improvement amid declining Covid ventilator tailwinds; upgraded at JP Morgan.\n* \\+4.4% **ZEN-US** (Zendesk): Q3 EPS, revenue beat; billings, deferred revenue, cash from operations all better; guided Q4 revenue, operating income ahead of estimates; upgraded to buy from hold at Stifel, citing multi-year wave of digital upgrades in marketing, support.\n* \\+4.2% **GOOGL-US** (Alphabet): Big Q3 beat driven by increase in advertiser spend in Search and YouTube, along with continued strength in Google Cloud and Play; takeaways noted YouTube ad growth back near pre-pandemic levels (DR strong and brand spending rebounded); expense control another bright spot; Street also positive on company's plan to provide more disclosure on Google Cloud revenue and profitability.\n* \\+3% **FLEX-US** (Flex): Fiscal Q2 results ahead with company highlighting a coronavirus tailwind for health solutions, a rebound in auto, industrial growth from power solutions and renewables, and better networking and cloud growth (helped offset enterprise IT weakness); guidance ahead of expectations; Street also positive on update on NEXTracker solar business ($1B+ revenues and double digit operating margins).\n* \\+2.5% **CL-US** (Colgate-Palmolive): Q3 EPS, revenue beat; organic growth ahead on big Latin America, Europe upside; guided net and organic sales up MSD against consensus for 2.1% growth; also guided GM ahead; analysts noted GM expansion a record which allowed strong brand investments.\n* \\+2.4% **FIVN-US** (Five9): Q3 EPS, EBITDA, revenue beat on billings upside; announced acquisition of Inference Solutions, terms not disclosed; guided Q4 revenue midpoint ahead, EPS slightly better; upgraded to overweight from equal-weight at Stephens, citing improve revenue growth visibility, faster mid-market/enterprise adoption.\n* \\+1.6% **UAA-US** (Under Armour): Q3 revenue, operating income, EPS all ahead; guided FY20 EPS, revenue ahead of Street; management also highlighted margin growth vs 2019 on channel mix benefits, supply chain efficiencies; analysts positive on MyFitnessPal spinoff as sign of focus on core business, management focus on brand elevations and profitability.\n\n**Notable Decliners:**\n\n* \\-19.5% **TWTR-US** (Twitter): Q3 earnings and revenue beat on stronger advertising though monetizable daily active users sharply missed heightened expectations; noted favorable trends continued through October; analysts highlighted delay of MAP offering into 2021 due to new privacy standards, increased cost commentary for Q4 and pull forward of users during Q1/Q2.\n* \\-17% **COLM-US** (Columbia Sportswear): Q3 earnings and revenue missed with guidance below expectations; noted store traffic well below prior years, supply chain constraints related to Covid, cost containment actions; analysts highlighted weak implied gross margins in Q4 due to expected promotions though larger inventories than peers a potential benefit going into holiday season.\n* \\-9.3% **TEAM-US** (Atlassian): FQ1 earnings and revenue beat; new-customer growth and billings among the bright spots; next-Q guidance a bit weaker than the Street; analysts noted report generally positive but concerns about decelerating growth and lumpiness amid cloud transition.\n* \\-7.5% **MGM-US** (MGM Resorts): Q3 EPS and revenue missed; analysts characterized Las Vegas results as soft though Macau better; noted LV strip recovery remains highly uncertain due to reliance on air travel and group/convention business.\n* \\-6.1% **FB-US** (Facebook): Q3 beat big on key metrics with recovery in demand for digital ads the widely discussed tailwind on SMB, eComm, Retail, CPG strength; however, US and Canada users down and company warned they could fall more in Q4; also highlighted risks surrounding privacy changes, regulatory environment; guidance for a big investment ramp another overhang.\n* \\-5.3% **AAPL-US** (Apple): Sep Q revenue and EPS ahead but upside limited, iPhone revenue missed, China soft and company did not provide revenue guidance; however, other products beat (WFH tailwind) and company was positive on early iPhone 12 read-throughs; Street noted lack of guidance more of a supply issue, still expects a very powerful upgrade cycle and continued to talk up the favorable ecosystem narrative.\n* \\-4.2% **AMZN-US** (Amazon.com): Q3 revenue and operating profit well above consensus; however, Q4 operating income guide below with $4B of coronavirus costs vs $2B+ in Q3; also some focus on fulfillment productivity challenges; however, takeaways still positive, highlighting accelerated structural shift to eCommerce, strong Q4 sales guidance, stable AWS, advertising and subscription growth acceleration.\n\n10:01:07 AM CDT on 30 Oct '20",

      "selftext": "**US equities lower: Dow (1.43%), S&amp;P 500 (1.70%), Nasdaq (2.59%), Russell 2000 (1.75%)**\n\n* US equities lower in Friday midday trading. Comes after US equities rebounded on Thursday from a big Wednesday selloff. However, S&amp;P on pace for worst week since early September, Nasdaq since March. Weakness largely chalked up to renewed coronavirus concerns, election uncertainty and lack of fiscal stimulus. All sectors lower with tech (AAPL-US ), consumer discretionary (AMZN-US ) trailing. Healthcare, financials, comm services (GOOGL-US ) faring somewhat better. Treasuries little changed to a bit weaker in belly of the curve. Dollar little changed on the major crosses. Gold up 0.6%. WTI crude down 1.8%, on pace for \\~11% weekly decline, worst since late April.\n* **Big tech results have received a lot of the blame for the pullback** even though the group reported beat on revenue and EPS and there did not seem to be any meaningful shift in the very upbeat fundamental and secular growth narratives. In terms of some of the sticking points, **AAPL-US** missed on iPhone sales and the later iPhone 12 launch weighed on China, **AMZN-US** guided Q4 operating income below on another $4B of coronavirus investments and **FB-US** highlighted looming risks surrounding engagement, platform changes and regulatory. **GOOGL-US** has bucked the trend with the focus on an ad spending recovery, expense control and upcoming cloud disclosures.\n* Busy earnings outside of big tech. **SBUX-US** beat and saw sequential comp improvement. **SYK-US** saw continued recovery in elective procedures but no guidance. **ATVI-US** beat but Q4 EPS guidance missed. **TEAM-US** revenue growth decelerated. **TWTR-US** beat on ad strength but mDAUs missed and it guided for higher costs. **CVNA-US** missed slightly on retail units. **HIG-US** beat on better margins. **FIVN-US** beat and raised on enterprise momentum. **DECK-US** had a big beat on strength in UGG and HOKA. **COLM-US** missed and guided below. **DVN-US** raised production guidance. **CAKE-US** beat and said comps have improved in Q4.\n* Nothing particularly incremental surrounding some of the higher-profile themes outside of earnings. **Worsening coronavirus trends** in Europe and US continue to grab a lot of headlines and have raised concerns about recovery headwinds. **Election uncertainty** another overhang as Biden's lead in the polls offset by the potential for Trump to deliver another 2016 surprise. **Fiscal stimulus** on the backburner other than the seeming breakdown in the Pelosi-Mnuchin relationship. **Central bank policy support** another area of focus following the ECB though there also continue to be worries about both depleted arsenals and fatigue.\n\n**Notable Gainers:**\n\n* \\+6.2% **RMD-US** (ResMed): FQ1 earnings and revenue beat; noted sequential improvement in core apnea patient volume; analysts positive on better-than-expected sleep improvement amid declining Covid ventilator tailwinds; upgraded at JP Morgan.\n* \\+4.4% **ZEN-US** (Zendesk): Q3 EPS, revenue beat; billings, deferred revenue, cash from operations all better; guided Q4 revenue, operating income ahead of estimates; upgraded to buy from hold at Stifel, citing multi-year wave of digital upgrades in marketing, support.\n* \\+4.2% **GOOGL-US** (Alphabet): Big Q3 beat driven by increase in advertiser spend in Search and YouTube, along with continued strength in Google Cloud and Play; takeaways noted YouTube ad growth back near pre-pandemic levels (DR strong and brand spending rebounded); expense control another bright spot; Street also positive on company's plan to provide more disclosure on Google Cloud revenue and profitability.\n* \\+3% **FLEX-US** (Flex): Fiscal Q2 results ahead with company highlighting a coronavirus tailwind for health solutions, a rebound in auto, industrial growth from power solutions and renewables, and better networking and cloud growth (helped offset enterprise IT weakness); guidance ahead of expectations; Street also positive on update on NEXTracker solar business ($1B+ revenues and double digit operating margins).\n* \\+2.5% **CL-US** (Colgate-Palmolive): Q3 EPS, revenue beat; organic growth ahead on big Latin America, Europe upside; guided net and organic sales up MSD against consensus for 2.1% growth; also guided GM ahead; analysts noted GM expansion a record which allowed strong brand investments.\n* \\+2.4% **FIVN-US** (Five9): Q3 EPS, EBITDA, revenue beat on billings upside; announced acquisition of Inference Solutions, terms not disclosed; guided Q4 revenue midpoint ahead, EPS slightly better; upgraded to overweight from equal-weight at Stephens, citing improve revenue growth visibility, faster mid-market/enterprise adoption.\n* \\+1.6% **UAA-US** (Under Armour): Q3 revenue, operating income, EPS all ahead; guided FY20 EPS, revenue ahead of Street; management also highlighted margin growth vs 2019 on channel mix benefits, supply chain efficiencies; analysts positive on MyFitnessPal spinoff as sign of focus on core business, management focus on brand elevations and profitability.\n\n**Notable Decliners:**\n\n* \\-19.5% **TWTR-US** (Twitter): Q3 earnings and revenue beat on stronger advertising though monetizable daily active users sharply missed heightened expectations; noted favorable trends continued through October; analysts highlighted delay of MAP offering into 2021 due to new privacy standards, increased cost commentary for Q4 and pull forward of users during Q1/Q2.\n* \\-17% **COLM-US** (Columbia Sportswear): Q3 earnings and revenue missed with guidance below expectations; noted store traffic well below prior years, supply chain constraints related to Covid, cost containment actions; analysts highlighted weak implied gross margins in Q4 due to expected promotions though larger inventories than peers a potential benefit going into holiday season.\n* \\-9.3% **TEAM-US** (Atlassian): FQ1 earnings and revenue beat; new-customer growth and billings among the bright spots; next-Q guidance a bit weaker than the Street; analysts noted report generally positive but concerns about decelerating growth and lumpiness amid cloud transition.\n* \\-7.5% **MGM-US** (MGM Resorts): Q3 EPS and revenue missed; analysts characterized Las Vegas results as soft though Macau better; noted LV strip recovery remains highly uncertain due to reliance on air travel and group/convention business.\n* \\-6.1% **FB-US** (Facebook): Q3 beat big on key metrics with recovery in demand for digital ads the widely discussed tailwind on SMB, eComm, Retail, CPG strength; however, US and Canada users down and company warned they could fall more in Q4; also highlighted risks surrounding privacy changes, regulatory environment; guidance for a big investment ramp another overhang.\n* \\-5.3% **AAPL-US** (Apple): Sep Q revenue and EPS ahead but upside limited, iPhone revenue missed, China soft and company did not provide revenue guidance; however, other products beat (WFH tailwind) and company was positive on early iPhone 12 read-throughs; Street noted lack of guidance more of a supply issue, still expects a very powerful upgrade cycle and continued to talk up the favorable ecosystem narrative.\n* \\-4.2% **AMZN-US** (Amazon.com): Q3 revenue and operating profit well above consensus; however, Q4 operating income guide below with $4B of coronavirus costs vs $2B+ in Q3; also some focus on fulfillment productivity challenges; however, takeaways still positive, highlighting accelerated structural shift to eCommerce, strong Q4 sales guidance, stable AWS, advertising and subscription growth acceleration.\n\n10:01:07 AM CDT on 30 Oct '20",

    "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 26, 2020**\n\nLosses in the stock market accelerated today as new data showed an increased number of coronavirus infections in both Europe and the United States. In an effort to combat the disease, countries are once again putting restrictions in place, raising the concern of another lockdown that further harms global economic activity.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished the day down 1.82%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.5% down and the Dow Jones performed the worst (DIA) finishing 2.21%.\n\nUnfortunately, over the weekend, the US posted consecutive days of record high infection, with more than 80,000 new cases confirmed on Friday and Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. States in the Midwest of the US have been the most affected, most likely due to a resistance by the population to wear masks and colder temperatures.. Over the past seven days, the country reported an average of about 68,767 new cases every day, the highest seven-day average recorded yet, again according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worryingly, The seven-day average is up more than 22% compared to last week, an extremely worrying increase. Adjusted for population, the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Montana and Idaho are reporting more average daily new cases than anywhere else in the country. Sadly, Johns Hopkins University reported there were 225,111 COVID-19 related deaths across the country as of Sunday afternoon. By comparison, there were 291,557 American soldiers killed in battle during World War II, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nEurope is faring no better, with countries reporting a record number of infections over the weekend and announcing a host of new restrictions. On Sunday, France reported 52,000 positive cases, a record for the country. In response, two-thirds of the country has been placed under strict, 9 p.m. curfew. In Italy, 15,199 new cases of the virus were reported, well above the previous record of 11,705. In response, the Italian government has implemented restrictions, shutting down gyms, pools and movie theaters, putting an early curfew on cafes and restaurants and mandating that people keep wearing masks outdoors. Spain, which has also been struggling with a record number of infections, declared a nationwide state of emergency and imposed a curfew. \n\nWith the November election a mere 8 days away, the chances for the passage of additional virus-relief have all but disappeared. In a letter to her fellow Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the Republicans for the failure to act in the face of the pandemic, calling their response \u201carrogance\u201d. She said, \u201cThe Republicans\u2019 continued surrender to the virus - particularly amid the recent wave cases - is official malfeasance. We must come to an agreement as soon as possible. But we cannot accept the \\[Trump\\] administration\u2019s refusal to crush the virus, honor our heroes or put money in the pockets of the American people. That attitude clearly explains why the White House has not embraced the science-based path to crush the virus, which is contained in the Heroes Act.\u201d Democrats and the White House have most recently proposed $2.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion relief packages, respectively. Despite the similar target price tags for legislation, the sides still have not resolved disputes over testing, extra unemployment insurance, state and local government relief and liability protections for businesses, among other issues.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amid the rising number of coronavirus infections, stocks like hotels, cruise lines, and airlines that benefit from economic reopening, dropped steeply, underperforming the broader market in an already bad day.\n* AstraZeneca (AZN) announced that their vaccine candidate produced a robust immune response in elderly participants. AZN outperformed the market, up 2% at the time of writing. \n* Shares of Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) came under pressure after China said it would impose sanctions on the defense units of the companies following the U.S. approval of a $1.8 billion arms sale to Taiwan last week. China, which considers Taiwan to be part of its territory, has not yet specified the sanctions that will be put into place. Shares were down around 3% in average at the time of writing.\n* The parent company of Dunkin' and Baskin-Robbins (DNKN) said it has held early talks to go private in an acquisition by Inspire Brands Inc., whose portfolio includes Arby's, Buffalo Wild Wings and Jimmy John's chains.\n* Dunkin Brands Group $DNKN had price target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $83 to $106.50 at EQUAL WEIGHT, and from Robert W. Baird from $86 to $106 on the back of rumors that it will be acquired.\n* Activision Blizzard (ATVI) had a price target raise by JP Morgan (JPM) from $92 to $95 at OVERWEIGHT\n* Alibaba (BABA) had price target raise by Oppenheimer from $325 to $335 at OUTPERFORM\n* Bloomin' Brands (BLMN) had a price target raise by Morgan Stanley (MS) from $17 to $18 at EQUAL WEIGHT, by Deutsche Bank from $20 to $22 at bUY, and Credit Suisse from $12 to $17 at NEUTRAL\n* Electronic Arts (EA) had price target raise by JP Morgan (JPM) from $150 to $155 at OVERWEIGHT\n* Sunnova Energy International (NOVA) had a price target raised by Credit Suisse Group from $26 to $38 at OUTPERFORM. This is a huge call, and stock is only at $27! worth to keep an eye out.\n* Service Now (NOW) had a price target raise by Stifel Nicolaus from $500 to $550 at BUY\n* Pinterest (PINS) received a price target raise by KeyCorp from $44 to $60 at OVERWEIGHT\n* Turning Point Therapeutics (TPTX) with price target raises by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $88 to $133 at OVERWEIGHT, SVB Leering from $77 to $116 OUTPERFORM, and HC Wainwright from $100 to $130 at BUY\n* Visa (V) had a price target raised by Morgan Stanley (MS) from $211 to $228 at OVERWEIGHT.\n* Live Oak Bancshares (LOB) was upgraded by Raymond James from $27 to $42 from OUTPERFORM to STRONG BUY.\n* September new home sales were reported at an annual rate of 959,000, down from the 1.025 million expected by analysts.\n* Kandi Technologies $KNDI said it has formed a joint venture with China's Zhejiang Ruibo New Energy Vehicle Service Company and Jiangsu Jinpeng Group to offer ride-sharing services in China\n* Notable earnings after the bell: Twilio (TWLO), Chegg (CHGG), Alphabet/Google (GOOG), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), and Boyd Gaming (BYD) \n\n\u201cThe best way out is through\u201d -Robert Frost",

Despite the similar target price tags for legislation, the sides still have not resolved disputes over testing, extra unemployment insurance, state and local government relief and liability protections for businesses, among other issues.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amid the rising number of coronavirus infections, stocks like hotels, cruise lines, and airlines that benefit from economic reopening, dropped steeply, underperforming the broader market in an already bad day.\n* AstraZeneca (AZN) announced that their vaccine candidate produced a robust immune response in elderly participants.

Shares were down around 3% in average at the time of writing.\n* The parent company of Dunkin' and Baskin-Robbins (DNKN) said it has held early talks to go private in an acquisition by Inspire Brands Inc., whose portfolio includes Arby's, Buffalo Wild Wings and Jimmy John's chains.\n* Dunkin Brands Group $DNKN had price target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $83 to $106.50 at EQUAL WEIGHT, and from Robert W.

    "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 26th, 2020.\n\n# **There\u2019s a big week ahead for the market with an earnings deluge, GDP data and stimulus negotiations  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/theres-a-big-week-ahead-for-the-market-with-an-earnings-deluge-gdp-data-and-stimulus-negotiations.html)**\n*****\n&gt; About a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings, including Apple and Microsoft, but uncertainty around stimulus and the presidential election could loom larger for markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There is also important economic data on the calendar, with a first look at third-quarter gross domestic product Thursday. After the second quarter\u2019s shocking 31.4% decline following coronavirus shutdowns, the economy bounced back with growth of 32.5% expected in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly 170 companies report earnings in the coming week, with a diverse group of blue chips among them, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell, and Merck. There is also a big showing from large tech names. Microsoft reports Tuesday, and Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all report in a small window just after the market close on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFor some of these stocks that have run a long way, the bar for those stock to respond to good earnings is higher,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivative strategy at BTIG.\n*****\n&gt; So far about 85% of S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings beat estimates, about 20 percentage points more than the long term average. Companies have been reporting earnings more than 16% above estimates, and the expectation is that earnings overall will be down about 18%, based on actual results and forecasts, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.95% for the week, breaking a 3-week win streak as coronavirus fiscal negotiations dragged on and tech shares declined.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve offered compromises, the speaker on a number of issues is still dug in,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday. \u201cIf she wants to compromise, there will be a deal. But we\u2019ve made lots of progress in lots of areas, but there\u2019s still some significant areas that we\u2019re working through.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; His comments knocked stocks down a bit midday Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s been a muted reaction to earnings overall,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cSo I\u2019m disappointed, in a way, as a fundamentally focused chief investment officer, that the stimulus saga seems to be what it\u2019s all about day in and day out, hour by hour. It\u2019s the stimulus saga, the election looming and the Covid resurgence. Those three things have sort of made earnings a page four story.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; With a week to go before the Nov. 3 election, the market could be a bit more volatile, especially if the outcome looks increasingly less certain.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to focus on the state of stimulus. It\u2019s going to focus on whether the polls are tightening or widening with regard to the probability of having an unclear outcome, contested outcome or both,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s lead has narrowed slightly but he is still ahead in swing state polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe are experiencing a little bit of the calm before the storm here. I do think we are going to get some 1%, 2% daily moves depending on the news...I think you could see a 3% to 5% down opening the following day [after the election] pretty easily,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cI think the market has grown increasingly comfortable with a cleaner result, even if the cleaner result is an all blue result, which potentially would result in a higher tax regime.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market began to focus more on the possibility of a Democratic sweep, where Democrats take the White House and Congress. That could mean a bigger stimulus package, and some strategists believe tax hikes would be delayed until the economy is on more solid ground.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs we get closer to the election, we\u2019re likely to see more volatility no matter what the outcome,\u201d said Grohowski.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said investors are not adequately hedged for an uncertain outcome. \u201cActive managers have the most net long positions they\u2019ve had in a number of years because they\u2019re fearful of missing a year-end rally,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe options market in no way, shape or form is telling you people are hedged right here. The market is discounting a slight volatility, not expected to be persistent into year end.\u201d\n*****\nEmanuel said the options market indicates investors do expect some volatility but not through year end, as some investors began hedging for several months ago.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat we see by and large is again the bump in volatility. It\u2019s really only anticipating a 2% or 3% move in the market either way, after the election, and then the expectation is to likely moderate after that,\u201d Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; The final trading day of October is on Friday, so there could also be some added volatility as fund managers readjust their portfolios between bonds and stocks. In the past week, Treasury yields broke out of a four-month range. The 10-year yield rose above 0.80% for the first time since June, and while it could move higher, strategists expect its move to be contained.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/67jHHD1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/M13Rd10.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ROEcV0O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zqElHD7.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9iotJBk.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lrNGV86.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xGvBBYL.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tR0QKgZ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iXkAMua.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/80umQkP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4BQenwD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rZFBz4D.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq vs. Dow Outperformance\n\n&gt; You may not realize it, but while the Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up a ridiculous 28% so far in 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still in the red on the year.\n\n&gt; Below is a table showing the Dow and Nasdaq's annual percentage change since 1972 when the Nasdaq came into existence. Were the year to end now, the Nasdaq would be outperforming the Dow by 28.65 percentage points. This would be the third strongest outperformance for the Nasdaq on record and the strongest since 1999 when the spread was 60 percentage points!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/dowavg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/downazpctchg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/spreaduse.png))**\n\n&gt; Below are all years since 1972 in which the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by at least ten percentage points. The Nasdaq has posted an annual gain of 20%+ in seventeen different years, but never in a year when the Dow was in the red. Probably the year that most resembles 2020 in terms of the performance spread is 1979 when the Nasdaq rose 28.11% and the Dow rose just 4.19%. Following that year in 1980, both the Dow and Nasdaq surged again and the Nasdaq outperformed by another 18.9 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Interestingly, of the twelve years where the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by more than ten percentage points, the Nasdaq went on to beat the Dow again in the next year eleven out of twelve times. The only time we've seen the Nasdaq crumble versus the Dow in the following year was in 2000 after 1999's outperformance. In 1999, the Nasdaq beat the Dow by a humongous 60 percentage points. After that large gap, though, the Nasdaq ran out of gas in 2000 and underperformed the Dow by 33 percentage points when the Dot Com Bubble finally burst.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/outperfo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Show Slowing Pace of Economic Recovery\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) Beige Book presented qualitative data that suggested the pace of the economic recovery had been tapering, as we discussed in the LPL Research blog, Beige Book Shows Pace of Recovery is Moderating, but now we have quantitative data that is confirming the survey data. The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) increased 0.7% month over month in September to beat Bloomberg consensus expectations of 0.6%, but slowed after rising 1.4% in August and 2% in July.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the leading indicators are still growing, but at a slower rate than the blistering pace seen in the initial months after emerging from lockdowns.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.23.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Growth in the LEI in September was primarily driven by the improvement in jobless claims, as well as continued strength in building permits for new private housing\u2014a trend that matches the behavioral shifts to accommodate work from home conditions during the pandemic. The pullback in stock prices last month and manufacturers\u2019 new orders were the lone detractors from the LEI in September.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt comes as no surprise that growth began to level off after the surge over the summer, and the softer LEI print is suggesting the economy could be losing momentum heading into the fourth quarter,\u201d said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cHowever, despite the slowing momentum, we still expect solid economic growth in Q4, just not quite at the same rate in Q3.\u201d\n\n&gt; The decline in manufacturers\u2019 new orders is likely in relation to election uncertainty, which should prove transitory. However, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in both Europe and the United States may cause business activity to slow, even if no additional lockdowns are mandated. As we head into the fourth quarter, we will continue to monitor real-time data for any additional clues about the pace of the economic recovery.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Halloween Trading Strategy: S&amp;P 500 Up 85% of the Time\n\n&gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 26 years. From the tables above &amp; below:\n\n&gt; * Dow up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.05%.\n&gt; * S&amp;P up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.11%.\n&gt; * NASDAQ up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.67%.\n&gt; * Russell 2000 up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.31%.\n\n&gt; Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course \u201cSell in May\u201d. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac that most of the market\u2019s gains have been made from October 31 to April 30, while the market tends to go sideways to down from May through October.\n\n&gt; Recent market weakness has held off our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal so far, but it could trigger anytime now. Uncertainty abounds with surging covid-19 cases, a heated presidential election and persistently elevated unemployment. However, each day that passes is one day closer to a covid-19 vaccine. Interest rates are low and ample liquidity is available to support the market and the economy. Additional fiscal stimulus also appears to be coming soon. Debate continues on the amount, but both parties do appear to agree it is needed in one form or another.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/79a067fc10d5ee40688ccec4ecb3fe2d/5899f7da34b8b8c0-e3/s500x750/4b0222300348a79e152bf80a85a41faf34984e3e.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/120a6a895b102be90ac05d6d5cbcdf2a/5899f7da34b8b8c0-26/s500x750/94df00168310f90a644b7aaa6f94820f807a4080.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/545ec0f231cb05daf30bc162745dc559/5899f7da34b8b8c0-25/s500x750/d84cab3903b5c92e70d470a07c469e2d646d38b8.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a59dd0402f777bcb3f8fd3fb014a35ed/5899f7da34b8b8c0-82/s500x750/f54029e610ed2abc990f8b7c6ea9678925bc0a5a.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # \"Quitters\"\n\n&gt; Like an old pair of \"quitters\" that keep falling down because their elasticity is shot, the market has had its own trouble staying up over the last few trading days. Today isn't over yet, but if the S&amp;P 500 finishes around current levels it will mark the fourth straight day of finishing down at least half of one percent from its intraday high. Compared to the three days before, today's pullback from an intraday high has actually been pretty mild up to this point. Following Monday's 2%+ decline from the intraday high shortly after the open, yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 traded down close to 1% from its afternoon high. These two reversals followed Friday's late-day sell-off when the S&amp;P 500 finished the day down 0.75% from its intraday high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Last-Four-Days1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it's disheartening to see the market erasing early gains as the day goes on, it's helpful to put the last four trading days into perspective. Over the last 25 years, it hasn't been uncommon for the S&amp;P 500 to finish the day down at least 0.5% from an intraday high for four days in a row. The current streak, if it holds, would be the 158th such streak of four or more days. That works out to more than six a year. There have also been a number of streaks that were much longer than the current one. In fact, it was only a month ago that the S&amp;P 500 went 11 straight days of finishing the day down at least 0.5% from its intraday high, and besides that streak, there have been five other streaks that spanned ten or more trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Streaks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # October Optimism For Homebuilders\n\n&gt; Given housing inventories remain historically low thanks to still strong demand, homebuilders have plenty to be optimistic about. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has continued to show this strength as its monthly sentiment survey set a record high for the month of October. Back in August, the index tied the previous record level of 78 from December of 1998. Over the past two months, it has only raised that bar, coming in at 85 this month; 2 points above forecasts and last month's reading of 83.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The rise in the index comes on broad strength across each of the sub-indices. Present Sales, Future Sales, and Traffic all matched or made record highs in October. The only sub-index that was not higher was for Traffic, though, it was unchanged at a record high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Table1.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the look across each of the four US regions, the West and Northeast both saw sizeable upticks to new records, but sentiment in the Midwest and South were actually slightly lower. For the Northeast, this is the third record in a row. Meanwhile, the West's record high in October finally surpassed the prior high of 91 from October of 2005. Finally, even though sentiment fell in the Midwest and South, both remain at higher levels now than any month other than September's record highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Regions.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 23rd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.25.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$TWLO** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$FSLY** \n&gt; * **$PINS** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$MRNA** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$ETSY** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$LGND** \n&gt; * **$FVRR** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$RTX** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$OSTK** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$ATVI** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$SHW** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$NVS** \n&gt; * **$NRZ** \n&gt; * **$MRK**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8wcVG2D.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.26.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AaPzlgn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9GgF3Hb.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rwj1IS3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/k4Rx5gI.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YjH86d9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LUzqajk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/NcPneVZ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/AMyjDf6.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/312QBRU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/mjgt9Gs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZJ4Y4Vk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3pFmMuz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SZg9uyc.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IGm07VC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IRNiQEm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SLRmoZE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.30.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7OhLjkG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Apple, Inc. $115.04\n**Apple, Inc.

      "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 26th, 2020.\n\n# **There\u2019s a big week ahead for the market with an earnings deluge, GDP data and stimulus negotiations  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/theres-a-big-week-ahead-for-the-market-with-an-earnings-deluge-gdp-data-and-stimulus-negotiations.html)**\n*****\n&gt; About a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings, including Apple and Microsoft, but uncertainty around stimulus and the presidential election could loom larger for markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There is also important economic data on the calendar, with a first look at third-quarter gross domestic product Thursday. After the second quarter\u2019s shocking 31.4% decline following coronavirus shutdowns, the economy bounced back with growth of 32.5% expected in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly 170 companies report earnings in the coming week, with a diverse group of blue chips among them, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell, and Merck. There is also a big showing from large tech names. Microsoft reports Tuesday, and Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all report in a small window just after the market close on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFor some of these stocks that have run a long way, the bar for those stock to respond to good earnings is higher,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivative strategy at BTIG.\n*****\n&gt; So far about 85% of S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings beat estimates, about 20 percentage points more than the long term average. Companies have been reporting earnings more than 16% above estimates, and the expectation is that earnings overall will be down about 18%, based on actual results and forecasts, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.95% for the week, breaking a 3-week win streak as coronavirus fiscal negotiations dragged on and tech shares declined.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve offered compromises, the speaker on a number of issues is still dug in,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday. \u201cIf she wants to compromise, there will be a deal. But we\u2019ve made lots of progress in lots of areas, but there\u2019s still some significant areas that we\u2019re working through.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; His comments knocked stocks down a bit midday Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s been a muted reaction to earnings overall,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cSo I\u2019m disappointed, in a way, as a fundamentally focused chief investment officer, that the stimulus saga seems to be what it\u2019s all about day in and day out, hour by hour. It\u2019s the stimulus saga, the election looming and the Covid resurgence. Those three things have sort of made earnings a page four story.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; With a week to go before the Nov. 3 election, the market could be a bit more volatile, especially if the outcome looks increasingly less certain.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to focus on the state of stimulus. It\u2019s going to focus on whether the polls are tightening or widening with regard to the probability of having an unclear outcome, contested outcome or both,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s lead has narrowed slightly but he is still ahead in swing state polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe are experiencing a little bit of the calm before the storm here. I do think we are going to get some 1%, 2% daily moves depending on the news...I think you could see a 3% to 5% down opening the following day [after the election] pretty easily,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cI think the market has grown increasingly comfortable with a cleaner result, even if the cleaner result is an all blue result, which potentially would result in a higher tax regime.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market began to focus more on the possibility of a Democratic sweep, where Democrats take the White House and Congress. That could mean a bigger stimulus package, and some strategists believe tax hikes would be delayed until the economy is on more solid ground.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs we get closer to the election, we\u2019re likely to see more volatility no matter what the outcome,\u201d said Grohowski.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said investors are not adequately hedged for an uncertain outcome. \u201cActive managers have the most net long positions they\u2019ve had in a number of years because they\u2019re fearful of missing a year-end rally,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe options market in no way, shape or form is telling you people are hedged right here. The market is discounting a slight volatility, not expected to be persistent into year end.\u201d\n*****\nEmanuel said the options market indicates investors do expect some volatility but not through year end, as some investors began hedging for several months ago.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat we see by and large is again the bump in volatility. It\u2019s really only anticipating a 2% or 3% move in the market either way, after the election, and then the expectation is to likely moderate after that,\u201d Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; The final trading day of October is on Friday, so there could also be some added volatility as fund managers readjust their portfolios between bonds and stocks. In the past week, Treasury yields broke out of a four-month range. The 10-year yield rose above 0.80% for the first time since June, and while it could move higher, strategists expect its move to be contained.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/67jHHD1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/M13Rd10.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ROEcV0O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zqElHD7.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9iotJBk.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lrNGV86.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xGvBBYL.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tR0QKgZ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iXkAMua.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/80umQkP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4BQenwD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rZFBz4D.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq vs. Dow Outperformance\n\n&gt; You may not realize it, but while the Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up a ridiculous 28% so far in 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still in the red on the year.\n\n&gt; Below is a table showing the Dow and Nasdaq's annual percentage change since 1972 when the Nasdaq came into existence. Were the year to end now, the Nasdaq would be outperforming the Dow by 28.65 percentage points. This would be the third strongest outperformance for the Nasdaq on record and the strongest since 1999 when the spread was 60 percentage points!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/dowavg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/downazpctchg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/spreaduse.png))**\n\n&gt; Below are all years since 1972 in which the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by at least ten percentage points. The Nasdaq has posted an annual gain of 20%+ in seventeen different years, but never in a year when the Dow was in the red. Probably the year that most resembles 2020 in terms of the performance spread is 1979 when the Nasdaq rose 28.11% and the Dow rose just 4.19%. Following that year in 1980, both the Dow and Nasdaq surged again and the Nasdaq outperformed by another 18.9 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Interestingly, of the twelve years where the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by more than ten percentage points, the Nasdaq went on to beat the Dow again in the next year eleven out of twelve times. The only time we've seen the Nasdaq crumble versus the Dow in the following year was in 2000 after 1999's outperformance. In 1999, the Nasdaq beat the Dow by a humongous 60 percentage points. After that large gap, though, the Nasdaq ran out of gas in 2000 and underperformed the Dow by 33 percentage points when the Dot Com Bubble finally burst.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/outperfo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Show Slowing Pace of Economic Recovery\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) Beige Book presented qualitative data that suggested the pace of the economic recovery had been tapering, as we discussed in the LPL Research blog, Beige Book Shows Pace of Recovery is Moderating, but now we have quantitative data that is confirming the survey data. The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) increased 0.7% month over month in September to beat Bloomberg consensus expectations of 0.6%, but slowed after rising 1.4% in August and 2% in July.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the leading indicators are still growing, but at a slower rate than the blistering pace seen in the initial months after emerging from lockdowns.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.23.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Growth in the LEI in September was primarily driven by the improvement in jobless claims, as well as continued strength in building permits for new private housing\u2014a trend that matches the behavioral shifts to accommodate work from home conditions during the pandemic. The pullback in stock prices last month and manufacturers\u2019 new orders were the lone detractors from the LEI in September.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt comes as no surprise that growth began to level off after the surge over the summer, and the softer LEI print is suggesting the economy could be losing momentum heading into the fourth quarter,\u201d said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cHowever, despite the slowing momentum, we still expect solid economic growth in Q4, just not quite at the same rate in Q3.\u201d\n\n&gt; The decline in manufacturers\u2019 new orders is likely in relation to election uncertainty, which should prove transitory. However, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in both Europe and the United States may cause business activity to slow, even if no additional lockdowns are mandated. As we head into the fourth quarter, we will continue to monitor real-time data for any additional clues about the pace of the economic recovery.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Halloween Trading Strategy: S&amp;P 500 Up 85% of the Time\n\n&gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 26 years. From the tables above &amp; below:\n\n&gt; * Dow up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.05%.\n&gt; * S&amp;P up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.11%.\n&gt; * NASDAQ up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.67%.\n&gt; * Russell 2000 up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.31%.\n\n&gt; Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course \u201cSell in May\u201d. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac that most of the market\u2019s gains have been made from October 31 to April 30, while the market tends to go sideways to down from May through October.\n\n&gt; Recent market weakness has held off our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal so far, but it could trigger anytime now. Uncertainty abounds with surging covid-19 cases, a heated presidential election and persistently elevated unemployment. However, each day that passes is one day closer to a covid-19 vaccine. Interest rates are low and ample liquidity is available to support the market and the economy. Additional fiscal stimulus also appears to be coming soon. Debate continues on the amount, but both parties do appear to agree it is needed in one form or another.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/79a067fc10d5ee40688ccec4ecb3fe2d/5899f7da34b8b8c0-e3/s500x750/4b0222300348a79e152bf80a85a41faf34984e3e.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/120a6a895b102be90ac05d6d5cbcdf2a/5899f7da34b8b8c0-26/s500x750/94df00168310f90a644b7aaa6f94820f807a4080.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/545ec0f231cb05daf30bc162745dc559/5899f7da34b8b8c0-25/s500x750/d84cab3903b5c92e70d470a07c469e2d646d38b8.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a59dd0402f777bcb3f8fd3fb014a35ed/5899f7da34b8b8c0-82/s500x750/f54029e610ed2abc990f8b7c6ea9678925bc0a5a.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # \"Quitters\"\n\n&gt; Like an old pair of \"quitters\" that keep falling down because their elasticity is shot, the market has had its own trouble staying up over the last few trading days. Today isn't over yet, but if the S&amp;P 500 finishes around current levels it will mark the fourth straight day of finishing down at least half of one percent from its intraday high. Compared to the three days before, today's pullback from an intraday high has actually been pretty mild up to this point. Following Monday's 2%+ decline from the intraday high shortly after the open, yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 traded down close to 1% from its afternoon high. These two reversals followed Friday's late-day sell-off when the S&amp;P 500 finished the day down 0.75% from its intraday high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Last-Four-Days1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it's disheartening to see the market erasing early gains as the day goes on, it's helpful to put the last four trading days into perspective. Over the last 25 years, it hasn't been uncommon for the S&amp;P 500 to finish the day down at least 0.5% from an intraday high for four days in a row. The current streak, if it holds, would be the 158th such streak of four or more days. That works out to more than six a year. There have also been a number of streaks that were much longer than the current one. In fact, it was only a month ago that the S&amp;P 500 went 11 straight days of finishing the day down at least 0.5% from its intraday high, and besides that streak, there have been five other streaks that spanned ten or more trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Streaks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # October Optimism For Homebuilders\n\n&gt; Given housing inventories remain historically low thanks to still strong demand, homebuilders have plenty to be optimistic about. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has continued to show this strength as its monthly sentiment survey set a record high for the month of October. Back in August, the index tied the previous record level of 78 from December of 1998. Over the past two months, it has only raised that bar, coming in at 85 this month; 2 points above forecasts and last month's reading of 83.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The rise in the index comes on broad strength across each of the sub-indices. Present Sales, Future Sales, and Traffic all matched or made record highs in October.

    "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 13, 2020**\n\nStocks traded mostly lower today, losing some of yesterday\u2019s gains. Market participants are digesting the first batch of corporate earnings, special events from giants Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), and as usual, developments in Washington regarding fiscal stimulus.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished even on the day. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) 0.64% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.58%.\n\nEconomists and financial analysts expect companies within the S&amp;P 500 to post an aggregate earnings per share decline of 19.4% over this year. This estimate is higher than the 20.5% decline predicted back in the Spring. LPL Research said in a note, \u201cThe increase in analysts\u2019 earnings estimates reflects increased confidence in the outlook, even with the challenges Covid-19 still presents in terms of social distancing, various safety protocols, and shifting consumer behavior. We have been encouraged by recent data pointing to a continued steady reopening of the economy, and we believe the likelihood that additional lockdowns may meaningfully impair business activity remains very low.\n\nToday, in a letter, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the White House\u2019s new proposal for coronavirus aid, saying that \u201cin terms of addressing testing, tracing and treatment, what the Trump Administration has offered is wholly insufficient.\u201d After a day of promising developments yesterday, it appears stimulus negotiations have stalled once again. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel said his party was preparing a new, targeted package of \u201croughly $500 billion\u201d. However, Pelosi has stated in the past, in response to the airline relief bill, that she will not support targeted stimulus, only a comprehensive package. Over the weekend, the Trump administration called on Congress to pass a smaller $1.8 billion coronavirus relief bill as negotiations on a bigger package continue to run into roadblocks.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Today Apple announced a slate of new products, including the next generation of iPhones (the iPhone 12) that supports the burgeoning 5G network. It also announced a new smart home speaker and a new way to charge devices, called MagSafe, which lets charger, cases, and other accessories snap onto the back of the device using a magnet. The stock was down today, after rallying around 6% yesterday. \n* Today is Amazon Prime Day \"one-day only event filled with more deals than Black Friday, exclusively for Prime members around the globe.\" The world\u2019s largest online retailer is slashing the prices on a lot of popular items.\n* Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY) late-stage trial of its leading monoclonal antibody treatment for the coronavirus has been paused by U.S. health regulators over potential safety concerns, the company confirmed. The stock was more than 3.3% down at the time of writing. \n* Delta Airlines (DAL) reported worse than expected earnings in EPS and revenue. Stock was more than 2% down.\n   * EPS of -$3.30 vs -$3.10 estimate\n   * Revenue of $3.06 billion v $3.12 billion. \n* Big banks showed remarkable strength in earnings, despite the effects of the pandemic.\n   * Citigroup (C) reported EPS of $1.40 vs $0.77 estimate and Revenue of $17.3 billion vs $17.18 billion estimate. Stock was more than 4% down at the time of writing\n   * JP Morgan (JPM) reported EPS of $2.92 vs $1.86 estimate and Revenue of $29.90 billion vs $28.20 billion. Stock was around 1.5% down at the time of writing. \n* Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) better than expected earnings. The stock was 2.3% down at the time of writing.\n   * EPS $2.20 vs $1.98 estimate\n   * Revenue of $21.08 billion vs $20.15 billion estimate.\n   * The company late-stage coronavirus vaccine was paused after a participant reported an \u201cadverse event\u201d about 36 hours earlier, the company\u2019s chief financial officer said today\n* Boeing (BA) said Tuesday that it didn't win any new orders in September and delivered only 11 aircrafts this month, due to decreased demand in light of the pandemic.\n* Workhorse (WKHS) shares are around 12.8% after a USPS contract decision was reportedly delayed, prompting a stock downgrade from Roth Capital.\n* BMO Capital markets upgrades in the hotel space:\n   * Hilton Hotels (HLT) $72 to $89 from UNDERPERFORM to MARKET PERFORM\n   * Host Hotel Resorts (HST) from $12 to $14 from MARKET PERFORM to OUTPERFORM\n   * Marriott International (MAR) from $83 to $95 UNDERPERFORM to MARKET PERFORM\n* Foot Locker (FL) upgraded by Bank of America from $20 to $50 at BUY.\n* Jefferies Financial upgraded:\n   * Cubesmart (CUBE) from HOLD to BUY at $42\n   * Extra Space Storage (EXR) from HOLD to BUY and $121 to $135.\n* Disney (DIS) was upgraded by Loop Capital from HOLD to BUY at a price target of $150. Announced they are shifting strategy to streaming as the primary form of \n* entertainment!\n* Activision Blizzard (ATVI) was upgraded by the Royal Bank of Canada from HOLD to BUY and the price target raised to $90 from $75.\n* Zendesk (ZEN) had a target raised by the Royal Bank of Canada from $110 to $130 at OUTPERFORM.\n* Twilio (TWLO) had targets raised by Needham and Northland securities from $320 to $340 at BUY, and from $290 to $340 at OUTPERFORM. This stock is a monster!\n* TakeTwo Interactive (TTWO) had target raised by Deutsche Bank from $175 to $200 at BUY.\n* Peloton (PTON) had target raised by Robert W.

The S&amp;P (SPY) finished 1.59% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.87%.\n\nProspects for further fiscal stimulus coming from Congress has been a main point of interest for traders since the CARES Act, the first round of stimulus passed in March, ran out on July 31. Though prospects for additional passage before the November election are slim, recent reports of a $1.8 trillion proposal coming from the White House and renewed talks between Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Last week\u2019s meetings between the pair did not produce an agreement, both parties are optimistic that a deal will  be worked out. In an interview with CNN, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow offered an upbeat assessment of the negotiations, saying that \u201cthe bid and offer is narrowing somewhat between the two sides.\u201d While there is a large delta between both proposals, the fact that the White House is showing a willingness to negotiate and compromise is a good sign that negotiations are going forward in good faith. \n\nThird-quarter earnings begin in earnest this week. A host of big banks, including JP Morgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C), will report earnings tomorrow. Big banks, which have underperformed the broader market since the March bottom, will provide valuable information into the extent of the ongoing strain to the US economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nFor this earnings season, analysts expect companies to report more year-on-year declines in profits due to business difficulties arising from the pandemic. According to data collected by FactSet, consensus estimates predict a earnings per share decline of 20.5% over the last year for companies in the S&amp;P 500. This earnings season comes at a very interesting time, with the market primed for several market-moving events, including the possibility of vaccine and therapeutic breakthroughs to treat coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS), \u201cNew information on the election, vaccines, and upcoming 3Q earnings represent substantial cross-currents for equities during the next two months. However, the vaccine represents a more important factor than the election result for the recovery in S&amp;P 500 fundamentals. In short, the progress of the US economy depends more on developments surrounding the disease rather than political elections or candidate differences in restoring the broken fundamentals of the stock market. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day starts today at Midnight and runs through to Wed, Oct 14. Over the course of the two days, more than 1 million items will be discounted, including heavily discounted \u201cLightning Deals\u201d for prime members. \n* Tomorrow, Apple (AAPL) is expected to present the next generation of iPhones (iPhone 12) and its 5G capabilities.

If the benchmark rate were cut to less than zero, from the current 0.1%, commercial banks would have to pay the Bank of England to hold deposits for them. Policy makers have previously indicated that they were willing to consider negative interest rates amid the economic pressures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n* Deutsche Bank (DB) today had interesting price target raises today, it turned bullish on the following stocks: Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Snapchat (SNAP), Pinterest (PINS), Facebook (FB), and Twitter (TWTR).

    " **US equities lower: Dow (0.80%), S&amp;P 500 (0.78%), Nasdaq (0.91%), Russell 2000 (0.47%)**\n\n* US equities down in Friday morning trading, but off worst levels. Major indices remain on track to snap their four-week losing streak (the longest since August 2019). Most sectors down, with tech, energy, communication services, and consumer discretionary trailing (FAANGs all lower). Utilities, materials the only sector higher. Treasuries unchanged to a bit weaker with some curve steepening. Dollar weaker vs yen and sterling but better on the euro cross. Gold down 0.4%. WTI crude down 3.6% after falling more than 3.5% in the prior session.\n* Risk-off sentiment chalked up to news that **President Trump has tested positive for the coronavirus**. White House physician said president and First Lady, who also tested positive, were currently well and would remain at White House while they recovered. VP Pence has tested negative. **House passed $2.2T coronavirus stimulus bill** by a narrow margin after **Democrats and White House failed to reach a bipartisan compromise**. Pelosi highlighted priority differences with Republicans, but said she thought something would get done. **September nonfarm payrolls job growth undershot expectations**, though past months revised up and unemployment rate better than consensus.**Biden's 9-point lead over Trump unchanged** in post-debate Reuters/Ipsos poll. Bloomberg discussed **possible return of Nasdaq whale** on Thursday.\n* Not much corporate news. **TSLA-US** Q3 deliveries beat consensus, but stock pulling back after strong recent run. WSJ reported Trian has taken big stakes in asset management firms **IVZ-US** and **JHG-US** and will push for consolidation. Bloomberg said **GM-US** considering boosting stake in **NKLA-US** in reworked deal. **TWLO-US** said Q3 revenue will be above the previously guided range. **GS-US** reportedly won bidding war for the GM credit card. **ATVI-US** delayed *World of Warcraft: Shadowlands* release but said move would have no material impact on financial results. **NUS-US** issued an upside pre-announcement. **LEN-US** doubled its quarterly dividend.\n\n**Notable Gainers:**\n\n* \\+42.0% **NNOX-US** (Nano-X Imaging): Announced it would hold a live demonstration of its Nanox.ARC system at the RSNA 2020 conference in November; analysts noted this could allay some concerns about company's novel technology.\n* \\+15.6% **JHG-US** (Janus Henderson Group): WSJ reported Trian Fund Management has accumulated a 9.9% stake in both JHG and IVZ-US and plans to agitate for deals aimed at building a rival to some of the world's largest asset managers.\n* \\+12.7% **TWLO-US** (Twilio): Noted Q3 revenue will be ahead of previously issued guidance; however, did not provide any additional details; Street also highlighted a number of positive takeaways from company's recent analyst day, including 30%+ organic revenue growth guide over the next four years.\n* \\+8.0% **NUS-US** (Nu Skin Enterprises): Positive Q3 pre-announcement; cited tailwind from current environment where consumers are spending more time online and working from home; upgraded to neutral from underperform at BofA.\n* \\+7.3% **HMST-US** (Homestreet): Upgraded to outperform from market perform at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods; cited catalysts including share repurchases, strong mortgage banking results, positive near-term NIM expansion, and core expense improvements.\n* \\+5.8% **PACB-US** (Pacific Biosciences of California): Upgraded to overweight from neutral at JPMorgan; noted additional confidence after recent management meeting, firm focused on salesforce expansion, diagnostic partnerships, product development; price target increased.\n* \\+2.6% **PAYC-US** (Paycom Software): Upgraded to buy from hold at Stifel; said HCM checks showed strong new sales activity over last several weeks; argued customers may be using Covid crisis to accelerate upgrade of HCM solutions with modern cloud platforms.\n\n**Notable Decliners:**\n\n* \\-9.3% **SGH-US** (SMART Global Holdings): Q4 revenue fell short though earnings beat slightly and guidance was mixed; analysts noted gross margin and OEPX guidance weaker, though sales guide ahead; Specialty Compute, and Brazil businesses showed some strength.\n* \\-5.4% **DXCM-US** (Dexcom): Downgraded to underweight from equal weight at Wells Fargo; argued recent approval of ABT-US 's Libre 3 in Europe will pressure DXCM's pricing; noted multiple improvements in Libre 3 to size, accuracy, and ease of use.\n* \\-2.3% **TSLA-US** (Tesla): Q3 deliveries ahead of consensus with both Model S/X and Model 3/Y better; analyst takes broadly positive; however expectations were high and stock weaker amid today's risk-off backdrop; TSLA up more than 400% YTD.\n* \\-1.4% **ATVI-US** (Activision Blizzard): Delayed release of World of Warcraft: Shadowlands until \"later this year\"; said game undergoing extended beta testing and extra work needed to meet high expectations; expects no material financial impact from the delay.\n* \\-1.1% **NVDA-US** (NVIDIA): Removed from Best Ideas list at Wedbush; cited valuation, with share prices incorporating near-term positive trends, don't see longer-term valuations justified without emergence of significant new market; also noted pessimism over regulatory approval of ARM acquisition.\n\n09:26:10 AM CDT on 02 Oct '20",

    "So I jumped in the market early this year. I've started with some ETFs and then moved to some growth and dividend stocks of companies or industries I'm interested in or knowledgeable about. I feel like I went too far with 23 positions (although 3 are very small) and want to grow or consolidate some of them (buy more, not sell, recommendations welcome). I keep seeing opportunities and still have individual companies im interested in investing but know I'm potentially missing out on gainz with over diversification. Still have 30+yrs until retirement age. Also feel i could be slightly overexposed in my industry - Tech/telecom makes up 46% (25% and 21%), 3rd heaviest is real estate at 18.5%. \n\nBelow are full weighting with my thought process notes. I realize there's some overlap with the individual picks and sector ETFs - which should i prioritize at this point?\n\n Thoughts, advice? TIA\n\nVOO 14.87% - core holding\nGD 9.58% - dividend/defense trends \nQCOM 8.09% - 5G play\nCCI 5.84% - dividend \nVBR 5.55% - small cap exposure \nIWP 5.09% - mid cap exposure \nATVI 4.88% - growth play \nTTWO 4.83% - growth play\nDLR 4.41% - dividend/company\nFTNT 4.29%- growth play\nTMUS 4.05%- growth play/company\nCSCO 3.64% - dividend/company\nT 3.53% - dividend \nXLI 3.36% - industrials exposure, like the holdings\nXLRE 3.25%- additional RE exposure\nXLF 3.01%- financials exposure\nSPG 2.98% dividend and high bounce back potential \nXLK 2.72%- additional exposure tech growth\nXLC 1.79%- like the holdings \nRDS.B 1.72% - international, worst pick, down 30%\nNRZ 1.87% - dividend \nNTNX 0.67% - growth play",

      "selftext": "So I jumped in the market early this year. I've started with some ETFs and then moved to some growth and dividend stocks of companies or industries I'm interested in or knowledgeable about. I feel like I went too far with 23 positions (although 3 are very small) and want to grow or consolidate some of them (buy more, not sell, recommendations welcome). I keep seeing opportunities and still have individual companies im interested in investing but know I'm potentially missing out on gainz with over diversification. Still have 30+yrs until retirement age. Also feel i could be slightly overexposed in my industry - Tech/telecom makes up 46% (25% and 21%), 3rd heaviest is real estate at 18.5%. \n\nBelow are full weighting with my thought process notes. I realize there's some overlap with the individual picks and sector ETFs - which should i prioritize at this point?\n\n Thoughts, advice?

    "I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -&gt; Aug. \n\nI beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180-&gt;300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)\n\nI did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. \n\nI did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. \n\n#High level advice:\n=========================================\n\nhttps://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/37-top-10-pieces-of-investment-advice-from-warren-buffett\n\nI picked the 7 I agree with.\n\n1. Invest in what you know\u2026and nothing more.\n2. Never compromise on business quality\n3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever\n4. Diversification can be dangerous\n5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)\n8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)\n10. Only listen to those you know and trust \n\nI firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  \n\n#General mindset:\n================\n- Keep emotions out of the market\n- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.\n- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. \n- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. \n- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)\n- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. \n\n#Application:\n==================================================================\nI was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. \n\nAs a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. \n\nBased on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good \"feel\" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). \n\nI tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. \n\nPost COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.\n\nMy hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. \n\n1. eCommerce + AdTech \n2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)\n3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)\n\nThese are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:\n\n1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?\n2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?\n3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? \n4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?\n5. Who are their customers and target demographic?\n6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.\n\nIn March, I took what I believe to be an \"educated gamble\". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.\n\nI have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.\n\nHere are the non FAANGs I chose.\n\n1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&amp;M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. \n\n2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.\n\n3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. \n\n4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.\n\n5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. \n\n6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.\n\n7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. \"Zoom parties\" and \"Zoom dates\" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.\n\n8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. \n\n10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.\n\n11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. \n\n12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. \n\n13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say \"Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?\" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.\n\n14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.\n\nMutual funds/ETFs\n1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. \n\n2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. \n\n3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... \n\nTitanvest:\nI was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.\n\n#Some things I do that that are against the grain:\n\n- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.\n\n- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.\n\n- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. \n\nOne example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. \n\nLastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. \n\nAlso, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",

I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.\n\nHere are the non FAANGs I chose.\n\n1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&amp;M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. \n\n2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.\n\n3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. \n\n4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.\n\n5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. \n\n6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.\n\n7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. \"Zoom parties\" and \"Zoom dates\" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.\n\n8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. \n\n10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.\n\n11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. \n\n12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. \n\n13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say \"Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?\" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.\n\n14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.\n\nMutual funds/ETFs\n1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. \n\n2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. \n\n3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... \n\nTitanvest:\nI was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.\n\n#Some things I do that that are against the grain:\n\n- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.\n\n- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.\n\n- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. \n\nOne example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. \n\nLastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. \n\nAlso, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",

    "I'm hoping some of you can share a bit of advice for a novice. Be brutal. If you think I'm not cut out, let me know. I want to learn, but hopefully not lose too much in the process!\n\nI got on to Revolut a couple of months ago. Bought Delta, SW and MGM thinking they'll go back up after coronavirus. Obviously things have gotten a little worse in the US and those stocks kept dropping. Got impatient, sold and lost money. \n\nMy next venture... Virgin Galactic. Initially bought in around $15, they went up, got excited, continued to plow money in, buying again at$21- $24. Pinned all my hopes on their quarterly earnings thinking they would hit $30... Didn't happen, panicked and sold, again losing more money.\n\nWhat I've learnt is I'm buying stocks without any consideration for the price. My thinking is always \"buy quick before they go up, in a few months time they'll be worth more, so I don't want to miss out\". This is obviously a laughable approach.\n\nMy latest venture is Nio. It's the only stock I own at the minute. Bought in multiple times at $13.37 \u2013 $14.07. Again absolutely no consideration for an entry point.\n\nI'm not so much interested in making a quick buck, my strategy is long term. Ideally I want to have 3-4 stocks that I invest in each month. Then at the end of the year, I take a bit of money out.\n\nMy problem is, I keep chopping and changing. I don't know what companies to pick. I have no problem doing the research, I've got a genuine interest in this stuff, I really like AMD, SPCE, NET, GPS, ATVI, PINS and a bunch of others on my watchlist. But because I'm not investing loads of money, when I see stocks $40+ I'm put off because I think I won't make much of a return.\n\nIs it best to put money aside for investing, but then set price targets for the stocks I like, and then buy in?\n\nI'm completely aware that I'm impulsive and if you haven't already gathered I come from a gambling background. I've certainly learnt, stocks and gambling are way way different.\n\nAny kind of advice/strategy you could share would be much appreciated.\n\nIs NIO a safe bet!?\n\nThanks,\nJason",

    "COD Moblie is finally approved in China! It's been a year since their partner Tencent applied for COD Mobile's license, it's really hard to get licensing for video games in China since the licensing rules reform.\n\nThink about that crappy PUBG Moblie has almost 30m players in China, this approval is likely gonna bring at least 30M new players for COD francise, thats almost the same as the Bllizzard's whole MAU base.\n\nBTW, I am super bullish that Diablo Mobile(coming this year) and D4 are gonna add tremendous amount of players to Blizzard's MAU base (Blizzard's lagging MAU is probably the reason ATVI was down yesterday). So their future looks bright to me.\n\n\nSource: There's no English news report yet since the Chinese gov just annouced it, heres the chinese link:\nhttps://inews.hket.com/article/2717152/%E3%80%90%E9%87%8D%E7%A3%85%E6%89%8B%E9%81%8A%E3%80%91%E9%A8%B0%E8%A8%8A%E3%80%8A%E4%BD%BF%E5%91%BD%E5%8F%AC%E5%96%9A%E6%89%8B%E9%81%8A%E3%80%8B%E3%80%81%E7%B6%B2%E6%98%93%E3%80%8A%E5%93%88",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/the-jobs-report-and-congressional-politics-may-matter-more-for-markets-than-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The market could lose some of its exuberance in the week ahead as the calendar turns to August, and investors await Friday\u2019s July employment report and keep their eyes on Washington.\n*****\n&gt; The focus will also be squarely on politicians, as Congress struggles to find a middle ground on a new fiscal spending package and decide the fate of the $600 a week unemployment supplement that was set to expire July 31. Former vice president Joe Biden is also expected to name his running mate in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; The jobs data will be crucial, particularly since the number of people filing for unemployment benefits has been edging higher, instead of falling back, as expected. According to Refinitiv, about 1.36 million new jobs are expected, well below the 4.8 million added in June, and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.7% from 11.1%.\n*****\n&gt; Trading around the report could be volatile, since some economists expect more than 2 million jobs were added, and some even see flat or negative payrolls.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have done well for the month of July, with the S&amp;P 500 finishing at 3,271, a gain of 5.5%. The Nasdaq has performed the best, rising 6.8% for the month to 10,745, after a 3.7% gain for the past week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAugust has traditionally been a challenging month for investors,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The market is entering what historically has been the worst two months for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; According to Stovall, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher in August 53% of the time, and its average move is a gain of just 0.01%, going back to World War II. September is worse, down 0.51% on average, and up just 48% of the time.\n*****\n&gt; In presidential election years, however the odds for August gains are better, as it rose 63% of the time and 73%, when the incumbent is up for re-election.\n*****\n&gt; There are also about 120 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, but the big earnings show for markets was this past week when four of the five biggest tech giants all reported Thursday afternoon. Three of those stocks \u2014 Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 surged, helping Nasdaq outperform Friday with a more than 1.5% gain.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings scorecard\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re only a month into the reporting period, and things are going to become less and less important from an earnings perspective,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cI think investors are sort of disappointed in that the bar was set so low for second quarter earnings that expectations were that we were going to see a lot of companies beat, which we have. But we were also going to see a gradual uplift of earnings expectations for forward quarters. We\u2019re not seeing that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Eighty-two percent of the companies reporting so far have beaten estimates, well above the average 65%, according to Refinitiv. The earnings decline is now looking closer to 33% from an initial 40%, and tech, which has been leading the market is one of the best performers. Profits for the sector now look to be up 1.4%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Because the tech names have contributed so much to market gains, their earnings were an important test for the market, and they didn\u2019t disappoint. But they didn\u2019t manage to pull up the whole market very far on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Among the names reporting in the coming week are a diverse group, including Disney, ViacomCBS, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Berkshire Hathaway, AIG, Clorox, and Wayfair, to name a few.\n*****\n&gt; # Politics now in play\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings story is over. My call had been once we had gotten through the earnings season, we would be more vulnerable to a sustainable pullback,\u201d said Barry Knapp, Ironside Macroeconomics managing partner and director of research. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s volatility season, but it\u2019s also an election year. ... We\u2019re more vulnerable to that next week and earnings won\u2019t hold us up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said if President Donald Trump and Republicans do not begin to perform better in the polls by Labor Day, the market is likely to focus on what a Democratic win would mean for taxes and regulation. That could be a negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf he hasn\u2019t made headway by then, it\u2019s likely he\u2019s done.That\u2019s about the point when things become pretty set in stone. The market will presume that\u2019s the case,\u201d Knapp said.\n*****\n&gt; The politics of the stimulus package could also reverberate through markets, until it looks like the Senate Republicans and House Democrats can find common ground.\n*****\n&gt; The two sides look to be at a standoff, but an agreement is still expected in early August. The market is particularly watching to see what happens with the enhanced unemployment benefits. Republicans have proposed cutting it to $200, but Democrats support keeping it.\n*****\n&gt; # The economy\n&gt; Cutting the size of the payments back might be good for the labor market and persuade more workers to return to work, some strategists say. However, there is also concern that the funding has helped stimulate the economy and keep the unemployed from defaulting on loans and payments. Consumer spending on goods in June was even higher than last year, and that was also seen as getting a lift from stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the jobs report, there are other important data like ISM manufacturing on Monday. There are also monthly vehicle sales Monday, and ISM nonmanufacturing data Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the macro data is going to be fine next week,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cI\u2019m not in the camp that thinks the payroll number is going to be negative.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; NatWest Markets economist Kevin Cummins is one of the economists who expects the jobs gains to be much smaller than the past two months. He expects the payrolls to come in at just 200,000. \u201cYou look at jobless claims, and you see a stalling out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Fed is right. There is significant downside risk to the economy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # A trade to watch\n&gt; Treasury yields, in the 2-year to 7-year range, fell to new lows in the past week. The 10-year yield, not yet at a record low, was also falling and was at 0.53% Friday. At the same time, the dollar was down more than 1% on the week and 4% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Gold was a beneficiary of the lower interest rates, weaker dollar trade, rising about 5% for the week and 10% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Strategist say investors are reacting to super-low interest rates, concerns about the economy, and the possibility that huge government spending will send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Investors are also jumping into inflation-protected bonds. According to Refinitiv\u2019s Lipper, inflation-protected bond funds took in $271 million of net new money for the fund-flows week ended July 29, the sixth week of gains. About $1 billion went into the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, (GLD) in the last week, Lipper said.\n*****\n&gt; During this time period, the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities funds recorded their two best weekly net inflows ever with increases of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the fund-flows weeks of June 24 and July 1.\n*****\n&gt; Lipper said investors started to put money into TIPS funds in the middle of the second quarter, and the flows have been . net positive in 11 out of 13 weeks since the beginning of May. This its second-worst quarterly net outflows ever as oil prices slumped in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this is going to be a much more inflationary decade. It will start out slowly. [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell is right that more forces are putting downward pressure on inflation at present. But the market looks past that,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cThe big story in 2021 will be the recovery of inflation. You\u2019re already seeing it in import prices.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Vu3udbe.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/h0BBbe1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LKORgeK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/MZnSQFC8/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LhH7odo.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/p9QIWyG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HmN0IBf.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZlnNJZU.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/wvkv3FfP/er83720.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vu4Bq8q.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/kKZeaRL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/O6zeqaG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SkGddqX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/5XLqRrO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/zl5gQpo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August: Top NASDAQ &amp; Russell 2000 Month of Election Years\n\n&gt; August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 32 years, 1988-2019 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.\n\n&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%\u2014which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts\u2019 average decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e8afe7e1e8656f8b9beeaf3291cf8f62/02ca1964ef3531ea-f0/s400x600/77f035157f33a261b7608dc9cc36fc09a768f385.jpg))**\n\n&gt; However, in election years since 1950, Augusts\u2019 rankings improve: #6 DJIA, #5 S&amp;P 500, #1 NASDAQ (since 1971), #1 Russell 1000 and #1 Russell 2000 (since 1979). This year, the market\u2019s performance in August will likely depend heavily on how July closes and whether or not the rate of covid-19 infection continues to accelerate which could force some areas to roll back reopenings.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August\u2019s First Trading Day Bearish Last 23 Years\n\n&gt; From the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 (page 88), it is known that the first trading days of each month combined gain nearly as much as all other days combined. However, the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2020 Almanac. In the past 23 years DJIA has risen just 30.4% (up 7, down 16) of the time on the first trading day of August. Average and median losses are on the mild side due to a few sizable advances. Over the past nine years, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have both declined nine times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8f6234b8e365d9e861563b4d5b2efa5d/42d5f6b50757b324-8c/s500x750/6269fe4480533724c565c9852bf543a4c59ea172.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Stronger Underneath the Surface\n\n&gt; Earlier today we posted a chart showing S&amp;P 500 sector performance since the Nasdaq's recent peak on 7/20 when Technology stocks began what has now been a 10-day period of consolidation. Below we have updated these performance numbers to include today's moves. While not as many sectors remain in positive territory, the majority of sectors continue to outperform the S&amp;P 500, while Technology drags the market lower. Along with Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary are the only other sectors that have lagged the S&amp;P 500, and their performance has been dragged down by the mega-cap tech-like stocks of Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Expanding on this theme of underlying strength in the index, the chart below shows the average performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 grouped by sector. On an equal-weighted basis, the S&amp;P 500 is actually up 1.3% since 7/20, and only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen negative average returns. On the upside, Real Estate (4.1%) has been the big winner followed by Consumer Discretionary (3.3%), and Consumer Staples (2.2%). The fact that Consumer Discretionary at the cap-weighted sector level is down over 1.4% while the average performance of stocks in the sector has been a gain of 3.3% illustrates what a mammoth impact AMZN has on that sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Breadth among S&amp;P 500 stocks has also been overwhelmingly positive. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, 59% of stocks in the index have had positive returns since the close on 7/20. Only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen fewer than half of their components post positive returns over that time, while Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Utilities have seen roughly three-quarters of their components rally since 7/20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Percent-Up1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far\n\n&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**\n\n&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/eps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # China Running Away YTD\n\n&gt; Every Wednesday, we publish our Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high-level summary of market and economic data of some of the world's largest economies. Of the 23 stock markets tracked, just six including the US are positive year to date at the moment (in local currency). In the chart below we show the YTD performance of these six countries as well as the global median in 2020. As shown, even though it was actually the first to tip into the green YTD following the global sell-off in February and March very briefly back in early June, the US is up the least of this group with a YTD gain of 0.4%. China's stock market is up the most at +14%. Taiwan, South Korea, South Africa, and Malaysia are also outperforming the US but are up more modestly than China with the best of these, Taiwan, gaining 4.53% this year. Meanwhile, the median country in our Global Macro Dashboard remains down 6.2% YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-GMD-ytd.png))**\n\n&gt; Given it is up the most on a year to date basis, China has also gained the largest share of global equity market cap in 2020. As shown in the table below, China has gained 1.7 percentage points of global market cap in 2020 and now takes up 10.14%. China now joins the US as the only other country with a double-digit share of total world market cap. Despite this, China has actually lost share since the bear market lows on 3/23. Meanwhile, the US, Germany, Canada, India, South Korea, and Australia have all gained a significant share since 3/23.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-Mkt-Cap-World.png))**\n\n&gt; # Do the Top 5 Stocks Pose a Risk to the Market?\n\n&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. These five stocks have helped spawn a number of acronyms as they try to capture the rise of mega-cap tech stocks that have led the market higher for much of the past decade. The average return for those five stocks so far this year has been a gain of more than 30%, while the broad S&amp;P 500 Index is just marginally positive, at 0.4% through July 30.\n\n&gt; While many other areas of the market have remained largely static, the total market value of these stocks has dramatically increased, making them an increasingly large piece of market cap-weighted indexes such as the S&amp;P 500. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the combined weight of the top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 has increased to its highest level ever, at nearly 22%. Only one of those five stocks (Microsoft) was a top five name in the index during the previous peak of March 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But does this pose a risk to the index? From a diversification standpoint, one could certainly argue it does. For instance, if any shared risks should come up, from regulation, for example, it could do outsized damage to cap-weighted indexes. However, we believe that the recent gains have been justified by the fundamentals, and we continue to favor both large caps over small caps, and growth-style stocks over value stocks. According to analysis from Credit Suisse, over the past 12 months, the top five stocks in the index have grown revenues at 11.2% vs. just 0.8% for the rest of the S&amp;P 500. Further, the remainder of the S&amp;P 500 has subtracted roughly $17 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS), while the top five stocks have added more than $12.\n\n&gt; Finally, while these stocks have been the face of the recent \u201cstay-at-home trend\u201d and may be more insulated from broader economic weakness, they are far from the only stocks making money this year. On July 30, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index hit a new all-time high and is now up more than 15% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; \u201cAfter a huge run, many of these top stocks may be due for a pause,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, looking out over the next 6 to 12 months, we believe that investors will continue to place a premium on companies that are able to organically grow sales, especially in a low-growth environment.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

      "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/the-jobs-report-and-congressional-politics-may-matter-more-for-markets-than-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The market could lose some of its exuberance in the week ahead as the calendar turns to August, and investors await Friday\u2019s July employment report and keep their eyes on Washington.\n*****\n&gt; The focus will also be squarely on politicians, as Congress struggles to find a middle ground on a new fiscal spending package and decide the fate of the $600 a week unemployment supplement that was set to expire July 31. Former vice president Joe Biden is also expected to name his running mate in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; The jobs data will be crucial, particularly since the number of people filing for unemployment benefits has been edging higher, instead of falling back, as expected. According to Refinitiv, about 1.36 million new jobs are expected, well below the 4.8 million added in June, and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.7% from 11.1%.\n*****\n&gt; Trading around the report could be volatile, since some economists expect more than 2 million jobs were added, and some even see flat or negative payrolls.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have done well for the month of July, with the S&amp;P 500 finishing at 3,271, a gain of 5.5%. The Nasdaq has performed the best, rising 6.8% for the month to 10,745, after a 3.7% gain for the past week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAugust has traditionally been a challenging month for investors,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The market is entering what historically has been the worst two months for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; According to Stovall, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher in August 53% of the time, and its average move is a gain of just 0.01%, going back to World War II. September is worse, down 0.51% on average, and up just 48% of the time.\n*****\n&gt; In presidential election years, however the odds for August gains are better, as it rose 63% of the time and 73%, when the incumbent is up for re-election.\n*****\n&gt; There are also about 120 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, but the big earnings show for markets was this past week when four of the five biggest tech giants all reported Thursday afternoon. Three of those stocks \u2014 Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 surged, helping Nasdaq outperform Friday with a more than 1.5% gain.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings scorecard\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re only a month into the reporting period, and things are going to become less and less important from an earnings perspective,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cI think investors are sort of disappointed in that the bar was set so low for second quarter earnings that expectations were that we were going to see a lot of companies beat, which we have. But we were also going to see a gradual uplift of earnings expectations for forward quarters. We\u2019re not seeing that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Eighty-two percent of the companies reporting so far have beaten estimates, well above the average 65%, according to Refinitiv. The earnings decline is now looking closer to 33% from an initial 40%, and tech, which has been leading the market is one of the best performers. Profits for the sector now look to be up 1.4%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Because the tech names have contributed so much to market gains, their earnings were an important test for the market, and they didn\u2019t disappoint. But they didn\u2019t manage to pull up the whole market very far on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Among the names reporting in the coming week are a diverse group, including Disney, ViacomCBS, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Berkshire Hathaway, AIG, Clorox, and Wayfair, to name a few.\n*****\n&gt; # Politics now in play\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings story is over. My call had been once we had gotten through the earnings season, we would be more vulnerable to a sustainable pullback,\u201d said Barry Knapp, Ironside Macroeconomics managing partner and director of research. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s volatility season, but it\u2019s also an election year. ... We\u2019re more vulnerable to that next week and earnings won\u2019t hold us up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said if President Donald Trump and Republicans do not begin to perform better in the polls by Labor Day, the market is likely to focus on what a Democratic win would mean for taxes and regulation. That could be a negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf he hasn\u2019t made headway by then, it\u2019s likely he\u2019s done.That\u2019s about the point when things become pretty set in stone. The market will presume that\u2019s the case,\u201d Knapp said.\n*****\n&gt; The politics of the stimulus package could also reverberate through markets, until it looks like the Senate Republicans and House Democrats can find common ground.\n*****\n&gt; The two sides look to be at a standoff, but an agreement is still expected in early August. The market is particularly watching to see what happens with the enhanced unemployment benefits. Republicans have proposed cutting it to $200, but Democrats support keeping it.\n*****\n&gt; # The economy\n&gt; Cutting the size of the payments back might be good for the labor market and persuade more workers to return to work, some strategists say. However, there is also concern that the funding has helped stimulate the economy and keep the unemployed from defaulting on loans and payments. Consumer spending on goods in June was even higher than last year, and that was also seen as getting a lift from stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the jobs report, there are other important data like ISM manufacturing on Monday. There are also monthly vehicle sales Monday, and ISM nonmanufacturing data Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the macro data is going to be fine next week,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cI\u2019m not in the camp that thinks the payroll number is going to be negative.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; NatWest Markets economist Kevin Cummins is one of the economists who expects the jobs gains to be much smaller than the past two months. He expects the payrolls to come in at just 200,000. \u201cYou look at jobless claims, and you see a stalling out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Fed is right. There is significant downside risk to the economy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # A trade to watch\n&gt; Treasury yields, in the 2-year to 7-year range, fell to new lows in the past week. The 10-year yield, not yet at a record low, was also falling and was at 0.53% Friday. At the same time, the dollar was down more than 1% on the week and 4% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Gold was a beneficiary of the lower interest rates, weaker dollar trade, rising about 5% for the week and 10% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Strategist say investors are reacting to super-low interest rates, concerns about the economy, and the possibility that huge government spending will send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Investors are also jumping into inflation-protected bonds. According to Refinitiv\u2019s Lipper, inflation-protected bond funds took in $271 million of net new money for the fund-flows week ended July 29, the sixth week of gains. About $1 billion went into the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, (GLD) in the last week, Lipper said.\n*****\n&gt; During this time period, the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities funds recorded their two best weekly net inflows ever with increases of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the fund-flows weeks of June 24 and July 1.\n*****\n&gt; Lipper said investors started to put money into TIPS funds in the middle of the second quarter, and the flows have been . net positive in 11 out of 13 weeks since the beginning of May. This its second-worst quarterly net outflows ever as oil prices slumped in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this is going to be a much more inflationary decade. It will start out slowly. [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell is right that more forces are putting downward pressure on inflation at present. But the market looks past that,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cThe big story in 2021 will be the recovery of inflation. You\u2019re already seeing it in import prices.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Vu3udbe.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/h0BBbe1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LKORgeK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/MZnSQFC8/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LhH7odo.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/p9QIWyG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HmN0IBf.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZlnNJZU.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/wvkv3FfP/er83720.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vu4Bq8q.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/kKZeaRL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/O6zeqaG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SkGddqX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/5XLqRrO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/zl5gQpo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August: Top NASDAQ &amp; Russell 2000 Month of Election Years\n\n&gt; August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 32 years, 1988-2019 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.\n\n&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%\u2014which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts\u2019 average decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e8afe7e1e8656f8b9beeaf3291cf8f62/02ca1964ef3531ea-f0/s400x600/77f035157f33a261b7608dc9cc36fc09a768f385.jpg))**\n\n&gt; However, in election years since 1950, Augusts\u2019 rankings improve: #6 DJIA, #5 S&amp;P 500, #1 NASDAQ (since 1971), #1 Russell 1000 and #1 Russell 2000 (since 1979). This year, the market\u2019s performance in August will likely depend heavily on how July closes and whether or not the rate of covid-19 infection continues to accelerate which could force some areas to roll back reopenings.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August\u2019s First Trading Day Bearish Last 23 Years\n\n&gt; From the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 (page 88), it is known that the first trading days of each month combined gain nearly as much as all other days combined. However, the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2020 Almanac. In the past 23 years DJIA has risen just 30.4% (up 7, down 16) of the time on the first trading day of August. Average and median losses are on the mild side due to a few sizable advances. Over the past nine years, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have both declined nine times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8f6234b8e365d9e861563b4d5b2efa5d/42d5f6b50757b324-8c/s500x750/6269fe4480533724c565c9852bf543a4c59ea172.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Stronger Underneath the Surface\n\n&gt; Earlier today we posted a chart showing S&amp;P 500 sector performance since the Nasdaq's recent peak on 7/20 when Technology stocks began what has now been a 10-day period of consolidation. Below we have updated these performance numbers to include today's moves. While not as many sectors remain in positive territory, the majority of sectors continue to outperform the S&amp;P 500, while Technology drags the market lower. Along with Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary are the only other sectors that have lagged the S&amp;P 500, and their performance has been dragged down by the mega-cap tech-like stocks of Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Expanding on this theme of underlying strength in the index, the chart below shows the average performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 grouped by sector. On an equal-weighted basis, the S&amp;P 500 is actually up 1.3% since 7/20, and only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen negative average returns. On the upside, Real Estate (4.1%) has been the big winner followed by Consumer Discretionary (3.3%), and Consumer Staples (2.2%). The fact that Consumer Discretionary at the cap-weighted sector level is down over 1.4% while the average performance of stocks in the sector has been a gain of 3.3% illustrates what a mammoth impact AMZN has on that sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Breadth among S&amp;P 500 stocks has also been overwhelmingly positive. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, 59% of stocks in the index have had positive returns since the close on 7/20. Only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen fewer than half of their components post positive returns over that time, while Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Utilities have seen roughly three-quarters of their components rally since 7/20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Percent-Up1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far\n\n&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**\n\n&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/eps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # China Running Away YTD\n\n&gt; Every Wednesday, we publish our Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high-level summary of market and economic data of some of the world's largest economies. Of the 23 stock markets tracked, just six including the US are positive year to date at the moment (in local currency). In the chart below we show the YTD performance of these six countries as well as the global median in 2020. As shown, even though it was actually the first to tip into the green YTD following the global sell-off in February and March very briefly back in early June, the US is up the least of this group with a YTD gain of 0.4%. China's stock market is up the most at +14%. Taiwan, South Korea, South Africa, and Malaysia are also outperforming the US but are up more modestly than China with the best of these, Taiwan, gaining 4.53% this year. Meanwhile, the median country in our Global Macro Dashboard remains down 6.2% YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-GMD-ytd.png))**\n\n&gt; Given it is up the most on a year to date basis, China has also gained the largest share of global equity market cap in 2020. As shown in the table below, China has gained 1.7 percentage points of global market cap in 2020 and now takes up 10.14%. China now joins the US as the only other country with a double-digit share of total world market cap. Despite this, China has actually lost share since the bear market lows on 3/23. Meanwhile, the US, Germany, Canada, India, South Korea, and Australia have all gained a significant share since 3/23.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-Mkt-Cap-World.png))**\n\n&gt; # Do the Top 5 Stocks Pose a Risk to the Market?\n\n&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. These five stocks have helped spawn a number of acronyms as they try to capture the rise of mega-cap tech stocks that have led the market higher for much of the past decade. The average return for those five stocks so far this year has been a gain of more than 30%, while the broad S&amp;P 500 Index is just marginally positive, at 0.4% through July 30.\n\n&gt; While many other areas of the market have remained largely static, the total market value of these stocks has dramatically increased, making them an increasingly large piece of market cap-weighted indexes such as the S&amp;P 500. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the combined weight of the top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 has increased to its highest level ever, at nearly 22%. Only one of those five stocks (Microsoft) was a top five name in the index during the previous peak of March 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But does this pose a risk to the index? From a diversification standpoint, one could certainly argue it does. For instance, if any shared risks should come up, from regulation, for example, it could do outsized damage to cap-weighted indexes. However, we believe that the recent gains have been justified by the fundamentals, and we continue to favor both large caps over small caps, and growth-style stocks over value stocks. According to analysis from Credit Suisse, over the past 12 months, the top five stocks in the index have grown revenues at 11.2% vs. just 0.8% for the rest of the S&amp;P 500. Further, the remainder of the S&amp;P 500 has subtracted roughly $17 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS), while the top five stocks have added more than $12.\n\n&gt; Finally, while these stocks have been the face of the recent \u201cstay-at-home trend\u201d and may be more insulated from broader economic weakness, they are far from the only stocks making money this year. On July 30, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index hit a new all-time high and is now up more than 15% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; \u201cAfter a huge run, many of these top stocks may be due for a pause,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, looking out over the next 6 to 12 months, we believe that investors will continue to place a premium on companies that are able to organically grow sales, especially in a low-growth environment.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

# Clorox Co. $236.51\n&gt; **Clorox Co. (CLX)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 6:30 AM ET on Monday, August 3, 2020. The consensus earnings estimate is $2.00 per share on revenue of $1.83 billion and the Earnings Whisper \u00ae number is $2.06 per share. Investor sentiment going into the company's earnings release has 78% expecting an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are for year-over-year earnings growth of 6.38% with revenue increasing by 12.48%.

    "*Introduction*\n\nI'm 20 years old and my interest for the stock market began at age 16 which later grew into becoming my lovely addiction and before graduating high school i already had a detailed plan on how i would become financial independent and self employed as quick as possible, the first milestone to reach before continuing my dreams are to reach an entire net worth of $100 000 dollars.\n\nIn the beginning of setting the $100 000 dollar goal i started with $13 953 dollars and today 1,5 years later i have a total net worth of $66 544 dollars which basically means i only have 33,45% left of the goal to complete within 18 months which is entirely possible. It felt so much harder in the beginning but hard work pays off. While creating the plan i expected to have $52 730 dollars this month of the year but from making better decisions, working hard and presumably a little touch of luck i'm 5 months ahead.\n\nI maximized the overtime-limit at my workplace last year which is roughly 200 hours per year, i managed to reach 212h, sadly the overtime is cancelled due to covid-19 but currently i have 24h 36m in overtime. I've driven taxi *(illegally which i stopped doing)*, been cutting lawns an lending out money in order to speed up the process of my journey.\n\nI've cut almost all unnecessary expenses, i don't travel, i rarely drink alcohol, still driving around in my $1 000 dollar car watching others laugh at me but don't get me wrong, i enjoy traveling and eventfully i'm going to buy myself a new car, i don't want to create wealth just to stare at it. This is something i been planning for a very long time and that i'm fully committed to. It's psychologically frustrating but in the end it's definitely going to be worth it.\n\n*Portfolio distribution*\n\n* *Stocks: 35,79% ($23 816)*\n* *Funds: 8,27% ($5 503)*\n* *Ready assets:* 55,93% ($37 218)\n* *Stocks:* ATVI, AAPL, **AZN**, BAC, **CAST**, DAL, MSFT, **HUFV A**, **KIND SDB**, NFLX, NVDA, **SWED A**, UBER\n* *Funds:* **Avanza Auto 6, Avanza USA, Spiltan Aktiefond Investmentbolag**\n\nnote: *The Tickers with bold fonts are swedish stocks/funds which may not be available in your country.*\n\nI sold a majority of my shares in the beginning of 2020 expecting a recession or correction but instead we got covid-19 which was extremely unpredictable so i was really lucky that i already had a pretty high amount in liquidity. So far i've been taking advantage of the pandemic by investing in stocks that i hopefully believe will recover. I also did some Q1 report trading which made me about $3 000 dollars profit, i traded CAST, GOOG, TWTR and I'm constantly looking for opportunities.\n\nI'm expected to be fully invested within 1 year and i'm not stressed by having 55,93% liquidity since the inflation is 0. The *\"fear of missing out\"* is also nothing that's bothering me, everything can happen, especially now.\n\n*Income, expenses &amp; conditions*\n\nMy monthly income varies depending on how much i work but i averaged $3 008 dollars after taxes during 2019, i invest everything except $500 dollars and the reason how i can invest 83,37% of my monthly income is because i still live at home. The only reason why i still live at home is so i can take advantage of the opportunity to invest and build myself a foundation.\n\n*The Missing piece*\n\nWhat i'm missing is friends and connections with this interest in common, i rarely have anyone to talk with when it comes to investments and such so i really hope that i can reach out to some of you.

      "selftext": "*Introduction*\n\nI'm 20 years old and my interest for the stock market began at age 16 which later grew into becoming my lovely addiction and before graduating high school i already had a detailed plan on how i would become financial independent and self employed as quick as possible, the first milestone to reach before continuing my dreams are to reach an entire net worth of $100 000 dollars.\n\nIn the beginning of setting the $100 000 dollar goal i started with $13 953 dollars and today 1,5 years later i have a total net worth of $66 544 dollars which basically means i only have 33,45% left of the goal to complete within 18 months which is entirely possible. It felt so much harder in the beginning but hard work pays off. While creating the plan i expected to have $52 730 dollars this month of the year but from making better decisions, working hard and presumably a little touch of luck i'm 5 months ahead.\n\nI maximized the overtime-limit at my workplace last year which is roughly 200 hours per year, i managed to reach 212h, sadly the overtime is cancelled due to covid-19 but currently i have 24h 36m in overtime. I've driven taxi *(illegally which i stopped doing)*, been cutting lawns an lending out money in order to speed up the process of my journey.\n\nI've cut almost all unnecessary expenses, i don't travel, i rarely drink alcohol, still driving around in my $1 000 dollar car watching others laugh at me but don't get me wrong, i enjoy traveling and eventfully i'm going to buy myself a new car, i don't want to create wealth just to stare at it. This is something i been planning for a very long time and that i'm fully committed to. It's psychologically frustrating but in the end it's definitely going to be worth it.\n\n*Portfolio distribution*\n\n* *Stocks: 35,79% ($23 816)*\n* *Funds: 8,27% ($5 503)*\n* *Ready assets:* 55,93% ($37 218)\n* *Stocks:* ATVI, AAPL, **AZN**, BAC, **CAST**, DAL, MSFT, **HUFV A**, **KIND SDB**, NFLX, NVDA, **SWED A**, UBER\n* *Funds:* **Avanza Auto 6, Avanza USA, Spiltan Aktiefond Investmentbolag**\n\nnote: *The Tickers with bold fonts are swedish stocks/funds which may not be available in your country.*\n\nI sold a majority of my shares in the beginning of 2020 expecting a recession or correction but instead we got covid-19 which was extremely unpredictable so i was really lucky that i already had a pretty high amount in liquidity. So far i've been taking advantage of the pandemic by investing in stocks that i hopefully believe will recover. I also did some Q1 report trading which made me about $3 000 dollars profit, i traded CAST, GOOG, TWTR and I'm constantly looking for opportunities.\n\nI'm expected to be fully invested within 1 year and i'm not stressed by having 55,93% liquidity since the inflation is 0. The *\"fear of missing out\"* is also nothing that's bothering me, everything can happen, especially now.\n\n*Income, expenses &amp; conditions*\n\nMy monthly income varies depending on how much i work but i averaged $3 008 dollars after taxes during 2019, i invest everything except $500 dollars and the reason how i can invest 83,37% of my monthly income is because i still live at home.

    "I started investing in March after seeing what an opportunity it might be to invest some of the money I have saved. I have read about the importance of diversification and DCA'ing, and over the last few months have been contributing a healthy amount to whats grown into a 38 stock portfolio. I really have no desire to keep tabs on all of these and would much rather contribute to a low expense index fund(s). But I guess I'm afraid of having future FOMO by selling my current positions and potentially lose out on any massive gains an index fund might not yield me. For one reason or another I see most of my positions as relatively \"safe\" and not a bunch of penny meme stocks. \n\nI don't really know what to do and I'm looking for some advice. Should I stop contributing to this portfolio and \"let it ride\", and put all future monies into a new portfolio with only index funds? Do I sell-off everything for a modest profit and reinvest everything into indexes? Or, should I continue to add to this little by little while also opening a separate portfolio for indexes? \n\nI'm not looking to touch this money for a few years (lets say 5-10). I have separate accounts for retirement. \n\nThanks for any insight you can give me! \n\n\nPositions:\n38\nCost basis:\n$18,995.63\nValue:\n$20,522.81\nUnrealized gain:\n+$1,527.18 (\u25b28.04%)\nName\nShares\nAvg. price\nCost basis\nValue\n\nUnrealized gain\n\n\u2605\nTSLA\nTesla, Inc.\n2.10749\n$853.22\n$1,798.15\n$2,127.20\n+$329.05 (\u25b218.30%)\n\n\n\u2605\nAAPL\nApple\n5.86847\n$321.02\n$1,883.91\n$2,123.10\n+$239.19 (\u25b212.70%)\n\n\n\u2605\nAMZN\nAmazon\n0.78101\n$2,474.50\n$1,932.61\n$2,093.40\n+$160.79 (\u25b28.32%)\n\n\n\u2605\nMSFT\nMicrosoft\n10.53849\n$184.64\n$1,945.87\n$2,091.26\n+$145.39 (\u25b27.47%)\n\n\n\u2605\nGOOG\nAlphabet\n1.41422\n$1,408.19\n$1,991.49\n$1,972.79\n-$18.70 (\u25bc0.94%)\n\n\n\u2605\nDIS\nDisney\n11.19432\n$115.06\n$1,288.02\n$1,248.39\n-$39.63 (\u25bc3.08%)\n\n\n\u2605\nDKNG\nDraftKings, Inc.\n36.49025\n$34.58\n$1,261.78\n$1,223.88\n-$37.90 (\u25bc3.00%)\n\n\n\u2605\nFB\nFacebook\n5.19982\n$220.19\n$1,144.97\n$1,147.29\n+$2.32 (\u25b20.20%)\n\n\n\u2605\nPENN\nPenn National Gaming, Inc.\n10.0918\n$14.19\n$143.19\n$300.53\n+$157.34 (\u25b2109.88%)\n\n\n\u2605\nNVDA\nNVIDIA\n0.7489\n$288.69\n$216.20\n$275.60\n+$59.40 (\u25b227.47%)\n\n\n\u2605\nHD\nThe Home Depot, Inc.\n1.06038\n$188.61\n$200.00\n$260.98\n+$60.98 (\u25b230.49%)\n\n\n\u2605\nV\nVisa\n1.30929\n$164.68\n$215.61\n$250.57\n+$34.96 (\u25b216.21%)\n\n\n\u2605\nATVI\nActivision Blizzard, Inc.\n3.26533\n$65.95\n$215.34\n$246.53\n+$31.19 (\u25b214.48%)\n\n\n\u2605\nMMM\n3M Co.\n1.50647\n$132.76\n$200.00\n$234.36\n+$34.36 (\u25b217.18%)\n\n\n\u2605\nSHOP\nShopify, Inc.\n0.25345\n$686.96\n$174.11\n$233.79\n+$59.68 (\u25b234.28%)\n\n\n\u2605\nSQ\nSquare, Inc.\n2.24589\n$74.26\n$166.78\n$232.85\n+$66.07 (\u25b239.62%)\n\n\n\u2605\nTGT\nTarget Corp.\n1.94304\n$110.14\n$214.01\n$230.39\n+$16.38 (\u25b27.65%)\n\n\n\u2605\nSBUX\nStarbucks Corp.\n2.96076\n$67.55\n$200.00\n$217.56\n+$17.56 (\u25b28.78%)\n\n\n\u2605\nJPM\nJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\n2.29989\n$93.37\n$214.74\n$213.89\n-$0.85 (\u25bc0.40%)\n\n\n\u2605\nZM\nZoom Video Communications, Inc.\n0.85841\n$172.81\n$148.34\n$213.37\n+$65.03 (\u25b243.84%)\n\n\n\u2605\nBA\nBoeing\n1.09311\n$154.18\n$168.54\n$212.60\n+$44.06 (\u25b226.14%)\n\n\n\u2605\nLMT\nLockheed Martin Corp.\n0.57761\n$346.25\n$200.00\n$212.27\n+$12.27 (\u25b26.14%)\n\n\n\u2605\nPOOL\nPool Corp.\n0.78839\n$197.30\n$155.55\n$209.55\n+$54.00 (\u25b234.72%)\n\n\n\u2605\nNFLX\nNetflix\n0.46797\n$430.69\n$201.55\n$209.29\n+$7.74 (\u25b23.84%)\n\n\n\u2605\nT\nAT&amp;T\n6.96454\n$29.58\n$206.03\n$208.31\n+$2.28 (\u25b21.11%)\n\n\n\u2605\nSWK\nStanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc.\n1.52037\n$112.41\n$170.91\n$206.95\n+$36.04 (\u25b221.09%)\n\n\n\u2605\nCOST\nCostco Wholesale Corp.\n0.68529\n$313.40\n$214.77\n$206.68\n-$8.09 (\u25bc3.77%)\n\n\n\u2605\nBRK.B\nBerkshire Hathaway, Inc.\n1.14973\n$188.04\n$216.20\n$203.72\n-$12.48 (\u25bc5.77%)\n\n\n\u2605\nWMT\nWalmart, Inc.\n1.70423\n$130.07\n$221.67\n$202.91\n-$18.76 (\u25bc8.46%)\n\n\n\u2605\nKO\nCoca-Cola\n4.53413\n$47.37\n$214.76\n$201.13\n-$13.63 (\u25bc6.35%)\n\n\n\u2605\nWM\nWaste Management, Inc.\n1.91789\n$101.09\n$193.88\n$198.62\n+$4.74 (\u25b22.44%)\n\n\n\u2605\nDAL\nDelta Air Lines, Inc.\n6.81597\n$28.24\n$192.50\n$195.00\n+$2.50 (\u25b21.30%)\n\n\n\u2605\nBAM\nBrookfield Asset Management, Inc.\n5.94179\n$34.65\n$205.88\n$193.88\n-$12.00 (\u25bc5.83%)\n\n\n\u2605\nO\nRealty Income Corp.\n3.23115\n$52.50\n$169.64\n$193.16\n+$23.52 (\u25b213.86%)\n\n\n\u2605\nAMD\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n3.77172\n$57.01\n$215.01\n$189.64\n-$25.37 (\u25bc11.80%)\n\n\n\u2605\nCCL\nCarnival Corp.\n11.00711\n$15.99\n$175.98\n$184.70\n+$8.72 (\u25b24.96%)\n\n\n\u2605\nMGM\nMGM Resorts International\n10.84598\n$14.35\n$155.68\n$182.43\n+$26.75 (\u25b217.18%)\n\n\n\u2605\nTWTR\nTwitter, Inc.\n5.90856\n$27.41\n$161.96\n$174.24\n+$12.28 (\u25b27.58%)",

I have separate accounts for retirement. \n\nThanks for any insight you can give me! \n\n\nPositions:\n38\nCost basis:\n$18,995.63\nValue:\n$20,522.81\nUnrealized gain:\n+$1,527.18 (\u25b28.04%)\nName\nShares\nAvg. price\nCost basis\nValue\n\nUnrealized gain\n\n\u2605\nTSLA\nTesla, Inc.\n2.10749\n$853.22\n$1,798.15\n$2,127.20\n+$329.05 (\u25b218.30%)\n\n\n\u2605\nAAPL\nApple\n5.86847\n$321.02\n$1,883.91\n$2,123.10\n+$239.19 (\u25b212.70%)\n\n\n\u2605\nAMZN\nAmazon\n0.78101\n$2,474.50\n$1,932.61\n$2,093.40\n+$160.79 (\u25b28.32%)\n\n\n\u2605\nMSFT\nMicrosoft\n10.53849\n$184.64\n$1,945.87\n$2,091.26\n+$145.39 (\u25b27.47%)\n\n\n\u2605\nGOOG\nAlphabet\n1.41422\n$1,408.19\n$1,991.49\n$1,972.79\n-$18.70 (\u25bc0.94%)\n\n\n\u2605\nDIS\nDisney\n11.19432\n$115.06\n$1,288.02\n$1,248.39\n-$39.63 (\u25bc3.08%)\n\n\n\u2605\nDKNG\nDraftKings, Inc.\n36.49025\n$34.58\n$1,261.78\n$1,223.88\n-$37.90 (\u25bc3.00%)\n\n\n\u2605\nFB\nFacebook\n5.19982\n$220.19\n$1,144.97\n$1,147.29\n+$2.32 (\u25b20.20%)\n\n\n\u2605\nPENN\nPenn National Gaming, Inc.\n10.0918\n$14.19\n$143.19\n$300.53\n+$157.34 (\u25b2109.88%)\n\n\n\u2605\nNVDA\nNVIDIA\n0.7489\n$288.69\n$216.20\n$275.60\n+$59.40 (\u25b227.47%)\n\n\n\u2605\nHD\nThe Home Depot, Inc.\n1.06038\n$188.61\n$200.00\n$260.98\n+$60.98 (\u25b230.49%)\n\n\n\u2605\nV\nVisa\n1.30929\n$164.68\n$215.61\n$250.57\n+$34.96 (\u25b216.21%)\n\n\n\u2605\nATVI\nActivision Blizzard, Inc.\n3.26533\n$65.95\n$215.34\n$246.53\n+$31.19 (\u25b214.48%)\n\n\n\u2605\nMMM\n3M Co.\n1.50647\n$132.76\n$200.00\n$234.36\n+$34.36 (\u25b217.18%)\n\n\n\u2605\nSHOP\nShopify, Inc.\n0.25345\n$686.96\n$174.11\n$233.79\n+$59.68 (\u25b234.28%)\n\n\n\u2605\nSQ\nSquare, Inc.\n2.24589\n$74.26\n$166.78\n$232.85\n+$66.07 (\u25b239.62%)\n\n\n\u2605\nTGT\nTarget Corp.\n1.94304\n$110.14\n$214.01\n$230.39\n+$16.38 (\u25b27.65%)\n\n\n\u2605\nSBUX\nStarbucks Corp.\n2.96076\n$67.55\n$200.00\n$217.56\n+$17.56 (\u25b28.78%)\n\n\n\u2605\nJPM\nJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\n2.29989\n$93.37\n$214.74\n$213.89\n-$0.85 (\u25bc0.40%)\n\n\n\u2605\nZM\nZoom Video Communications, Inc.\n0.85841\n$172.81\n$148.34\n$213.37\n+$65.03 (\u25b243.84%)\n\n\n\u2605\nBA\nBoeing\n1.09311\n$154.18\n$168.54\n$212.60\n+$44.06 (\u25b226.14%)\n\n\n\u2605\nLMT\nLockheed Martin Corp.\n0.57761\n$346.25\n$200.00\n$212.27\n+$12.27 (\u25b26.14%)\n\n\n\u2605\nPOOL\nPool Corp.\n0.78839\n$197.30\n$155.55\n$209.55\n+$54.00 (\u25b234.72%)\n\n\n\u2605\nNFLX\nNetflix\n0.46797\n$430.69\n$201.55\n$209.29\n+$7.74 (\u25b23.84%)\n\n\n\u2605\nT\nAT&amp;T\n6.96454\n$29.58\n$206.03\n$208.31\n+$2.28 (\u25b21.11%)\n\n\n\u2605\nSWK\nStanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc.\n1.52037\n$112.41\n$170.91\n$206.95\n+$36.04 (\u25b221.09%)\n\n\n\u2605\nCOST\nCostco Wholesale Corp.\n0.68529\n$313.40\n$214.77\n$206.68\n-$8.09 (\u25bc3.77%)\n\n\n\u2605\nBRK.B\nBerkshire Hathaway, Inc.\n1.14973\n$188.04\n$216.20\n$203.72\n-$12.48 (\u25bc5.77%)\n\n\n\u2605\nWMT\nWalmart, Inc.\n1.70423\n$130.07\n$221.67\n$202.91\n-$18.76 (\u25bc8.46%)\n\n\n\u2605\nKO\nCoca-Cola\n4.53413\n$47.37\n$214.76\n$201.13\n-$13.63 (\u25bc6.35%)\n\n\n\u2605\nWM\nWaste Management, Inc.\n1.91789\n$101.09\n$193.88\n$198.62\n+$4.74 (\u25b22.44%)\n\n\n\u2605\nDAL\nDelta Air Lines, Inc.\n6.81597\n$28.24\n$192.50\n$195.00\n+$2.50 (\u25b21.30%)\n\n\n\u2605\nBAM\nBrookfield Asset Management, Inc.\n5.94179\n$34.65\n$205.88\n$193.88\n-$12.00 (\u25bc5.83%)\n\n\n\u2605\nO\nRealty Income Corp.\n3.23115\n$52.50\n$169.64\n$193.16\n+$23.52 (\u25b213.86%)\n\n\n\u2605\nAMD\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n3.77172\n$57.01\n$215.01\n$189.64\n-$25.37 (\u25bc11.80%)\n\n\n\u2605\nCCL\nCarnival Corp.\n11.00711\n$15.99\n$175.98\n$184.70\n+$8.72 (\u25b24.96%)\n\n\n\u2605\nMGM\nMGM Resorts International\n10.84598\n$14.35\n$155.68\n$182.43\n+$26.75 (\u25b217.18%)\n\n\n\u2605\nTWTR\nTwitter, Inc.\n5.90856\n$27.41\n$161.96\n$174.24\n+$12.28 (\u25b27.58%)",

SPY sitting inside yesterdays range in between the 200 day moving average and the 50 day moving average, could be setting up for an inside day. Some strong moves recently but trading has been  a bit choppy so I will be focusing mainly on earnings plays and stocks with catalyst, only trading the best setups. Good luck trading\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not holding any positions in any of the stocks listed above.

    " My [Earnings Call Keynotes](https://imgur.com/VAYvBW4) for the week of May 4th to May 8th 2020. \n\nThis week I will be focusing my attention to 3 of my major holding earnings calls. The earnings calls include: \n\n1. The Walt Disney Company ($DIS) - Tuesday May 5th, 4:30 PM EDT\n2. FLIR Systems, Inc ($FLIR) - Wednesday May 6th, 9:00 AM EDT\n3. Turtle Beach Corporation ($HEAR) - Thursday May 7th, 5:00PM EDT\n\nThe summaries below, are the reasons why I am bullish on these companies for the medium to long-term. \n\n**FLIR Systems ($FLIR):**\n\nThe first company I was to discuss is FLIR. FLIR System has been developing thermal imaging systems since 1978 for use in the avionics industry, because using thermal imaging we can see through total darkness, as well as clouds, fog, etc. Now that we know why they were formed let's look at the current markets for FLIRs technology.\n\n1. US Defense: FLIR currently has many contracts with the US Military and has worked with them for many years. FLIR provides thermal scanning solutions which are used for Border Security, Marine Patrol &amp; Coastal, Search &amp; Rescue, Surveillance, as well as detection of explosives or other harmful substances. Working with the US military provides a revenue stream which continues to drive innovation and continuous improvement on their already market leading tech. I have also attached a link in the video description which shows all the recent FLIR contracts. \n\n[http://investors.flir.com/press-releases?items\\_per\\_page=10&amp;page=0](http://investors.flir.com/press-releases?items_per_page=10&amp;page=0)\n\n1. Autonomous Driving: FLIR has contracts with Vioneer which supports companies such as General Motors, Volkswagen, Audi, Peugeot, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz in their autonomous driving development. This will provide an opportunity for long term growth around the globe. Their thermal sensors are mainly used for Emergency braking systems which is advantageous over many other types of imaging systems for driving in foggy, or reduced visibility conditions. \n2. Health and Safety: As the current COVID-19 pandemic continues more companies announce the importance of thermal scanning being integrated into protection of the public and their workers. As we know with COVID-19, a common symptom of most viral infections is a fever. Thermal imaging can directly detect viral infections but it is an amazing screen tool which can immediately identify those that are high-risk to others. Airports, hospitals, and public markets are already beginning to adopt this technology, however, the growth is endless. This current pandemic has shown us the need for thermal screening and I believe a system like this will be adopted around the globe over the next couple of years. Amazon, Tyson Foods, Intel,  and Ford are just some of the companies which have already begun to implement thermal screening tech in their facilities. \n\nNow I want to take a minute to discuss the company valuation. Before the COVID-19 Pandemic hit FLIR peaked at a market cap of almost 8B, since the all time high its price per share has dropped nearly 40% to just 42.84 at the time of this analysis. It currently has a forward P/E of 18.31 which is slightly above average but a PEG ratio of 0.97 which is awesome especially as I expect the short-term and long-term growth estimates to accelerate. They currently have a revenue approaching 2B annually with a healthy operating margin of approximately 20%. In terms of the balance sheet, they currently have 1.1B in current assets with only 413MM in current liabilities giving them a Current Ratio over 2.5. This company has an average CAGR of 20% per year over the last 20 years not including the dividend it has paid out for the last 10, and I don\u2019t see that changing any time soon. \n\n**Turtle Beach Corp ($HEAR):**\n\nI\u2019m going to start with the reason why Turtle Beach first came onto my radar. After reading *Everybody Lies* by Seth Stephens-Davidowtiz which focuses on the field of data science, I became intrigued of how I could use it in my investing strategies. Now, of course I know data is important in investing, massive companies will use satellite images looking on Tesla factory parking lots to count the inventory levels, but the difference now was that I had access to real time unbiased data using google trends. During the start of lock-down I started to observe trends happening in the real world and used my online resource to see if I could confirm my hypothesis.\n\nI noticed in my friend group and online that there was a sudden interest in gaming due to an increased amount of people being quarantined at home. Now, I knew gaming companies were an obvious beneficiary during the pandemic but what game was everyone playing? Call of Duty Warzone was released on March 10th, 2020 which was almost perfect timing having over 30 million players in under 2 weeks. Call of Duty Warzone was created by Activision Blizzard ($ATVI) but it was a free game, and ATVI was already a $40 billion company so how much could that actually impact the share price in the long-term. Now in first person battle royale games such as Warzone, directional sound is very important to having success in the game. So obviously we can target gaming headset companies. What are the most popular headsets? Astro, Logitech, Turtle Beach are just a couple of the brands of headsets out there but realistically the best way to get direct exposure to such a niche market is through Turtle Beach. Now this was all a hypothesis, let's look at what the data shows.(PS: this is the trend from today, although I originally purchased on March 30th when I was doing these activities)\n\n[Figure 1: Google Trends Relative Search Volume (5 years); xbox headset (blue), gaming headset (red), turtle beach headset (red)](https://imgur.com/a/sWzsUIb) \n\nWe can obviously see this data is quite cyclical with a double peak which occurs the last week of November and the third/fourth week of December every calendar year for obvious reasons. Now we can obviously see there has been a substantial demand in late March and throughout all of April in 2020, peaking higher than the holiday quarter for the first time as far back as the data is available (2004). Can we compare this increased demand to anything else we have seen? If you look closely you can see the slight uptick in demand in Jan/Feb 2018, that was when fortnite went mainstream and peaked in the gaming world. Fortnite is a battle royale game, similar to Warzone in its play-style. How did Turtle Beach ($HEAR) perform during that time? \n\n[Figure 2: Turtle Beach Share Price Q1 and Q2 2018](https://imgur.com/JqxYEwI) \n\nAfter a surprise revenue and eps beat in Q1 of 2018 the share price of Turtle Beach went to a share price of over $30 from a recent low of under $2. Now it is important to notice that the company struggled to maintain this value for the shareholders over time, but the balance sheet was in a much worse position at that time. \n\nSince 2018 the Turtle Beach management team has significantly improved their balance sheet including reducing the debt/equity ratio. They have created strategic partnerships and acquisitions allowing them to gain market share in fast growing areas. As well, they have been able to diversify into PC Gaming instead of purely console. \n\nThe current global demand is great for Turtle Beach in the short to medium-term, as well, the new Xbox and PlayStation is scheduled to be released in Q4 of 2020. With my confidence increasing in the management team I believe this company has a ton of upside potential in the next 3-6 months, possibly longer. This is not a play you can just invest in and leave for 20 years though, you must monitor the environment for the gaming industry, pay close attention to the status of the brand among the community, and keep a close eye on the execution of the management team. \n\n**Disney ($DIS):**\n\n\\*Sorry, it's getting late and I do not have time to write my full analysis for Disney however my keynotes are basically what I want to pay attention to on the conference call. Disney has a history of making great investments, and brand loyalty. Of course the parks are a massive liability given the status of the pandemic however I believe people will come back shortly after the pandemic has subsided. Disney+ service is experiencing growth like no other streaming service has seen before, and most of the content is recycled. They currently offer an extremely low price but have plenty of room to adjust this moving forward. \n\n**Disclosure:** Anyways, I am very bullish on FLIR and Disney in the long-term and have recently added to my positions. I have recently purchased Turtle Beach, and am holding for up-to 6 months but will continue to monitor the business environment. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I am not a financial planner, nor financial analyst. Do your own due diligence before purchasing any equities, the discussion above is purely my opinion. \n\nThanks for reading. I just put this together quickly as I wanted it out well before the Disney Earnings call. I hope this was helpful in some way, please feel free to provide any feedback. Good luck to all, stay safe!",

      "selftext": " My [Earnings Call Keynotes](https://imgur.com/VAYvBW4) for the week of May 4th to May 8th 2020. \n\nThis week I will be focusing my attention to 3 of my major holding earnings calls. The earnings calls include: \n\n1. The Walt Disney Company ($DIS) - Tuesday May 5th, 4:30 PM EDT\n2. FLIR Systems, Inc ($FLIR) - Wednesday May 6th, 9:00 AM EDT\n3. Turtle Beach Corporation ($HEAR) - Thursday May 7th, 5:00PM EDT\n\nThe summaries below, are the reasons why I am bullish on these companies for the medium to long-term. \n\n**FLIR Systems ($FLIR):**\n\nThe first company I was to discuss is FLIR. FLIR System has been developing thermal imaging systems since 1978 for use in the avionics industry, because using thermal imaging we can see through total darkness, as well as clouds, fog, etc. Now that we know why they were formed let's look at the current markets for FLIRs technology.\n\n1. US Defense: FLIR currently has many contracts with the US Military and has worked with them for many years. FLIR provides thermal scanning solutions which are used for Border Security, Marine Patrol &amp; Coastal, Search &amp; Rescue, Surveillance, as well as detection of explosives or other harmful substances. Working with the US military provides a revenue stream which continues to drive innovation and continuous improvement on their already market leading tech. I have also attached a link in the video description which shows all the recent FLIR contracts. \n\n[http://investors.flir.com/press-releases?items\\_per\\_page=10&amp;page=0](http://investors.flir.com/press-releases?items_per_page=10&amp;page=0)\n\n1. Autonomous Driving: FLIR has contracts with Vioneer which supports companies such as General Motors, Volkswagen, Audi, Peugeot, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz in their autonomous driving development. This will provide an opportunity for long term growth around the globe. Their thermal sensors are mainly used for Emergency braking systems which is advantageous over many other types of imaging systems for driving in foggy, or reduced visibility conditions. \n2. Health and Safety: As the current COVID-19 pandemic continues more companies announce the importance of thermal scanning being integrated into protection of the public and their workers. As we know with COVID-19, a common symptom of most viral infections is a fever. Thermal imaging can directly detect viral infections but it is an amazing screen tool which can immediately identify those that are high-risk to others. Airports, hospitals, and public markets are already beginning to adopt this technology, however, the growth is endless. This current pandemic has shown us the need for thermal screening and I believe a system like this will be adopted around the globe over the next couple of years. Amazon, Tyson Foods, Intel,  and Ford are just some of the companies which have already begun to implement thermal screening tech in their facilities. \n\nNow I want to take a minute to discuss the company valuation. Before the COVID-19 Pandemic hit FLIR peaked at a market cap of almost 8B, since the all time high its price per share has dropped nearly 40% to just 42.84 at the time of this analysis. It currently has a forward P/E of 18.31 which is slightly above average but a PEG ratio of 0.97 which is awesome especially as I expect the short-term and long-term growth estimates to accelerate. They currently have a revenue approaching 2B annually with a healthy operating margin of approximately 20%. In terms of the balance sheet, they currently have 1.1B in current assets with only 413MM in current liabilities giving them a Current Ratio over 2.5. This company has an average CAGR of 20% per year over the last 20 years not including the dividend it has paid out for the last 10, and I don\u2019t see that changing any time soon. \n\n**Turtle Beach Corp ($HEAR):**\n\nI\u2019m going to start with the reason why Turtle Beach first came onto my radar. After reading *Everybody Lies* by Seth Stephens-Davidowtiz which focuses on the field of data science, I became intrigued of how I could use it in my investing strategies. Now, of course I know data is important in investing, massive companies will use satellite images looking on Tesla factory parking lots to count the inventory levels, but the difference now was that I had access to real time unbiased data using google trends. During the start of lock-down I started to observe trends happening in the real world and used my online resource to see if I could confirm my hypothesis.\n\nI noticed in my friend group and online that there was a sudden interest in gaming due to an increased amount of people being quarantined at home. Now, I knew gaming companies were an obvious beneficiary during the pandemic but what game was everyone playing? Call of Duty Warzone was released on March 10th, 2020 which was almost perfect timing having over 30 million players in under 2 weeks. Call of Duty Warzone was created by Activision Blizzard ($ATVI) but it was a free game, and ATVI was already a $40 billion company so how much could that actually impact the share price in the long-term. Now in first person battle royale games such as Warzone, directional sound is very important to having success in the game. So obviously we can target gaming headset companies. What are the most popular headsets? Astro, Logitech, Turtle Beach are just a couple of the brands of headsets out there but realistically the best way to get direct exposure to such a niche market is through Turtle Beach. Now this was all a hypothesis, let's look at what the data shows.(PS: this is the trend from today, although I originally purchased on March 30th when I was doing these activities)\n\n[Figure 1: Google Trends Relative Search Volume (5 years); xbox headset (blue), gaming headset (red), turtle beach headset (red)](https://imgur.com/a/sWzsUIb) \n\nWe can obviously see this data is quite cyclical with a double peak which occurs the last week of November and the third/fourth week of December every calendar year for obvious reasons. Now we can obviously see there has been a substantial demand in late March and throughout all of April in 2020, peaking higher than the holiday quarter for the first time as far back as the data is available (2004). Can we compare this increased demand to anything else we have seen? If you look closely you can see the slight uptick in demand in Jan/Feb 2018, that was when fortnite went mainstream and peaked in the gaming world. Fortnite is a battle royale game, similar to Warzone in its play-style. How did Turtle Beach ($HEAR) perform during that time? \n\n[Figure 2: Turtle Beach Share Price Q1 and Q2 2018](https://imgur.com/JqxYEwI) \n\nAfter a surprise revenue and eps beat in Q1 of 2018 the share price of Turtle Beach went to a share price of over $30 from a recent low of under $2. Now it is important to notice that the company struggled to maintain this value for the shareholders over time, but the balance sheet was in a much worse position at that time. \n\nSince 2018 the Turtle Beach management team has significantly improved their balance sheet including reducing the debt/equity ratio. They have created strategic partnerships and acquisitions allowing them to gain market share in fast growing areas. As well, they have been able to diversify into PC Gaming instead of purely console. \n\nThe current global demand is great for Turtle Beach in the short to medium-term, as well, the new Xbox and PlayStation is scheduled to be released in Q4 of 2020. With my confidence increasing in the management team I believe this company has a ton of upside potential in the next 3-6 months, possibly longer. This is not a play you can just invest in and leave for 20 years though, you must monitor the environment for the gaming industry, pay close attention to the status of the brand among the community, and keep a close eye on the execution of the management team. \n\n**Disney ($DIS):**\n\n\\*Sorry, it's getting late and I do not have time to write my full analysis for Disney however my keynotes are basically what I want to pay attention to on the conference call. Disney has a history of making great investments, and brand loyalty. Of course the parks are a massive liability given the status of the pandemic however I believe people will come back shortly after the pandemic has subsided. Disney+ service is experiencing growth like no other streaming service has seen before, and most of the content is recycled. They currently offer an extremely low price but have plenty of room to adjust this moving forward. \n\n**Disclosure:** Anyways, I am very bullish on FLIR and Disney in the long-term and have recently added to my positions. I have recently purchased Turtle Beach, and am holding for up-to 6 months but will continue to monitor the business environment. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I am not a financial planner, nor financial analyst. Do your own due diligence before purchasing any equities, the discussion above is purely my opinion. \n\nThanks for reading. I just put this together quickly as I wanted it out well before the Disney Earnings call. I hope this was helpful in some way, please feel free to provide any feedback. Good luck to all, stay safe!",

    "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 4th, 2020.\n\n# **April\u2019s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday\u2019s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.\n*****\n&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. \u201cI think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n*****\n&gt; But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. \u201cIf they go well that\u2019s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that\u2019ll be a blow to confidence,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; # Best April in years\nStocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. \u201cNow there\u2019s not that much to look forward to,\u201d he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. \u2026 Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April\u2019s gains.\u201d The S&amp;P 500\u2032s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.\n*****\n&gt; # Virus economy\nEconomists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. \u201cThis is all a stab in the dark,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cBut I do think you\u2019re going to see steady improvement. I think you\u2019re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.\n*****\n&gt; Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.\n*****\n&gt; But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it could spook people,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cIn the markets, we\u2019ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday\u2019s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it\u2019s unclear how quickly it can recover.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are people who will go and do things as soon as they\u2019re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think expecting we\u2019re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.\n*****\n&gt; # A new 20-year bond\nThe Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said.

The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren\u2019t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.\n\n&gt; The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit\u2019s preliminary Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing\u2014the so-called official PMI\u2014provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg\u2019s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But that\u2019s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.\n\n&gt; The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cGiven the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we\u2019ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.\u201d\n\n&gt; The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter\u2014potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&amp;P 500 earnings).\n\n&gt; Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.\n\n*****\n\n# Global Central Banks All In\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd the market is seeing it. It\u2019s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-Chart-20-04-30.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity\n\n&gt; The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 \u2013 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.\n\n&gt; The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.\n\n&gt; The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.\n\n&gt; With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed\u201d alive even in an age of zero rates.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition\n\n&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear \u201cSell in May.\u201d But when exactly in May is the \u201cbest\u201d time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May\u2019s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1df0a9e6bf9c57baf44e6917725a0b23/49574a3950141284-4d/s500x750/4f224d3ee89c6ef6d69c08facbac61a77da3fd3b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# This is Still an Election Year\n\n&gt; We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.\n\n&gt; Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dce5f19dd2ccfc16a4e0795dd5a11f68/8033867962439c40-45/s500x750/8543ffd66d568035ffa681a3d72b861c8f84b996.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.\n\n&gt; Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman\u2019s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe57b47990e4b1b913e16595818a4df4/8033867962439c40-ea/s500x750/b5004568a1ca04f9004d23bd405de22f277408f2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot\n\n&gt; The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two\u2014Utilities and Financials\u2014above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.\n\n&gt; When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.\n\n&gt; The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/10day.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

      "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 4th, 2020.\n\n# **April\u2019s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday\u2019s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.\n*****\n&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. \u201cI think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n*****\n&gt; But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. \u201cIf they go well that\u2019s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that\u2019ll be a blow to confidence,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; # Best April in years\nStocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. \u201cNow there\u2019s not that much to look forward to,\u201d he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. \u2026 Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April\u2019s gains.\u201d The S&amp;P 500\u2032s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.\n*****\n&gt; # Virus economy\nEconomists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. \u201cThis is all a stab in the dark,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cBut I do think you\u2019re going to see steady improvement. I think you\u2019re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.\n*****\n&gt; Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.\n*****\n&gt; But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it could spook people,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cIn the markets, we\u2019ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday\u2019s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it\u2019s unclear how quickly it can recover.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are people who will go and do things as soon as they\u2019re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think expecting we\u2019re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.\n*****\n&gt; # A new 20-year bond\nThe Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe supply announcement we think is significant because you\u2019re going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,\u201d said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lucZqhO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ScMf5ki.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/lTrieA0.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/a6RSgrj.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9mfZglW.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Rkt7Uup.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8Ru9JJy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1L1YEEG.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwM4sys.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OxcbRYQ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zvZWYtm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/93bme56.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/b57XIzN.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession\n\n&gt; It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren\u2019t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.\n\n&gt; The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit\u2019s preliminary Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing\u2014the so-called official PMI\u2014provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg\u2019s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But that\u2019s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.\n\n&gt; The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cGiven the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we\u2019ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.\u201d\n\n&gt; The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter\u2014potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&amp;P 500 earnings).\n\n&gt; Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.\n\n*****\n\n# Global Central Banks All In\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd the market is seeing it. It\u2019s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-Chart-20-04-30.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity\n\n&gt; The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 \u2013 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.\n\n&gt; The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.\n\n&gt; The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.\n\n&gt; With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed\u201d alive even in an age of zero rates.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition\n\n&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear \u201cSell in May.\u201d But when exactly in May is the \u201cbest\u201d time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May\u2019s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1df0a9e6bf9c57baf44e6917725a0b23/49574a3950141284-4d/s500x750/4f224d3ee89c6ef6d69c08facbac61a77da3fd3b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# This is Still an Election Year\n\n&gt; We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.\n\n&gt; Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dce5f19dd2ccfc16a4e0795dd5a11f68/8033867962439c40-45/s500x750/8543ffd66d568035ffa681a3d72b861c8f84b996.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.\n\n&gt; Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman\u2019s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe57b47990e4b1b913e16595818a4df4/8033867962439c40-ea/s500x750/b5004568a1ca04f9004d23bd405de22f277408f2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot\n\n&gt; The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two\u2014Utilities and Financials\u2014above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.\n\n&gt; When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.\n\n&gt; The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/10day.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

    "I am 19 years old and below is a couple companies I think are great buys at this point in time. Open to any opinions. I welcome any other companies that you think are great buys.\n\n\nThe list below is my growth stocks\n\nAMD = This company has established its presence in the processor industry. In the past year, they have reported their best earnings ever. They have a lot more room to grow.\nAAPL = Apple products will keep growing especially with 5G technology in their new phones. They are an extremely popular company and they have done a good job in diversifying their revenues sources. \nBA = Boing is a company that has a very big reputation that has been bashed for lots of errors. Their price is very attractive and I don't think this company is going anywhere, the government has contracted with them and won't let them go under.\nENPH =  Endphase is a renewable energy company based off of solar production. They are relatively new and are already turning a profit. Their financials are solid and I believe the importance of renewable energy will only grow.\nYUM = Yum has is an incredible corporation of fast food companies that are very popular in the US. Their price has taken a big hit and I see solid returns in the long term.\nBYND = Beyond produces food that is environmentally friendly. This trend of eating fake meat is growing and is displayed by fast-food chains selling this fake meat. In a way, this is a renewable energy company because of the meat production industry which is terrible for the environment.\nMAXR = Maxar technologies, in my opinion, is extremely undervalued. They are currently at $10 and was previously at $80. They have reached bottom support, I am not as confident in this company as my other ones on this list.\nTSLA = Tesla exemplifies how clean energy is going to be the next biggest thing. Tesla is expensive but everyone in the world knows what Tesla is because it is groundbreaking. Tesla is powerful because everyone and their mother thinks it is cool.\nAQN = Also a company that engages in energy. They have been minimally affected by the stock market dropping. They have deeply invested in renewable energy and are relatively new. They are turning a profit.\nVSLR = This is a riskier renewable energy stock. They are very new and have a lot to prove. Their price has been destroyed by the drop from $11 to $4.8, they also have very strong buy recommendations from multiple analysts. Big potential for this solar company.\nATVI = Activision is a company that makes very popular video games and has a big influence on young kids. Video games are only growing in popularity. Their balance sheet is incredible and they have been performing well because everyone is playing games and their release of COD.  \nMSFT = Microsoft is a monster of a company and has built a moat between them and their competition. They are well known and very consistent.\nBABA = The Amazon of China only recently added on the US stock market. They have incredible year over year growth and outstanding buy recommendations from over 50 analysts.\n\nETF's\n\nQQQ = A great measure of the market that is more weight on technology than the SPY\nSPY = Can't go wrong with this\nXAR = ETF based on space technology and defense. As technology grows humans will want to explore the possibilities of space more. War is a part of life, so is the money-making part of it.\n\nDividend Growth is below \n\nTGT = Excellent company that is doing a great job transferring onto the internet world.\nABT = Aristocrat legend\nWMT = Same thing as a target. Such a resilient price that the stock market drop has done virtually nothing to them.\nMCD = Who doesn't love a happy meal.\nDIS = Stock price has been absolutely destroyed. This company isn't going anywhere. They have been advancing by creating new movies and streaming services. Kids love Disney Fantasy.",

    "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Tuesday. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, April 7th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-7-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures were pointing to an over 700-point gain at Tuesday\u2019s open a day after President Donald Trump expressed hope about research for treatment of the coronavirus. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 1,600 points, or 7.7%, to start the week as data showed signs of new U.S. cases slowing. However, it\u2019s too early to determine whether that\u2019s a trend. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 7% on Monday. The Nasdaq rose 7.3%, bringing the index out of a bear market. But the Dow and S&amp;P 500 remained in bear market territory \u2014 declines of at least 20% from 52-week highs. All three stock indexes hit all-time highs in February before states issued stay-at-home orders to fight the spread of the virus and the economy ground to a halt.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Trump, at Monday evening\u2019s White House coronavirus briefing, said, \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d The president said 10 therapeutics are in active trials and some are looking \u201cincredibly successful.\u201d Fifteen other potential treatments are \u201cadvancing rapidly\u201d toward clinical trials, he added. Trump also said, \u201cStay inside and let\u2019s win this and let\u2019s get our country [back] as soon as we can. I think it\u2019s going to be sooner than people think. Things are going really well.\u201d However, at the same briefing, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the world may never get back to what it considered \u201cnormal\u201d before the coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China in December.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * A warning in late January from White House trade advisor Peter Navarro about the potential severity of the coronavirus in America came as the president was publicly playing down the risks. According to The New York Times, Navarro wrote in memos that the outbreak could cost the U.S. trillions of dollars and put millions of Americans at risk of infection or death. Navarro is a leading hardliner in trade talks with China. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said another $1 trillion is needed, beyond the just-passed $2.2 trillion effort. The California Democrat wants another round of direct payments to Americans and more money for companies to keep making payroll. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said in recent days that health care should top the list, signaling his intent to get to work on a new bill.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * World leaders are rallying around U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, wishing him a speedy recovery from the coronavirus. On Monday evening, he was admitted to the intensive care unit at St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital in London after his symptoms worsened. Trump sent his best wishes, saying: \u201cAll Americans are praying for him, he\u2019s a friend of mine, he\u2019s a great gentleman and a great leader.\u201d Johnson announced on March 27 that he tested positive for the coronavirus. He was said to be suffering from \u201cmild symptoms,\u201d but he was hospitalized Sunday evening and moved to the ICU a day later. Johnson\u2019s medical team said the prime minister was conscious and not on a ventilator. Johnson had asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to carry on the prime minister\u2019s duties \u201cwhere necessary.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Britain\u2019s over 52,000 coronavirus cases are among the top 10 nations with the most infections, according to Johns Hopkins University data. However, with 5,385 deaths, the U.K.\u2019s mortality rate was over 10%, second only to Italy\u2019s 12.5% death rate.

      "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Tuesday. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, April 7th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-7-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures were pointing to an over 700-point gain at Tuesday\u2019s open a day after President Donald Trump expressed hope about research for treatment of the coronavirus. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 1,600 points, or 7.7%, to start the week as data showed signs of new U.S. cases slowing. However, it\u2019s too early to determine whether that\u2019s a trend. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 7% on Monday. The Nasdaq rose 7.3%, bringing the index out of a bear market. But the Dow and S&amp;P 500 remained in bear market territory \u2014 declines of at least 20% from 52-week highs. All three stock indexes hit all-time highs in February before states issued stay-at-home orders to fight the spread of the virus and the economy ground to a halt.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Trump, at Monday evening\u2019s White House coronavirus briefing, said, \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d The president said 10 therapeutics are in active trials and some are looking \u201cincredibly successful.\u201d Fifteen other potential treatments are \u201cadvancing rapidly\u201d toward clinical trials, he added. Trump also said, \u201cStay inside and let\u2019s win this and let\u2019s get our country [back] as soon as we can. I think it\u2019s going to be sooner than people think. Things are going really well.\u201d However, at the same briefing, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the world may never get back to what it considered \u201cnormal\u201d before the coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China in December.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * A warning in late January from White House trade advisor Peter Navarro about the potential severity of the coronavirus in America came as the president was publicly playing down the risks. According to The New York Times, Navarro wrote in memos that the outbreak could cost the U.S. trillions of dollars and put millions of Americans at risk of infection or death. Navarro is a leading hardliner in trade talks with China. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said another $1 trillion is needed, beyond the just-passed $2.2 trillion effort. The California Democrat wants another round of direct payments to Americans and more money for companies to keep making payroll. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said in recent days that health care should top the list, signaling his intent to get to work on a new bill.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * World leaders are rallying around U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, wishing him a speedy recovery from the coronavirus. On Monday evening, he was admitted to the intensive care unit at St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital in London after his symptoms worsened. Trump sent his best wishes, saying: \u201cAll Americans are praying for him, he\u2019s a friend of mine, he\u2019s a great gentleman and a great leader.\u201d Johnson announced on March 27 that he tested positive for the coronavirus. He was said to be suffering from \u201cmild symptoms,\u201d but he was hospitalized Sunday evening and moved to the ICU a day later. Johnson\u2019s medical team said the prime minister was conscious and not on a ventilator. Johnson had asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to carry on the prime minister\u2019s duties \u201cwhere necessary.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Britain\u2019s over 52,000 coronavirus cases are among the top 10 nations with the most infections, according to Johns Hopkins University data. However, with 5,385 deaths, the U.K.\u2019s mortality rate was over 10%, second only to Italy\u2019s 12.5% death rate.

I've been gambling with SQQQ, TZA, DWT, SPXU, etc, hence all the cash + I luckily pulled out  all my investments very early into this market crash. PUTS on SPY, amiiright? Might be too risky for my blood, personally. I've got about \\~$55K to invest. With so many companies I fancy, and trying to diversify my future portfolio I'm wondering how much to DCA into each company over the next couple months. I'd love feedback.\n\n I've been investing for \\~8 years, mostly doing DCA and not looking at my portfolio for months at a time. Been out of the market for \\~2 years cause buying a house took every penny. Just decided to get back in, in Jan ... almost perfectly timed haha.\n\nWhat companies don't you like? How much would you initially purchase into? Would you cut down on the number of companies to invest into? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: I grabbed prices, ratios, etc at some point over the last couple days, so numbers are a fuzzy\n\n**MSFT, Microsoft** \n\n* It's Microsoft. They are a great company with every lasting appeal to wether this crash and to continue to be a great business in the future. While they are less sexy than their 2 major OS competitors (Apple, Google (Android)), they have such an entrenched position into the business world, I can't see how they would ever fade away at this point. The deal they are making, where their going to carry Linux kernel in Windows, or the deals they are making with their XBOX brand, or talks they Azure is going to really take off cause it's a far better equipped business to partner with. yah MSFT, no brainer. \n* EPS 5.74\n* P/E 25.59\n* Yield 1.38%\n* Peak 52wk price 188.2\n* Discount from 52wk @ price $146.92, -21.93% \n\n**AAPL, Apple** \n\n* It's Apple.

From a US defense perspective, the federal government will probably not allow Boeing to actually go under. They've been beaten so much by the 737 Maxx grounding &amp; the current market crash, they are such a deal. I imagine those lucky souls that grabbed @ $100 a share in 2-5 years will make 3x easily.\n* EPS -\n* P/E -\n* Yield 8.65%\n* Peak 52wk price 398.66\n* Discount from 52wk @ price 158.73, -60.18% \n\n**ULTA, Ulta Beauty**\n\n* This company has great financials.

Again look at that EPS\n* EPS 11.98\n* P/E 10.86\n* Yield 3.61%\n* Peak 52wk price 192.76 \n* Discount from 52wk @ price 133.16, -38.03% \n\n**ENPH, Enphase Energy**\n\n* It'll take a decade, but solar will become a huge part of the energy sector. It's just time.\n* EPS 1.23\n* P/E 26.28\n* Yield -\n* Peak 52wk price 59.15\n* Discount from 52wk @ price 36.13, -38.92% \n\n**SEDG, SolarEdge**\n\n* It'll take a decade, but solar will become a huge part of the energy sector.

Also, I believe they will pivot to alternative energy once it makes sense for them. The oil war has made them so cheap.\n* EPS 3.36\n* P/E 11.1\n* Yield 9.82%\n* Peak 52wk price 83.49\n* Discount from 52wk @ price 37.29, -55.34% \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notable Companies Missing in my view**\n\n* FB, probably should? idk\n* NVDA, They own the GPU market and will probably continue to dominate\n* AMZN, AMZN to $10,000 stonks price!?!?! It's just such an expensive stock\n* NFLX, it's expensive .... I guess\n* TSLA, I will absolutely buy TSLA, it needs to slide down below $400 again. \n* LULU, Their PE is little high, I want to see more a discount\n* HD, they may get hit harder with COVID-19. Wait it out.\n* DEAC, I think they will be huge, draft kings will become huge. \n* AMD, I think we're at a moment where AMD may start to really comp at Intel's lunch in the server market. I'm in tech, in hardware, and I see in our own decisions and others that Intel has really become a mountain that cannot move to please their customers while AMD is busting there ass ... and has more attractive technology in some segments. Stay tuned. \n* PFE, should probably get some pharmaceuticals exposure.\n* DPZ, wow who else missed this boat? Should of been buying them for a while ha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Companies I'm a hard pass on.**\n\n*  I follow video games quiet intensely, and while ATVI made me a lot of money in the past, I think their greed is starting to hamstring their profitability. Folks, are not happy with their current releases. Sure, the disgruntled voices may be the minority, but I see them turning into an EA. Which EA is profitable but ... I'm not sure the outlook is bigger/better\n\nAnyway I appreciate all thoughts, comments, feedback, trolling, hate, love, disinterest. Happy investing in this \ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udcb9!",

It's just such an expensive stock\n* NFLX, it's expensive .... I guess\n* TSLA, I will absolutely buy TSLA, it needs to slide down below $400 again. \n* LULU, Their PE is little high, I want to see more a discount\n* HD, they may get hit harder with COVID-19. Wait it out.\n* DEAC, I think they will be huge, draft kings will become huge. \n* AMD, I think we're at a moment where AMD may start to really comp at Intel's lunch in the server market. I'm in tech, in hardware, and I see in our own decisions and others that Intel has really become a mountain that cannot move to please their customers while AMD is busting there ass ... and has more attractive technology in some segments. Stay tuned. \n* PFE, should probably get some pharmaceuticals exposure.\n* DPZ, wow who else missed this boat? Should of been buying them for a while ha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Companies I'm a hard pass on.**\n\n*  I follow video games quiet intensely, and while ATVI made me a lot of money in the past, I think their greed is starting to hamstring their profitability. Folks, are not happy with their current releases. Sure, the disgruntled voices may be the minority, but I see them turning into an EA. Which EA is profitable but ... I'm not sure the outlook is bigger/better\n\nAnyway I appreciate all thoughts, comments, feedback, trolling, hate, love, disinterest. Happy investing in this \ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udcb9!",

    "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

      "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

    "I am a long term investor. I typically buy and hold forever. I don\u2019t need to cash out right now, and am hoping to retire in 20 years. Like many others, I have some stocks that are up quite a bit over the past few years. I am considering placing Trailing Stop % orders of 10% on some of my bigger winners - AAPL, TWTR, ATVI, FB, PEGI, AMZN, MSFT. I\u2019ve got losers too but I plan to hold on to them - my rationale being that they\u2019ve already dropped since I bought them and I\u2019m hoping they don\u2019t have as much to drop as the stocks that are up. If the end of 2020 comes around and they\u2019re still down, I\u2019ll sell to offset my taxes.\n\nFaulty thinking?  Place stop loss orders on all my stocks?  None of them?\n\nWhat\u2019s your feedback?  I have learned a lot from this sub and am grateful to learn from your collective experiences. I actually only recently learned about stop-loss orders from this sub. \n\nOne hesitation I have is that if I cashed out in November or December 2018, I know I would not have bought back in at the right time and would not be sitting on my current gains. I just have a feeling this time will be worse because global uncertainty is worse today than it was in November / December 2018, IMO. I wasn\u2019t investing during the 2008-2009 storm. \n\nThanks",
