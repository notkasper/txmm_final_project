Or maybe is it from a whale investor? Did the company do something recently to warrant this jump? Is it insider trading? My knowledge of stocks are somewhat limited. I\u2019ve started investing this year around June and already making a 25% profit from investing $7,300. But still, limited experience du to starting this June. Any help would be appreciated!",

    "**US equities mostly higher: Dow +0.13%, S&amp;P 500 +0.16%, Nasdaq +0.10%, Russell 2000 +0.79%**\n\n* US equities mostly higher in Thursday morning trading. Healthcare best performer on strength in dental names, biotech and HMOs. Industrials beating tape on select post-earnings strength in rails. Communications services extending recent outperformance on post-earnings telco strength. Consumer staples a laggard on disappointing earnings out of HPC. REITs also underperforming. Treasuries unchanged to slightly weaker. Dollar firmer on the major crosses after coming under pressure on Wednesday and hitting a seven-week low. Gold down 1.2%. WTI crude up 1.5%.\n* **Stimulus** still the big story. White House and Democrats continued to tout progress, most recently Pelosi this morning. Comes after Trump accusation last night of Democrats blocking a deal. McConnell has suggested vote may not come until after the election which raises new risks. On the **election** front, final debate is tonight, latest polls seem to be telling largely the same story, and top US intelligence official warned Iran and Russia were attempting to influence voters. Somewhat mixed **coronavirus** headlines as rising case counts, hospitalizations and fresh restrictions remain a concern though the two stalled vaccine trials in the US are expected to resume this week. Big improvement in **initial and continuing jobless claims**. **Existing home sales** beat, extending housing market strength.\n* Big day of **earnings**. Beat rates elevated but also coming down a bit from earlier in the week. In addition, bar somewhat higher than during Q2 earnings season given combination of estimate revisions, positive guidance trends and market strength. A number of high-profile themes in focus today, including secular growth, strength in at-home, housing and autos, improving industrial backdrop, weakness in travel, consumer and credit resilience, lingering coronavirus uncertainty, US-China tensions, and cost-cutting. Quiet in terms of corporate news outside of earnings following some M&amp;A activity earlier in the week.\n\n**Notable Gainers:**\n\n* \\+33.3% **ALGN-US** (Align Technology): Big Q3 earnings, revenue, and margin beat; highlighted strong momentum for both Invisalign and iTero scanners; noted marketing drove uptick in consumer engagement and increased comfort with virtual tools.\n* \\+7.9% **LVS-US** (Las Vegas Sands): Q3 consolidated property EBITDA and net revenue not as bad as feared with better results in Las Vegas and Marina Bay; analysts noted improving Singapore trends and positive management commentary on Macau demand.\n* \\+7.8% **DFS-US** (Discover Financial): Q3 EPS, revenue beat; NII, NIM beat, provision better than expected; analysts highlighted better credit performance; increased spending in first half of October in most affected categories, including travel, restaurants, gas.\n* \\+3.3% **AXTA-US** (Axalta Coating Systems): Big Q3 EPS and EBITDA beat; volumes held up much better than expected and improved throughout the Q; implied Q4 guidance above; Street positive on cost control efforts, leverage to auto recovery and qualitative commentary on Q4; also noted elevated expectations following PPG-US results.\n* \\+1.8% **KO-US** (Coca-Cola): Q3 earnings and revenue beat though guidance withheld; analysts noted better at home performance, continued portfolio rationalization and strong liquidity; also relative strength in Coke versus low margin water brands, stronger than expected margins, beats in most regions except for Asia.\n* \\+1.3% **TSLA-US** (Tesla): Q3 beat on key metrics and company maintained 500K unit delivery guidance for 2020 (though said tough to achieve); also hinted that 2021 units could be 800K+; Street particularly positive on automotive gross margin performance and FCF; also the usual discussion about the positive narrative surrounding the company's wide competitive moat; multiple upgrades.\n\n**Notable Decliners:**\n\n* \\-7.5% **TSCO-US** (Tractor Supply): Q3 earnings and revenue beat; comps well ahead of consensus with improvement in both traffic and ticket; however, analysts noted high expectations, elevated valuation, and longer-term EPS growth impacts from investments.\n* \\-6.1% **CMG-US** (Chipotle Mexican Grill): Q3 earnings and comps beat modestly with revenue in line, withheld guidance; analysts noted high expectations and deceleration of current quarter comps, difficult Q4 compare on base effects of carne asada launch last year; though overall good results and continued store additions.\n* \\-5.6% **KMB-US** (Kimberly-Clark): Q3 EPS missed despite higher revenue/organic sales upside; GM missed by 90 bp and brand investment higher; Professional segment the drag as both Personal Care and Consumer Tissue beat on sales and operating profit; raised FY organic sales growth and EPS guidance; cost savings from restructuring expected by end of 2021 but could slip back due to coronavirus.\n* \\-5.4% **EW-US** (Edwards Lifesciences): Q3 earnings and revenue beat though guidance raise disappointed somewhat; analysts noted TAVR market has recovered from Covid-related declines across geographies but some of the gains in Europe due to backlog-clearing; also tougher y/y comps and potential for regional Covid disruptions going forward.\n* \\-4.5% **UNP-US** (Union Pacific): Q3 EPS a bit light, revenue in line; OR improved to record level, boosted by lower fuel costs, though missed estimates; revenue per carload also weaker; analysts positive on direction of most operating metrics, though disappointed by OR, strategic outlook without COO Vena.\n* \\-2.1% **RS-US** (Reliance Steel): Q3 earnings beat but revenue weaker; noted improved pricing and higher tons sold; Q4 EPS guidance below the Street; cautiously optimistic on non-residential construction but sees declining sales in certain markets (such as aerospace).\n* \\-1.4% **LRCX-US** (Lam Research): Fiscal Q1 revenue and EPS ahead; GM better on customer and product mix and utilization; Dec Q guidance above despite SMIC headwind; however, GM guidance light; reiterated 2020 WFE outlook; takeaways mostly positive with focus on continued strength in Foundry and NAND but some concern about pull-in and China risks.\n\n09:20:44 AM CDT on 22 Oct '20",

    "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 21, 2020**\n\nStocks traded choppily today as market participants closely monitor development in Washington surrounding stimulus. Though Pelosi\u2019s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is \u201coptimistic\u201d about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.\n\nDespite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell\u2019s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump\u2019s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.\n\nIn other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans\u2019 attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in \u201call-or-nothing obstruction\u201d as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she \u201chas a prospect for an agreement\u201d with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. \u201cThere will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent \u2014 my goal \u2014 or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.\u201d It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Snapchat (SNAP) rocketed up today after posting better than expected quarterly earnings report. The Stock was up 30.88% at the time of writing. Other social media stocks (FB, TWTR, an notably PINS) were up in sympathy\n   * EPS of $0.01 vs -$0.04 expected\n   * Revenue of  $678.7 million vs. $547.2 million expected\n* United Airlines (UAL) will on Wednesday test a digital health pass as part of a global pilot program designed to accelerate a safer opening of international borders and kick-start global travel. Under this system, travelers will have taken a COVID-19 test up to 72 hours before traveling, and logged the results from a certified laboratory on the CommonPass app on their phones.     \n* Purdue Pharmaceutical, the maker of opioid painkiller OxyContin, plead guilty to three federal criminal charges for its role in creating the nation's opioid crisis and will pay more than $8 billion and close down the company. The money will go to opioid treatment and abatement programs. DEA Assistant Administrator Tim McDermott said, \u201cPurdue Pharma actively thwarted the US\u2019 efforts to ensure compliance and prevent diversions. The devastating ripple effect of Purdue\u2019s actions left lives lost and others addicted.\u201d This is one of the most significant blows dealt by the US government against the opioid epidemic. \n* Nokia (NOK) and Greener Acres Canada disclosed on Wednesday an agreement to upgrade Canada's utility pole infrastructure to smart, eco-friendly poles across the country.\n* Renewable energy giant Iberdrola, through its U.S. subsidiary Avangrid, will acquire PNM Resources (PNM) which is New Mexico\u2019s largest utility.

      "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 21, 2020**\n\nStocks traded choppily today as market participants closely monitor development in Washington surrounding stimulus. Though Pelosi\u2019s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is \u201coptimistic\u201d about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.\n\nDespite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell\u2019s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump\u2019s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.\n\nIn other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans\u2019 attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in \u201call-or-nothing obstruction\u201d as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she \u201chas a prospect for an agreement\u201d with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. \u201cThere will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent \u2014 my goal \u2014 or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.\u201d It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Snapchat (SNAP) rocketed up today after posting better than expected quarterly earnings report. The Stock was up 30.88% at the time of writing. Other social media stocks (FB, TWTR, an notably PINS) were up in sympathy\n   * EPS of $0.01 vs -$0.04 expected\n   * Revenue of  $678.7 million vs. $547.2 million expected\n* United Airlines (UAL) will on Wednesday test a digital health pass as part of a global pilot program designed to accelerate a safer opening of international borders and kick-start global travel. Under this system, travelers will have taken a COVID-19 test up to 72 hours before traveling, and logged the results from a certified laboratory on the CommonPass app on their phones.     \n* Purdue Pharmaceutical, the maker of opioid painkiller OxyContin, plead guilty to three federal criminal charges for its role in creating the nation's opioid crisis and will pay more than $8 billion and close down the company. The money will go to opioid treatment and abatement programs. DEA Assistant Administrator Tim McDermott said, \u201cPurdue Pharma actively thwarted the US\u2019 efforts to ensure compliance and prevent diversions. The devastating ripple effect of Purdue\u2019s actions left lives lost and others addicted.\u201d This is one of the most significant blows dealt by the US government against the opioid epidemic. \n* Nokia (NOK) and Greener Acres Canada disclosed on Wednesday an agreement to upgrade Canada's utility pole infrastructure to smart, eco-friendly poles across the country.\n* Renewable energy giant Iberdrola, through its U.S. subsidiary Avangrid, will acquire PNM Resources (PNM) which is New Mexico\u2019s largest utility.
