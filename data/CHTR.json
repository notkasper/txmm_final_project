Companies leveraged to at-home trends (work, learn, watch, eat) have reported some of the best results. Cloud, auto and housing exposure have provided a tailwind while Q3 has also seen a rebound in digital ad spending. Travel, cross-border and urban exposure have remained big headwinds. Post-earnings price action has been influenced a number of factors, including a high bar/expectations, sustainability and more macro-leaning influences such as worsening coronavirus trends and election uncertainty.\n\n**Fed focus likely to shift to asset purchase composition:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-turns-attention-to-asset-purchases-after-spelling-out-low-rate-pledges-11604226601) previewed this week's Fed meeting. Noted while Fed not expected to announce any changes, it could review plans to provide additional support. Most obvious move for the Fed would be to shift the composition of asset purchases toward longer-dated Treasuries. Pointed out that the Fed is buying $120B a month of Treasury and MBS, more than the $85B pace at which it purchased assets in QE3 between 2012 and 2014. However, while QE3 was focused on long-term securities, Fed is currently buying equal amounts of short-, medium- and long-term debt. However, article also discussed thoughts that shifting the composition of purchases may not do much at this point given long-term yields are already depressed. Perceived lack of urgency to adjust QE program played into some concerns about \"peak Fed\" coming out of the September FOMC meeting.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 894871, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Top Market News - Monday, Nov. 2, 2020", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jmw7pz/top_market_news_monday_nov_2_2020/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1604347606.0}], [[], false, "InterestingNews1", null, [], null, "text", "t2_uipg9", false, false, [], false, false, 1603539490, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jh7hb9/some_interesting_news_in_the_stock_market_this/", {}, "jh7hb9", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 1, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/jh7hb9/some_interesting_news_in_the_stock_market_this/", false, 6, 1603539501, 1, "On **Monday** Shelby Tucker from RBC Capital maintained a buy rating on FirstEnergy $FE with a TP of $37 and follows a similar move by Morgan Stanley on October 5th with a TP of $39.\n\nThat allows 20% upside and looks reasonable given the stock was valued at $42 in July and $52 in February.\n\nThose valuations were before the Ohio Consumer Council asked the state's Public Utilities Commission to conduct an independent investigation of FirstEnergy, which federal authorities have tied to a $60M bribery scheme involving Ohio's former House Speaker.

The pandemic has clearly had a huge impact on the company. However, recently Booking has witnessed a recovery in its business. Newly booked room nights have steadily improved, from 15% of their normal level in April to 65% of their normal level in July.\n\nThe company has reinforced their liquidity with $10.5 billion of cash compared to $11.5 billion of debt and cash flow is almost neutral (usually +$5 billion). Consequently the company appears surefooted.\n\nThe valuation meanwhile is still down 20% from 2018 highs and trading on just 18x last years earnings. That looks cheap with strong balance sheet and the expected rebound in demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSemiconductor test equipment maker Teradyne $TER saw its shares surge 4.7% on **Wednesday** after the company delivered better-than-expected third-quarter results and guidance;\n\n* earnings rose 53% while sales climbed 41%\n* Q4 guidance is for an adjusted EPS $0.98 on sales of $710 million.

It also makes industrial automation equipment (9%), including collaborative and mobile robots.\n\nThe medium term outlook for testing is strong with the widespread roll out of 5G and suppressed demand expected to be released from Auto and Industry. Chief Executive Mark Jagiela said \"Entering Q4, market conditions in our test businesses are stronger than expected and we've positioned our production capacity to respond to potential short lead time demands as we move through the quarter.\"\n\nThe trailing PE of 23.55 looks attractive given the expected medium term outperformance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn **Thursday** Align jumped 35% after reporting knock out earnings as the CEO credited the \u201cZoom effect\u201d for making people more aware of their crooked smiles.

Specifically he discussed the company's approach to transforming mental healthcare, using psilocybin, the active ingredient in psychedelic, or \"magic\" mushrooms.\n\nThe company is currently in Phase 2b of its clinical trials, where the efficacy of the treatment is tested. Goldsmith also noted that the treatment has received breakthrough therapy designation from the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA), allowing it to expedite the development and review of the therapy. \n\nIn addition to the U.S., the UK-based company is doing clinical trials in eight other countries. The company expects to complete and report on its Phase 2b trials at the end of 2021, Goldsmith said in the interview. \n\nCompass initially plans to use its psilocybin therapy for patients with treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, addiction and other mental illnesses. The treatment combines the use of the psychoactive substance with trained therapist psychological support.\n\nWith 3.4 million sufferers, we get a $4 billion total addressable market if we assume 15% penetration and $8,000 cost.  Compass\u2019 $1.3 billion market cap looks cheap in comparison.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, my favorite story this week.  On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne maintained a Hold rating on Liberty Broadband $LBRDK and set a price target of $174.00. That\u2019s below the analyst consensus of a Moderate Buy with an average price target of $183.33 but enough above the current $140 to make it interesting.\n\nLiberty Broadband was created in September 2014 when Liberty Media spun off its cable businesses into a new unit. It was a typically complex arrangement by to avoid tax liabilities but the important part is that LBRDK ended up holding a 25% stake in Charter Communications $CHTR. Then, in May 2016, Charter acquired both Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, quadrupling the number of customers and becoming the second-largest cable company in the US after Comcast.\n\nCharter is now trading at around $592, so Liberty\u2019s original investment is worth $35 billion. That is interesting because LBRDK\u2019s other assets and liabilities are fairly trivial and the $35 billion asset offers a striking premium to the current market cap of $25 billion.\n\nImportantly there are a couple of catalysts here that should drive these two values together. The Liberty group is taking steps to simplify its structure with the merger of GCI Liberty and Liberty Broadband. That will reduce some overhead costs and allow cross shareholdings to be collapsed in a tax efficient manner. Secondly, LBRDK announced an expansion of its buyback program from $200 million to $1.2billion, citing the widening discount to NAV.\n\nThese measures may not be enough by themselves to drive these two values together but show that management is now addressing the issue. In the meantime shareholders get to hold a stake in Charter at a discount. Not bad given the $CHTR stock has performed well  (up 20% over 12 months) and could well have further to run. Cable is still one of the dominant / most efficient broadband technologies today and CHTR's management team is regarded as one of the most experienced teams in the cable industry. Additionally, the impact of COVID has been immaterial and the stock is up 10% since February.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cFollow\u201d me to get updates and links during the week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.
