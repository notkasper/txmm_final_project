I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 7th, 2020.\n\n# **Any progress on stimulus could give the market a boost in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/stimulus-hope-markets-focus-next-week.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stimulus to help the economy and vaccines to stop the virus are expected to the be the main focus in markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Efforts to move along a fiscal package in Congress picked up momentum in the past week with Congressional leaders sounding conciliatory, and a bi-partisan group of senators pushing their own $900 billion proposal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt probably boils down to how much [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is willing to deal, and I don\u2019t know what the answer is to that,\u201d said Mike Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to happen, next week is the week. The government runs out of money on Friday. Congress has to come up with a funding scheme.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists have said the two events could be tied, but Congress could also push through a spending resolution without including stimulus. Some programs will expire at the end of the month, if Congress does not provide funding, including unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.\n*****\n&gt; The on again, off again stimulus talks have led to skepticism in the market, and sets it up for a move higher if there is anything officially announced. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s fully baked in. I would say the stimulus is a positive catalyst, unless it\u2019s less than $900 billion,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.\n*****\n&gt; While stocks surged in the past week, bond yields also moved higher. Yields move opposite price, and bond yields have been rising on stimulus expectations. More spending means more debt, and that sends rates higher.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year was at 0.97% Friday, and appeared ready to move back to the 1% level for the first time since March.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIs it the case here, stimulus is already factored in, and will people take their money and run?\u201d said Schumacher.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.7% in the past week, ending Friday at 3,699, a record high. The Dow also ended up 1% at a record 30,218, and Nasdaq gained 2.1% to a record 12,464.\n*****\n&gt; # Getting jabbed\n&gt; Vaccine news has been a catalyst for the market\u2019s surge since early November, when Pfizer first revealed the high efficacy of its vaccine. Since then Moderna and Astra-Zeneca both revealed results of their own vaccines.\n*****\n&gt; A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meets Thursday on emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey\u2019re starting to roll it out in the U.K, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be watched here to see how it unfolds,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist Prudential Financial. \u201cThat\u2019s the next issue for the market. The deliveries, the distributions. Are people being jabbed? These are all questions the market is concerned about about because they\u2019re looking forward to it unrolling smoothly in the U.S.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 3 million people will be vaccinated in the initial rollout. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is expected to be approved the following week, and by year-end both vaccines are expected to reach 20 million people in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe vaccine news has started to see a bit of diminishing return in terms of its wow factor,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some volatility around the logistics.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the virus remains in the forefront for the market because of the continuing spread and its economic impact as activities are shut down. California Thursday announced new restrictions with stay at home advisories in some regions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe big question is how long does the Covid surge last?\u201d Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; The virus shutdowns appear to be behind a slowdown in the labor market, and economists say it could slow activity into the first quarter. November job growth of 245,000 was about 200,000 less than expected. That makes Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims more important for markets.\n*****\n&gt; There is also CPI and PPI inflation data Thursday and Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is this push pull in the market regarding inflationary pressures,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cIt\u2019s not expected, which is why if it does print higher, it could ignite the conversation regarding inflation.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PZEBIS8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ypJI3Vy.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/s01kzjN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/7Y1RKiX.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nF9LHWm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/F99YkSI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/00G6LqZ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8OK0Nmw.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tgMnGUY.png))**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PDrxDY8.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5rCf9oe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VsZzlKU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/moiEQsJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Bonds Both in Rally Mode\n\n&gt; When it comes to equity market performance in a given month, it doesn't get much better than November. While the S&amp;P 500's total return of 10.95% in the month was only the second-best monthly performance of the year, it was still enough to rank as the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500 in the last thirty years and just the ninth month since 1980 that it was up 10%+.\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500's annualized total return over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares the current returns to the historical average. For the last year, the S&amp;P 500's total return has been 17.5% which is nearly six full percentage points higher than the historical average. For the last two years, the annualized return has been nearly as strong at 16.8%, and it is actually even stronger relative to the historical average of 10.5%. Moving further out the time horizon, the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns drift lower, and while the five and ten-year annualized returns are greater than average, the S&amp;P 500's annualized gain of 7.3% in the last 20 years is more than 3.5 percentage points below the historical average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-SP-500-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; The last couple of years haven't just been strong for equities. Over the last year, long-term US Treasuries, as measured by the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index, have rallied 15.7%, which is more than six full percentage points greater than the historical average of 9.5%. Over the last two years, returns have been even stronger with an annualized gain of nearly 20%, or more than double the historical average of 9.1%! While the last two years have been strong for US Treasuries, the last five, ten, and twenty years have all seen returns of between one and two percentage points below their historical average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120LT-Treas-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Lately, when you see rallies in the equity market, it tends to be accompanied by a decline in treasuries as yields rise. In November, though, that wasn't the case. Even with the S&amp;P 500 up 10.95%, long-term US Treasuries rallied just over 1%. So how uncommon is it for stocks to rally like they did in November while bonds also rally. Actually, it is not very uncommon at all. The table below shows the nine months since 1980 where the S&amp;P 500's total return in a given month was 10% or more, and of those months, long-term treasuies also rallied in every month but one (October 2011).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-Stocks-Up-10.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Manufacturer Recovery Continues\n\n&gt; This morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a less positive outlook for the US manufacturing sector. The headline number for ISM's Manufacturing index fell from 59.3 last month down to 57.5. A drop was expected, but the actual results were worse than the drop to 58.0 that had been forecasted. That reading indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow in November but at a slower rate than October.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Similar to the various Federal Reserve bank surveys from around the country, breadth in the November report was more negative than in recent months. Of the ten indices excluding the headline number, only three were higher in November: Backlog Orders, Supplier Deliveries, and Export Orders. Additionally, two indices\u2014Customer Inventories and Employment\u2014showed contractionary readings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Table1.png))**\n\n&gt; One theme of the report was that orders remain very healthy. New Orders fell from 67.9 to 65.1, but that is a sixth consecutive month of expansionary readings. Although the index was lower this month, meaning new order growth decelerated, it remains in the top decile of historical readings. As new orders have continued to grow, so too have backlogs. The index for Backlog Orders has continued to press higher, rising to 56.9 from 55.7. That is in the 88th percentile of all months and is now at the highest level since August of 2018. Demand continues to improve with new orders coming in at a historically strong pace, even though it is slower than last month, and order backlogs have once again risen as a result.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Orders.png))**\n\n&gt; As new order growth decelerated, so too did production. The index fell from 63.0 in October to 60.8 last month. That is still consistent with growth (readings above 50) in production but at the slowest rate since June. One factor that potentially had an impact on the slowdown in production is issues with suppliers. The index for Supplier Deliveries rose for the fourth month in a row in November and reached the highest level since May. Higher readings in the Supplier Deliveries index indicates longer lead times and vice versa. In other words, products from suppliers have been taking longer to reach manufacturers, in turn, impacting productivity.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Prod-Supp.png))**\n\n&gt; Although suppliers appear to have some constraints and production has slowed slightly, business inventories rose for the second month in a row even as more and more firms report that customer inventories are too low. The index for Customer Inventories now sits in the bottom 2% of historical readings after dropping another 0.4 points in November. At 36.3, the index is at the lowest level since June of 2010. That low reading can be considered positive for future production.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Inventorie.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Gains In November Steal From Santa\n\n&gt; What a month November was! Here are some of the highlights:\n\n&gt; * Best month for Dow since January 1987 (11.9%) and best November since 1928\n&gt; * Best month ever for the STOXX 600 (16.7%)\n&gt; * Best month ever for the Russell 2000 (18.3%)\n&gt; * Best month for the S&amp;P 500 (10.8%) and Nasdaq (11.8%) since April 2020\n&gt; * Best month for Dow Transports since October 2011 (12.1%)\n&gt; * Best month from PHLX Semiconductor Index since March 2003 (18.4%)\n&gt; * Best month for Industrials (16.0%) and Financials (16.8%) since April 2009\n&gt; * Second best month ever for energy (28.0%)\n\n&gt; A way better than expected earnings season, a likely split Congress, and major breakthroughs on the vaccine front all helped stocks soar last month,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAdd ongoing support from the Federal Reserve as the cherry on top and we are looking at a truly historic month on many levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s all the Dow monthly returns since 1900. Last month was the best return since January 1987. Now before you go out and sell because you see 1987, remember the S&amp;P 500 added another 20% the seven months after the huge gains in early 1987.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It was the best November for the S&amp;P 500 since November 1928.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Small caps soared on the likelihood of taxes staying lower due to a divided Congress and vaccine progress, with the Russell 2000 adding more than 18% for the best month ever, topping the previous record from February 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What happens after a big month? Well, history says a 10% monthly gain is quite bullish. In fact, we had a 10% plus rally back in April 2020 and shared this same chart at that time. Sure enough, returns have been strong this time around as well. \u201cThe bottom line is the huge gains in November could actually be the start of something much stronger,\u201d according to Ryan Detrick. \u201cAlso, this was the second month of 2020 with a 10% gain. The only other year to do that? 1982, which kicked off a historic bull market.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Turning to December, this month is widely known to be quite bullish, as Santa comes to town, people feel good, and stocks tend to do well. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year, with only November better. December had been the best month of the year until the historic 9.2% drop in 2018. As a result, December hasn\u2019t been quite as strong over the past 10 and 20 years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking it down even more, a big rally in November can potentially steal some of December\u2019s thunder. As after a 5% or 10% rally in November, the returns in December are more muted. The flipside to this though is if the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 10% for the year (like 2020), then stocks have benefited from some performance chasing and have tended to do better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What does it all mean? After the historic move in November we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see below average returns in December. We do believe this is a new bull market and lasting economic cycle of growth, but overall sentiment is getting quite stretched and this increases the potential for some near-term weakness.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 7th, 2020.\n\n# **Any progress on stimulus could give the market a boost in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/stimulus-hope-markets-focus-next-week.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stimulus to help the economy and vaccines to stop the virus are expected to the be the main focus in markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Efforts to move along a fiscal package in Congress picked up momentum in the past week with Congressional leaders sounding conciliatory, and a bi-partisan group of senators pushing their own $900 billion proposal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt probably boils down to how much [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is willing to deal, and I don\u2019t know what the answer is to that,\u201d said Mike Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to happen, next week is the week. The government runs out of money on Friday. Congress has to come up with a funding scheme.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists have said the two events could be tied, but Congress could also push through a spending resolution without including stimulus. Some programs will expire at the end of the month, if Congress does not provide funding, including unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.\n*****\n&gt; The on again, off again stimulus talks have led to skepticism in the market, and sets it up for a move higher if there is anything officially announced. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s fully baked in. I would say the stimulus is a positive catalyst, unless it\u2019s less than $900 billion,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.\n*****\n&gt; While stocks surged in the past week, bond yields also moved higher. Yields move opposite price, and bond yields have been rising on stimulus expectations. More spending means more debt, and that sends rates higher.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year was at 0.97% Friday, and appeared ready to move back to the 1% level for the first time since March.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIs it the case here, stimulus is already factored in, and will people take their money and run?\u201d said Schumacher.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.7% in the past week, ending Friday at 3,699, a record high. The Dow also ended up 1% at a record 30,218, and Nasdaq gained 2.1% to a record 12,464.\n*****\n&gt; # Getting jabbed\n&gt; Vaccine news has been a catalyst for the market\u2019s surge since early November, when Pfizer first revealed the high efficacy of its vaccine. Since then Moderna and Astra-Zeneca both revealed results of their own vaccines.\n*****\n&gt; A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meets Thursday on emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey\u2019re starting to roll it out in the U.K, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be watched here to see how it unfolds,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist Prudential Financial. \u201cThat\u2019s the next issue for the market. The deliveries, the distributions. Are people being jabbed? These are all questions the market is concerned about about because they\u2019re looking forward to it unrolling smoothly in the U.S.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 3 million people will be vaccinated in the initial rollout. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is expected to be approved the following week, and by year-end both vaccines are expected to reach 20 million people in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe vaccine news has started to see a bit of diminishing return in terms of its wow factor,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some volatility around the logistics.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the virus remains in the forefront for the market because of the continuing spread and its economic impact as activities are shut down. California Thursday announced new restrictions with stay at home advisories in some regions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe big question is how long does the Covid surge last?\u201d Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; The virus shutdowns appear to be behind a slowdown in the labor market, and economists say it could slow activity into the first quarter. November job growth of 245,000 was about 200,000 less than expected. That makes Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims more important for markets.\n*****\n&gt; There is also CPI and PPI inflation data Thursday and Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is this push pull in the market regarding inflationary pressures,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cIt\u2019s not expected, which is why if it does print higher, it could ignite the conversation regarding inflation.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PZEBIS8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ypJI3Vy.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/s01kzjN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/7Y1RKiX.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nF9LHWm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/F99YkSI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/00G6LqZ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8OK0Nmw.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tgMnGUY.png))**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PDrxDY8.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5rCf9oe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VsZzlKU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/moiEQsJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Bonds Both in Rally Mode\n\n&gt; When it comes to equity market performance in a given month, it doesn't get much better than November. While the S&amp;P 500's total return of 10.95% in the month was only the second-best monthly performance of the year, it was still enough to rank as the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500 in the last thirty years and just the ninth month since 1980 that it was up 10%+.\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500's annualized total return over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares the current returns to the historical average. For the last year, the S&amp;P 500's total return has been 17.5% which is nearly six full percentage points higher than the historical average. For the last two years, the annualized return has been nearly as strong at 16.8%, and it is actually even stronger relative to the historical average of 10.5%. Moving further out the time horizon, the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns drift lower, and while the five and ten-year annualized returns are greater than average, the S&amp;P 500's annualized gain of 7.3% in the last 20 years is more than 3.5 percentage points below the historical average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-SP-500-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; The last couple of years haven't just been strong for equities. Over the last year, long-term US Treasuries, as measured by the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index, have rallied 15.7%, which is more than six full percentage points greater than the historical average of 9.5%. Over the last two years, returns have been even stronger with an annualized gain of nearly 20%, or more than double the historical average of 9.1%! While the last two years have been strong for US Treasuries, the last five, ten, and twenty years have all seen returns of between one and two percentage points below their historical average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120LT-Treas-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Lately, when you see rallies in the equity market, it tends to be accompanied by a decline in treasuries as yields rise. In November, though, that wasn't the case. Even with the S&amp;P 500 up 10.95%, long-term US Treasuries rallied just over 1%. So how uncommon is it for stocks to rally like they did in November while bonds also rally. Actually, it is not very uncommon at all. The table below shows the nine months since 1980 where the S&amp;P 500's total return in a given month was 10% or more, and of those months, long-term treasuies also rallied in every month but one (October 2011).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-Stocks-Up-10.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Manufacturer Recovery Continues\n\n&gt; This morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a less positive outlook for the US manufacturing sector. The headline number for ISM's Manufacturing index fell from 59.3 last month down to 57.5. A drop was expected, but the actual results were worse than the drop to 58.0 that had been forecasted. That reading indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow in November but at a slower rate than October.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Similar to the various Federal Reserve bank surveys from around the country, breadth in the November report was more negative than in recent months. Of the ten indices excluding the headline number, only three were higher in November: Backlog Orders, Supplier Deliveries, and Export Orders. Additionally, two indices\u2014Customer Inventories and Employment\u2014showed contractionary readings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Table1.png))**\n\n&gt; One theme of the report was that orders remain very healthy. New Orders fell from 67.9 to 65.1, but that is a sixth consecutive month of expansionary readings. Although the index was lower this month, meaning new order growth decelerated, it remains in the top decile of historical readings. As new orders have continued to grow, so too have backlogs. The index for Backlog Orders has continued to press higher, rising to 56.9 from 55.7. That is in the 88th percentile of all months and is now at the highest level since August of 2018. Demand continues to improve with new orders coming in at a historically strong pace, even though it is slower than last month, and order backlogs have once again risen as a result.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Orders.png))**\n\n&gt; As new order growth decelerated, so too did production. The index fell from 63.0 in October to 60.8 last month. That is still consistent with growth (readings above 50) in production but at the slowest rate since June. One factor that potentially had an impact on the slowdown in production is issues with suppliers. The index for Supplier Deliveries rose for the fourth month in a row in November and reached the highest level since May. Higher readings in the Supplier Deliveries index indicates longer lead times and vice versa. In other words, products from suppliers have been taking longer to reach manufacturers, in turn, impacting productivity.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Prod-Supp.png))**\n\n&gt; Although suppliers appear to have some constraints and production has slowed slightly, business inventories rose for the second month in a row even as more and more firms report that customer inventories are too low. The index for Customer Inventories now sits in the bottom 2% of historical readings after dropping another 0.4 points in November. At 36.3, the index is at the lowest level since June of 2010. That low reading can be considered positive for future production.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Inventorie.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Gains In November Steal From Santa\n\n&gt; What a month November was! Here are some of the highlights:\n\n&gt; * Best month for Dow since January 1987 (11.9%) and best November since 1928\n&gt; * Best month ever for the STOXX 600 (16.7%)\n&gt; * Best month ever for the Russell 2000 (18.3%)\n&gt; * Best month for the S&amp;P 500 (10.8%) and Nasdaq (11.8%) since April 2020\n&gt; * Best month for Dow Transports since October 2011 (12.1%)\n&gt; * Best month from PHLX Semiconductor Index since March 2003 (18.4%)\n&gt; * Best month for Industrials (16.0%) and Financials (16.8%) since April 2009\n&gt; * Second best month ever for energy (28.0%)\n\n&gt; A way better than expected earnings season, a likely split Congress, and major breakthroughs on the vaccine front all helped stocks soar last month,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAdd ongoing support from the Federal Reserve as the cherry on top and we are looking at a truly historic month on many levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s all the Dow monthly returns since 1900. Last month was the best return since January 1987. Now before you go out and sell because you see 1987, remember the S&amp;P 500 added another 20% the seven months after the huge gains in early 1987.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It was the best November for the S&amp;P 500 since November 1928.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Small caps soared on the likelihood of taxes staying lower due to a divided Congress and vaccine progress, with the Russell 2000 adding more than 18% for the best month ever, topping the previous record from February 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What happens after a big month? Well, history says a 10% monthly gain is quite bullish. In fact, we had a 10% plus rally back in April 2020 and shared this same chart at that time. Sure enough, returns have been strong this time around as well. \u201cThe bottom line is the huge gains in November could actually be the start of something much stronger,\u201d according to Ryan Detrick. \u201cAlso, this was the second month of 2020 with a 10% gain. The only other year to do that? 1982, which kicked off a historic bull market.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Turning to December, this month is widely known to be quite bullish, as Santa comes to town, people feel good, and stocks tend to do well. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year, with only November better. December had been the best month of the year until the historic 9.2% drop in 2018. As a result, December hasn\u2019t been quite as strong over the past 10 and 20 years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking it down even more, a big rally in November can potentially steal some of December\u2019s thunder. As after a 5% or 10% rally in November, the returns in December are more muted. The flipside to this though is if the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 10% for the year (like 2020), then stocks have benefited from some performance chasing and have tended to do better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What does it all mean? After the historic move in November we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see below average returns in December. We do believe this is a new bull market and lasting economic cycle of growth, but overall sentiment is getting quite stretched and this increases the potential for some near-term weakness.

This thing was already known, when they published the candidate data in November, they also [announced](https://ibb.co/cDtdMCy) this number, but people runed away way to fast before going more into the data. Pfizer did not cut supply, they just explained why this happened in this latest headline. It is way better for companies to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around.\n\nThe [VIX](https://ibb.co/HYrVJNH) also saw a spike around the Pfizer news and finished higher for the day while 59% of companies were advancing with almost 150 new highs and just 3 new lows on below average volume of 11,5 billion shares compared to 11,7 billion shares in the last 20 trading days.

At the moment the company still only has a small market cap but I plan to own this for the long-term(5+years) as I expect great things from them.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 31st, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks head into September in high gear as Apple and Tesla split, and markets await the August jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/28/stocks-start-september-in-high-gear-as-apple-and-tesla-split-and-markets-await-the-august-jobs-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; September is historically challenging for the market, but stocks could start the month on an upswing after what looks to be the best August for the S&amp;P 500 in at least 34 years.\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead will be busy with Fed speakers and economic reports, including the important August employment count Friday. Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida speaks at 9 a.m. ET Monday on monetary policy. He is is one of several officials, who are expected to reiterate Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole message that the Fed would be willing to let inflation run hot temporarily to help the economy and job market.\n*****\n&gt; The low volume days of late summer should be a hallmark of the week ahead, but there could also be window dressing trades around the month\u2019s end, as investors rebalance holdings.\n*****\n&gt; On Monday, there could be some excitement around two of the market\u2019s favorite stocks. Apple begins trading after a 4-for-1 split. Tesla is also trading on a split-adjusted basis starting Monday, after it split its stock 5-for-1. Apple\u2019s split changes its weight in the Dow, so the index is being adjusted and there will be new names in the index Monday as some old ones leave. ExxonMobil, Pfizer and Raytheon will be replaced by Salesforce.com, Amgen and Honeywell.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.2% in the past week, and it could continue to make gains in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we\u2019re still going to be basking in the the glow of an accommodative Fed, combined with the increased accessibility of Apple\u2019s share price to retail investors,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said that after its last split in 2014, Apple gained 36% over the next year, but after its 2000 split as the tech bubble burst, it lost 60%. Apple has risen more than 30% since announcing its stock split on July 30.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was on track for a more than 6.9% gain in August, its best performance since 1986 if it holds that level through Monday. The S&amp;P recovered and surpassed its all time high during the month and is now flirting with the psychological 3,500 area.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has on average lost 0.5% in September, its worst month of the year going back to World War II, Stovall said. When the S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 5% in August, September gained an average 1.4% and was positive in four of the seven years also back to the 1940s, Stovall said.\n*****\n&gt; # Jobs, jobs, jobs\n&gt; Economists are slightly more optimistic about the economic data in the third quarter, but the job market has been an area of concern with unemployment claims still running around 1 million a week. According to Refinitiv, economists expect 1.4 million jobs were created in August, down from 1.76 million in July. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 9.8% from 10.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m assuming we just continue the momentum we saw in the prior month,\u201d said Aneta Markowska, Jefferies chief economist. Markowska said the monthly number has been difficult to forecast because the lack of correlation with unemployment claims, typically a strong barometer for monthly payrolls data but not as much since the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen really in the last two to three months is a sharp snapback in the hiring in the sectors that were most depressed in Covid. You have restaurant workers, leisure workers coming back,\u201d Markowska said. \u201cAt the same time, you\u2019re seeing a much smaller wave of layoffs in other industries. There was a second order knock-on affect, as a result of profit weakness and companies trying to cut costs as a result of that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said there\u2019s been a debate in the market for the last several weeks about whether jobs gains are beginning to flatline.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt strikes me that if you get a better-than-expected number that probably sends risk assets flying, but a somewhat worse-than-expected number would have less impact,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Schumacher said the market may pay some attention to so far floundering efforts in Washington for a new stimulus package. But he added the market has been ignoring the issue for now, as Congress appears to be getting further apart.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe are worried about the impact on these small businesses if there\u2019s no bridge for the next six months,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed message\n&gt; After Powell spoke at the Jackson Hole symposium Thursday, Treasury yields moved in a wide range. The 10-year note was as low as 0.65% and as high as 0.78% Friday, before settling in at about 0.74% in afternoon trading Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Powell said the Fed would be willing to let inflation rise a bit above 2% for awhile, and that it would now target an average without moving to tighten policy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market reaction to Powell was a little confusing. I suspect the Fed did not want to see this back-up in nominal yields and I suspect they\u2019ll push against it,\u201d said Markowska.\n*****\n&gt; Fed watchers said the message from Powell was that the Fed will likely keep rates lower for a longer period. Bond strategists said the market was responding to the idea of higher inflation, and rates were rising, particularly at the long end of the curve.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TLHe03j.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TfUKyzr.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/4yWqZND.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/LXBYRb7C/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oQ3yHrS.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VD6IBme.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YaBzNQp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/f3VmrXB.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/RFx6btHt/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/3xk18bTX/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/VNGzq6TQ/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/d1hw4FP7/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/Dzy24sxP/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Stocks: Worlds Apart\n\n&gt; If you've been paying attention this year, you know that the S&amp;P 500 has been carried by the performance of the index's largest components, and the chart below illustrates just how wide the disparity has been. It shows the YTD performance of each of the S&amp;P 500's members sorted by their market cap heading into 2020 with the largest stocks on the left side and the smallest stocks on the right. So far this year, the 50 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.3% YTD, and if we were to take an even narrower look at just the ten largest stocks heading into the year, the average YTD gain is over 27%!\n\n&gt; While the largest stocks are up a lot this year, the next 400 stocks in terms of market cap haven't fared nearly as well, averaging a decline of 2.0%. That's not great, but considering the pandemic this year, even a 2% decline isn't such a bad thing. The same can't be said for the smallest stocks in the S&amp;P, however. As shown below, the 50 smallest stocks are down an average of 15.3% YTD, and more than two-thirds of them are down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/0827-Individual-stocks.png))**\n\n&gt; Another way to illustrate the declining fortunes of stocks this year based on their size is by looking at a moving average of YTD stock performance across the market cap spectrum, In the chart below, the first point on the chart represents the performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 which have gained an average of 11.3% YTD. The next point to the right represents the average YTD change of the stocks that ranked between number 2 and 51 in terms of market cap at the start of 2020, and we continue that process down the entire list of components to the point where the last point in the series on the right side of the chart represents the average performance of the 50 smallest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 heading into the year. As mentioned above, that group of stocks has averaged a decline of 15.3% YTD. The performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 ranks as the fourth-best of 451 different points on the chart, while the basket of the 50 smallest stocks ranks as the 29th worst performing basket. In 2020, the bigger the stock, the better the returns.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/0827moving-average-YTD-performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Which Bull Will It Be?\n\n&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 bear market bottom continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 50% from those fateful lows. It feels like a lifetime since the longest bull market ever ended. Remember though, although the recent bull market was the longest, it wasn\u2019t the greatest, as the 1990s bull gained more on a percentage basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We discussed in detail what the new highs in the S&amp;P 500 meant here, so we won\u2019t dive into that again. But this time we\u2019ll show just how this rally ranks versus others that ended major bear markets. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this new bull market, up to this point of about five months, is stronger than any other major bull market\u2019s start going back to World War II.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cYes, this new bull market is the strongest bull market we\u2019ve ever seen after five months,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut that shouldn\u2019t be a source of worry. The previous two strongest rallies up to this point were in 1982 and 2009, and both saw continued strength during the first year of the new bull market.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here is a chart showing just this bull market and the \u201982 and \u201909 bull markets.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years\n\n&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979).

September\u2019s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/RFx6btHt/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/QMTKbmHs/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.31.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HLV3Hxj.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.31.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HLWoNcY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  9.1.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4MRPa7I.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 9.1.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7dhII3i.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.2.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TROOwoH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L9FYSJe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.3.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7f5D5B7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4jUOy0x.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.4.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Zoom Video Communications, Inc. $299.27\n&gt; **Zoom Video Communications, Inc.

Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida speaks at 9 a.m. ET Monday on monetary policy. He is is one of several officials, who are expected to reiterate Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole message that the Fed would be willing to let inflation run hot temporarily to help the economy and job market.\n*****\n&gt; The low volume days of late summer should be a hallmark of the week ahead, but there could also be window dressing trades around the month\u2019s end, as investors rebalance holdings.\n*****\n&gt; On Monday, there could be some excitement around two of the market\u2019s favorite stocks. Apple begins trading after a 4-for-1 split. Tesla is also trading on a split-adjusted basis starting Monday, after it split its stock 5-for-1. Apple\u2019s split changes its weight in the Dow, so the index is being adjusted and there will be new names in the index Monday as some old ones leave. ExxonMobil, Pfizer and Raytheon will be replaced by Salesforce.com, Amgen and Honeywell.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.2% in the past week, and it could continue to make gains in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we\u2019re still going to be basking in the the glow of an accommodative Fed, combined with the increased accessibility of Apple\u2019s share price to retail investors,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said that after its last split in 2014, Apple gained 36% over the next year, but after its 2000 split as the tech bubble burst, it lost 60%. Apple has risen more than 30% since announcing its stock split on July 30.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was on track for a more than 6.9% gain in August, its best performance since 1986 if it holds that level through Monday. The S&amp;P recovered and surpassed its all time high during the month and is now flirting with the psychological 3,500 area.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has on average lost 0.5% in September, its worst month of the year going back to World War II, Stovall said. When the S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 5% in August, September gained an average 1.4% and was positive in four of the seven years also back to the 1940s, Stovall said.\n*****\n&gt; # Jobs, jobs, jobs\n&gt; Economists are slightly more optimistic about the economic data in the third quarter, but the job market has been an area of concern with unemployment claims still running around 1 million a week. According to Refinitiv, economists expect 1.4 million jobs were created in August, down from 1.76 million in July. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 9.8% from 10.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m assuming we just continue the momentum we saw in the prior month,\u201d said Aneta Markowska, Jefferies chief economist. Markowska said the monthly number has been difficult to forecast because the lack of correlation with unemployment claims, typically a strong barometer for monthly payrolls data but not as much since the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen really in the last two to three months is a sharp snapback in the hiring in the sectors that were most depressed in Covid. You have restaurant workers, leisure workers coming back,\u201d Markowska said. \u201cAt the same time, you\u2019re seeing a much smaller wave of layoffs in other industries. There was a second order knock-on affect, as a result of profit weakness and companies trying to cut costs as a result of that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said there\u2019s been a debate in the market for the last several weeks about whether jobs gains are beginning to flatline.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt strikes me that if you get a better-than-expected number that probably sends risk assets flying, but a somewhat worse-than-expected number would have less impact,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Schumacher said the market may pay some attention to so far floundering efforts in Washington for a new stimulus package. But he added the market has been ignoring the issue for now, as Congress appears to be getting further apart.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe are worried about the impact on these small businesses if there\u2019s no bridge for the next six months,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed message\n&gt; After Powell spoke at the Jackson Hole symposium Thursday, Treasury yields moved in a wide range. The 10-year note was as low as 0.65% and as high as 0.78% Friday, before settling in at about 0.74% in afternoon trading Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Powell said the Fed would be willing to let inflation rise a bit above 2% for awhile, and that it would now target an average without moving to tighten policy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market reaction to Powell was a little confusing. I suspect the Fed did not want to see this back-up in nominal yields and I suspect they\u2019ll push against it,\u201d said Markowska.\n*****\n&gt; Fed watchers said the message from Powell was that the Fed will likely keep rates lower for a longer period. Bond strategists said the market was responding to the idea of higher inflation, and rates were rising, particularly at the long end of the curve.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TLHe03j.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TfUKyzr.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/4yWqZND.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/LXBYRb7C/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oQ3yHrS.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VD6IBme.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YaBzNQp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/f3VmrXB.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/RFx6btHt/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/3xk18bTX/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/VNGzq6TQ/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/d1hw4FP7/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/Dzy24sxP/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Stocks: Worlds Apart\n\n&gt; If you've been paying attention this year, you know that the S&amp;P 500 has been carried by the performance of the index's largest components, and the chart below illustrates just how wide the disparity has been. It shows the YTD performance of each of the S&amp;P 500's members sorted by their market cap heading into 2020 with the largest stocks on the left side and the smallest stocks on the right. So far this year, the 50 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.3% YTD, and if we were to take an even narrower look at just the ten largest stocks heading into the year, the average YTD gain is over 27%!\n\n&gt; While the largest stocks are up a lot this year, the next 400 stocks in terms of market cap haven't fared nearly as well, averaging a decline of 2.0%. That's not great, but considering the pandemic this year, even a 2% decline isn't such a bad thing. The same can't be said for the smallest stocks in the S&amp;P, however. As shown below, the 50 smallest stocks are down an average of 15.3% YTD, and more than two-thirds of them are down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/0827-Individual-stocks.png))**\n\n&gt; Another way to illustrate the declining fortunes of stocks this year based on their size is by looking at a moving average of YTD stock performance across the market cap spectrum, In the chart below, the first point on the chart represents the performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 which have gained an average of 11.3% YTD. The next point to the right represents the average YTD change of the stocks that ranked between number 2 and 51 in terms of market cap at the start of 2020, and we continue that process down the entire list of components to the point where the last point in the series on the right side of the chart represents the average performance of the 50 smallest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 heading into the year. As mentioned above, that group of stocks has averaged a decline of 15.3% YTD. The performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 ranks as the fourth-best of 451 different points on the chart, while the basket of the 50 smallest stocks ranks as the 29th worst performing basket. In 2020, the bigger the stock, the better the returns.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/0827moving-average-YTD-performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Which Bull Will It Be?\n\n&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 bear market bottom continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 50% from those fateful lows. It feels like a lifetime since the longest bull market ever ended. Remember though, although the recent bull market was the longest, it wasn\u2019t the greatest, as the 1990s bull gained more on a percentage basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We discussed in detail what the new highs in the S&amp;P 500 meant here, so we won\u2019t dive into that again. But this time we\u2019ll show just how this rally ranks versus others that ended major bear markets. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this new bull market, up to this point of about five months, is stronger than any other major bull market\u2019s start going back to World War II.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cYes, this new bull market is the strongest bull market we\u2019ve ever seen after five months,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut that shouldn\u2019t be a source of worry. The previous two strongest rallies up to this point were in 1982 and 2009, and both saw continued strength during the first year of the new bull market.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here is a chart showing just this bull market and the \u201982 and \u201909 bull markets.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years\n\n&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September\u2019s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September\u2019s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/RFx6btHt/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/QMTKbmHs/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.31.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HLV3Hxj.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.31.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HLWoNcY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  9.1.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4MRPa7I.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 9.1.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7dhII3i.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.2.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TROOwoH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L9FYSJe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.3.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7f5D5B7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4jUOy0x.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.4.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Zoom Video Communications, Inc. $299.27\n&gt; **Zoom Video Communications, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 1st, 2020.\n\n# **Expect more shocking economic data in the week ahead with the unemployment rate set to near 20%  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/expect-more-shocking-economic-data-in-the-week-ahead-with-the-unemployment-rate-set-to-near-20percent.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The big rotation into unloved stocks, like banks, small caps and airlines, took a break Friday, but it could be a theme that dominates trading again in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will be assessing the progress of economic reopenings against some new headwinds for the market.\n*****\n&gt; The stock market has been mostly discounting unprecedented weakness in economic data, but the May employment report will still be of major interest Friday. Economists expect it to show another shocking loss of jobs, this time roughly 8.5 million after the 20.5 million lost in April. The unemployment rate is expected to jump to a staggering 19.8% from 14.7% in April, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Increasingly frayed relations between the U.S. and China reared up at the end of the week as a negative force for markets, and analysts expect that stress to continue to be a concern. The U.S. joined with other nations to condemn China\u2019s new security rules for Hong Kong, which Beijing sees as an attempt to quell protesters. \n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump on Friday said the U.S. would end its preferential relationship with Hong Kong and also exit agreements with the World Health Organization, which he said failed with China to protect the world from the spread of coronavirus. The stock market moved higher after Trump\u2019s afternoon announcement on relief there were no new trade actions against China.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHovering over this is geopolitical tensions. Over the weekend, what do we see out of Hong Kong? What do we see next week? This will be a major test for the west and specifically Washington,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the market will continue the tug of war as investors dip into value names versus some of the growth names in tech, and the stocks that had benefited from the stay-at-home trade.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe saw this early as the market came off the March lows. You had a very clear barbell,\u201d she said. \u201cThe market tried to say what do we need now, what do we need when this is over and health care and pharma started to get a very strong bid. What you have now is ... perhaps intermittent, the value names, the ones that were really beaten up, broadening out the market, including financials.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the social media and tech firms face dual headwinds, and that could hold back the overall market as well since they had been leaders in the move off of the March low.  Trump on Thursday issued an executive order aimed at limiting legal protections of social media companies, after he got into a disagreement with Twitter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a ratcheting up of pressure on technology firms and social media firms, a lot of overlap in big tech in terms of China exposure,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of headwinds facing Nasdaq names - shelter in place names and China-exposed technology names.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Big tech stocks have lagged lately, but they are still a top leader quarter to date, with a 20% gain. In the past week, they were up about a half percent, compared to a 6% gain in financials and 5% rise in industrials. As tech lagged, so did the Nasdaq, gaining only a third as much as the Dow in the past week. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis cyclical rally has longer to run, but what we\u2019ve seen this week tells you the index cannot continue to rise solely with the cyclical outperformance. Tuesday and Wednesday the financials outperformed Nasdaq by 9.3%,\u201d he said. Emanuel said the market usually does better when financials do better but this type of outperformance is rare and it doesn\u2019t always signal positives. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn average, the market is weaker in the medium term when you had that kind of massive outperformance. The message is both financials and technology tend to be weaker in the medium term. Longer term, you go back to the idea the rotation into financials is a positive,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the S&amp;P 500 may be hitting the top of a near-term range, after it broke through the 3,000 level, a key psychological point. It also broke through its its 200-day moving average, a widely watched technical level. Some investors see a buy signal when the S&amp;P  is above that momentum indicator, which is literally based on the average closing level of the index over the last 200 days.\n*****\n&gt; But Emanuel does not see that to be the case this time. \u201cWhen we look at the frantic activity in the rotation, it leads us to believe the market is likely to fall back into the range in the coming weeks,\u201d he said. \n*****\n&gt; The stocks that have outperformed recently are the most sensitive to the economic reopenings leading to a pickup in normal activity. There is a question of how much air traffic or hotel stays can pick up until there is real medical progress against the virus.  \n*****\n&gt; \u201cThese stocks will be a matter of intense debate for months. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll know the answer until we see if the fall brings a ratcheting higher of the virus, based on reopenings and a change in the weather, or if there\u2019s a change in progress on a vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; President Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to limit the federal law that provides broad legal protection for social media and other online platforms is one headwind for that sector. Trump issued the order Thursday after Twitter put a fact-check label one of his tweets criticizing mail-in election ballots. The president accused Twitter of political activism.\n*****\n&gt; Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet all protested the move, which hit Twitter\u2019s stock hardest.  \n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said technology\u2019 is at risk in China since companies like Apple have large revenue exposure in addition to supply chain issues.\n*****\n&gt; In addition to the jobs report, there is important ISM manufacturing data Monday and auto sales for the month of May.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jgJsTbC.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cn1jSFW.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/TMD5don.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/lMnJorQ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kHa6HqT.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZZOjRw4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FigEirb.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MjWiE2F.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PTfOn4g.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wh12Zf4.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8t94L91.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yC7JiMI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/nzEoxkl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Weekly Market Performance \u2013 May 29, 2020: Equities Continue Run During A Shortened Week.\n\n&gt; # Equities\n\n&gt; US equities delivered positive returns during this abbreviated trading week. All three indexes were higher, with the best performer being the Dow, while the Nasdaq lagged. The S&amp;P 500 finished the week above the 3,000 level for the first time since early March. The small cap Russell 2000 along with the mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index enjoyed positive weeks, with both indexes returning over 2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/WMP-May-29-2020.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThe S&amp;P 500 has incredibly bounced more than 35% from the March lows,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhich would be the best bear market rally ever, suggesting this very well isn\u2019t a bear market bounce, but the start of a new uptrend.\u201d\n\n&gt; The story of the week was a sharp rotation in the beaten up value sectors early on, as financials gained more than 6%, closely followed by real estate and industrials. Energy was the worst performing sector as oil price gains stalled, while communication services was the only other sector to lose ground on the week.\n\n&gt; Looking at style, large cap value stocks beat out large cap growth by over 2% for the week.\n\n&gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, labor and foreign policy challenges, along with risks associated with reopening the economy, US equities maintained their strength. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, such as an increase in new home sales along with an unexpected increase in consumer confidence. Our research suggests that second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.\n\n&gt; # International Stocks\n\n&gt; The MSCI EAFE and the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes continued its upward quest from the previous week, with the developed markets outperforming emerging markets by over 3%. Given the news out of Hong Kong last week as well as the Hang Seng\u2019s struggles last Friday, its market rebounded modestly to finish up only a fraction this week. With the new changes in Hong Kong\u2019s security laws, many are pondering the future of the nation/state as a global financial hub.\n\n&gt; The action by China in Hong Kong concerning its sovereignty caused Washington to move toward placing actions against Beijing. Moreover, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow added that the US may pay for companies to bring its supply chains from China and Hong Kong to the U.S.\n\n&gt; European markets were higher this week, with the STOXX Europe 600 Index up over 3%. As in the United States, investors are concerned with COVID-19 and the subsequent reopening of the European economy, but European stocks have held steady, as the pandemic has been slowing and countries are opening back up. Fiscal stimulus is in the air overseas, as the European Commission is reportedly set to propose a 750 billion euro recovery package, while Japan is finishing a $1.1 trillion stimulus package.\n\n&gt; # Fixed Income and Commodities\n\n&gt; Fixed income prices were little changed on the week, with the 10-year Treasury yield remaining under 0.70%. Credit spreads tightened modestly as investors appear optimistic about the prospects of reopening the US economy as well as a potential pickup in economic activity.\n\n&gt; Investment grade corporate debt issuance set a new record this week, with total new issues surpassing $1 trillion in just 149 days. This is a milestone typically reached in the second half of the year, as the Federal Reserve programs have suppressed yields, allowing corporations easier access to funding.\n\n&gt; Last month showed a record drop in consumer spending of over 13%, however personal savings enjoyed its largest surge ever at 33%. Once the economy reopens, we should expect these trends to reverse, which would thus help the economic landscape.\n\n&gt; Oil prices contracted modestly with July contracts for WTI crude posting a decline of about 2% for the week. Gold finished up a fraction, consolidating following an impressive rally of nearly 15% year to date.\n\n&gt; # Looking Ahead\n\n&gt; Economic data for next week begins with the Markit Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index data along with the ISM Manufacturing survey and construction spending on Monday. Contractions are expected in both given the present climate. Wednesday is all about the autos, as we get total number of cars and trucks sold in May. The consensus, according to Factset, is that 11 million total vehicles were sold last month.\n\n&gt; On Thursday, we receive new unemployment claims with optimism that the recent lower trend of claims continues. Also, we will get data on labor productivity along with the trade balance. To end the shortened week, Friday\u2019s reports will include non-farm payrolls along with the unemployment rate.\n\n*****\n\n# Strong Breadth Surge\n\n&gt; On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 Index closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since March 4. While that move marks an important milestone for an index that has rebounded more than 35% from its March 23 low, we believe market internals may paint an even more promising picture for future stock returns.\n\n&gt; Technology and growth stocks were undoubtedly the leaders during the market drop, and many of these stocks have recovered to the point of having positive year-to-date returns. Year-to-date numbers for financials and industrials have been less impressive, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve been left behind in the recovery. All 11 sectors have gained more than 20% from the March lows, and every sector, except for the defensive consumer staples sector, is up at least 30%, with energy\u2019s 59% advance leading the way. This has led to strong breadth, or market participation readings. Through Thursday\u2019s close, 96% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 were trading above their respective 50-day moving averages, the most since 1991.\n\n&gt; Perhaps more importantly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, these momentum surges historically have been followed by above-average forward returns. February 2019 was the last time more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 traded above their 50-day moving averages, and the S&amp;P 500 went on to post a 29% gain for the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.29.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cBreadth surges like we\u2019ve seen recently can signal short-term overbought conditions,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut for longer-term investors, they have historically marked uptrends with lasting durability.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# DJIA Up Seven Straight on June\u2019s First Trading Day\n\n&gt; According to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 (page 88), the first trading day of June is the third worst first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining just cumulative 304.59 points since 1998 (July is best with 1175.74 DJIA points gained). Over the past 25 years, DJIA\u2019s first trading day of June has produced gains 72.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.04%. Sizable losses in 2002, 2011 and 2012 limit overall performance. S&amp;P 500 has advanced 64.0% of the time. NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 56.0%. Russell 2000 has advanced 64.0% with the strongest average performance of 0.17%. Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA has advanced seven straight years on the first trading day of June.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/277f4afe57244973b48e6bc7c0844a6d/0d36c25bfef3f384-d6/s500x750/96efe19dba3ae99c075a91a11e892ad69fa23e56.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3cdaccd662828f8641c2e822c6df281/0d36c25bfef3f384-33/s500x750/6406f9afe4080788669a930cbe8dd4fb4a52ec28.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical June Trading: Early Gains Tend to Fade After Mid-Month\n\n&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-cap.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/37b672810df8d9c17e4fc69d49aaa9e8/439e24c2bd089fd0-d8/s500x750/5dc0af4ea6dbde69f39defca04e69534e9ac2eb7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# May's Top Performing Stocks\n\n&gt; After an absolutely amazing April, traders were in no mood to sell this May. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the 1,000 largest US stocks by market cap, the index's components rallied an average of 5.3% with just over 70% of the index's components trading up during the month. In the table below, we highlight some of the biggest winners. Some of these names may sound familiar, but there are bound to be a few that you've never heard of.\n\n&gt; This month, three stocks in the Russell 1000 gained more than 50%. The best of those three was Twilio (TWLO). After closing out April at a price of $112.3, the stock rallied 73% to just shy of $200 per share. So far in 2020, TWLO has almost doubled. Not familiar with TWLO? The company creates a number of APIs that enable voice, video, and messaging capabilities to their platforms. So when you get a text from UBER telling you that your car is on its way, that message is likely powered by TWLO's software.\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of this month's winners, like TWLO, a large share of the stocks listed come from the Technology sector. Of the 34 names on the list, 14 are form the Tech sector, and the next closest sector - Consumer Discretionary - has just seven stocks on the list. The top-performing stock from the Consumer Discretionary sector has been Wayfair (W), which has gained nearly 38%. Apparently, after being stuck at home for the last several weeks, many Americans have decided they need some new furniture.\n\n&gt; In total, eight of the eleven GICS sectors are represented on the list. The only sectors not making the cut? Financials, Real Estate, and Utilities. Maybe next month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052920-Best-MTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Most Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs Since 1991\n\n&gt; As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, if you were to pick out any one stock in the S&amp;P 500, odds are it would be above its 50-DMA. Currently, 96.24% of S&amp;P 500 stocks are above their 50-DMAs. On a sector basis, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Industrials, and Materials all have 100% of their stocks above their 50-DMAs. That is a huge share of the index sitting above their 50-DMAs at once. As shown in the chart below, times in which there have been this many stocks above their 50-DMAs have been few and far between. Of all days since the start of 1990, there have only been four other days with a reading as high or higher than the current 96.24%. The most recent of these was March 5th, 1991 when 96.59% of the index was above its 50-DMA. Other than that, only February 11th through 13th of that same year saw these types of readings (97.4%, 96.6%, and 97.8%, respectively).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052820-SP-Above.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Fund Flows Still Show Little Equities Enthusiasm\n\n&gt; The table below gives a summary of mutual and exchange-traded fund flows as compiled by the Investment Company Institute for the week ending May 20th.\n\n&gt; Equity fund flows remain negative. While there\u2019s been lots of anecdotal evidence of retail enthusiasm in the equity market, fund flows are a very different story. This week was relatively modest, with equity fund outflows in the bottom 6% of all readings across mutual funds and ETFs. That totals $13.7bn of AUM out the door, with the worst hits coming for global funds which saw flows in the bottom 3% of all readings. The last 3 months and year have been the worst on record for aggregate equity fund flows across mutual funds and ETFs, and the worst three months on record for world equity funds. ETFs tracking equities have not seen large inflows but they are also not suffering the same kind of outflows as mutual funds.\n\n&gt; Commodity funds and bond funds are a totally different story. The last three months have been the best on record for commodity fund inflows, while bond funds have seen readings in the top 3% of all periods for the last week and month; recent commodity fund flows are slightly cooler than their record pace of the last three months but are very, very strong nonetheless.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052820-Flows-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ZM** \n&gt; * **$CRWD** \n&gt; * **$DKS** \n&gt; * **$DOCU** \n&gt; * **$WORK** \n&gt; * **$CPB** \n&gt; * **$CBRL** \n&gt; * **$AVGO** \n&gt; * **$CLDR** \n&gt; * **$SJM** \n&gt; * **$ATHM** \n&gt; * **$CIEN** \n&gt; * **$AEO** \n&gt; * **$TTC** \n&gt; * **$BZUN** \n&gt; * **$APPS** \n&gt; * **$GOOS** \n&gt; * **$HQY** \n&gt; * **$HHR** \n&gt; * **$DCI** \n&gt; * **$EXPR** \n&gt; * **$SMAR** \n&gt; * **$VRA** \n&gt; * **$CMD** \n&gt; * **$AMBA** \n&gt; * **$ESTC** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$CNK** \n&gt; * **$ZUO** \n&gt; * **$MDB** \n&gt; * **$BBW** \n&gt; * **$NGL** \n&gt; * **$MIK** \n&gt; * **$GHG** \n&gt; * **$ENS** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$PD** \n&gt; * **$EVRI** \n&gt; * **$PLX** \n&gt; * **$YEXT** \n&gt; * **$GPS** \n&gt; * **$SAIC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PTfOn4g.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8D4J2yE.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.1.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QTN7mSn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.1.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/j1DpFQy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ij1xmhw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EIpBZjj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.3.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tvne0Pg.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lE0Nrw2.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wyHcBay.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/iZigl8T.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/b2NLnrm.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.5.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Zoom Video Communications, Inc. $179.48\n&gt; **Zoom Video Communications, Inc.

Option traders are pricing in a 6.4% move on earnings and the stock has averaged a 4.7% move in recent quarters.\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SJM&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 668415, "public", "self", "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 1st, 2020", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gtdum5/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "all_ads", 6, 1590839742.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bigbear0083", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_eaak0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1590843342, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gtdum5/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gtdum5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "news", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "866eb162-65e6-11e5-a903-1252b640afe9", "link_flair_text": "News", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/gtdum5/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "N0wat8KjlKdHs_jaZWAoxh7deMo5lJfJV7A1ncONKfU", "resolutions": [{"height": 66, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hTVuytLcb2FL2aqUupC-ils2CnmoF2WaHla-ihg1gLE.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8744ee3f64ba57755a7271785e3650fe74aa6de5", "width": 108}, {"height": 132, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hTVuytLcb2FL2aqUupC-ils2CnmoF2WaHla-ihg1gLE.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b5df5348d61ab6a82b46484f62d74ead257e252", "width": 216}, {"height": 197, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hTVuytLcb2FL2aqUupC-ils2CnmoF2WaHla-ihg1gLE.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf16862dbe81fc202343d9bc60197c6017fe6be4", "width": 320}, {"height": 394, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hTVuytLcb2FL2aqUupC-ils2CnmoF2WaHla-ihg1gLE.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0248d386c900b5889100f365f9131d7a60f47110", "width": 640}, {"height": 591, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hTVuytLcb2FL2aqUupC-ils2CnmoF2WaHla-ihg1gLE.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=575d809cc913ebf6d04089d7f78addc447553afc", "width": 960}, {"height": 664, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hTVuytLcb2FL2aqUupC-ils2CnmoF2WaHla-ihg1gLE.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f15e0fa86100d0936b38119d805bbda911e0e5f", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 761, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hTVuytLcb2FL2aqUupC-ils2CnmoF2WaHla-ihg1gLE.png?auto=webp&amp;s=726cf090485fe32989ef0ecb01be6d1cce20b37d", "width": 1236}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1590843344, "score": 1, "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 1st, 2020.\n\n# **Expect more shocking economic data in the week ahead with the unemployment rate set to near 20%  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/expect-more-shocking-economic-data-in-the-week-ahead-with-the-unemployment-rate-set-to-near-20percent.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The big rotation into unloved stocks, like banks, small caps and airlines, took a break Friday, but it could be a theme that dominates trading again in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will be assessing the progress of economic reopenings against some new headwinds for the market.\n*****\n&gt; The stock market has been mostly discounting unprecedented weakness in economic data, but the May employment report will still be of major interest Friday. Economists expect it to show another shocking loss of jobs, this time roughly 8.5 million after the 20.5 million lost in April. The unemployment rate is expected to jump to a staggering 19.8% from 14.7% in April, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Increasingly frayed relations between the U.S. and China reared up at the end of the week as a negative force for markets, and analysts expect that stress to continue to be a concern. The U.S. joined with other nations to condemn China\u2019s new security rules for Hong Kong, which Beijing sees as an attempt to quell protesters. \n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump on Friday said the U.S. would end its preferential relationship with Hong Kong and also exit agreements with the World Health Organization, which he said failed with China to protect the world from the spread of coronavirus. The stock market moved higher after Trump\u2019s afternoon announcement on relief there were no new trade actions against China.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHovering over this is geopolitical tensions. Over the weekend, what do we see out of Hong Kong? What do we see next week? This will be a major test for the west and specifically Washington,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the market will continue the tug of war as investors dip into value names versus some of the growth names in tech, and the stocks that had benefited from the stay-at-home trade.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe saw this early as the market came off the March lows. You had a very clear barbell,\u201d she said. \u201cThe market tried to say what do we need now, what do we need when this is over and health care and pharma started to get a very strong bid. What you have now is ... perhaps intermittent, the value names, the ones that were really beaten up, broadening out the market, including financials.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the social media and tech firms face dual headwinds, and that could hold back the overall market as well since they had been leaders in the move off of the March low.  Trump on Thursday issued an executive order aimed at limiting legal protections of social media companies, after he got into a disagreement with Twitter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a ratcheting up of pressure on technology firms and social media firms, a lot of overlap in big tech in terms of China exposure,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of headwinds facing Nasdaq names - shelter in place names and China-exposed technology names.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Big tech stocks have lagged lately, but they are still a top leader quarter to date, with a 20% gain. In the past week, they were up about a half percent, compared to a 6% gain in financials and 5% rise in industrials. As tech lagged, so did the Nasdaq, gaining only a third as much as the Dow in the past week. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis cyclical rally has longer to run, but what we\u2019ve seen this week tells you the index cannot continue to rise solely with the cyclical outperformance. Tuesday and Wednesday the financials outperformed Nasdaq by 9.3%,\u201d he said. Emanuel said the market usually does better when financials do better but this type of outperformance is rare and it doesn\u2019t always signal positives. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn average, the market is weaker in the medium term when you had that kind of massive outperformance. The message is both financials and technology tend to be weaker in the medium term. Longer term, you go back to the idea the rotation into financials is a positive,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the S&amp;P 500 may be hitting the top of a near-term range, after it broke through the 3,000 level, a key psychological point. It also broke through its its 200-day moving average, a widely watched technical level. Some investors see a buy signal when the S&amp;P  is above that momentum indicator, which is literally based on the average closing level of the index over the last 200 days.\n*****\n&gt; But Emanuel does not see that to be the case this time. \u201cWhen we look at the frantic activity in the rotation, it leads us to believe the market is likely to fall back into the range in the coming weeks,\u201d he said. \n*****\n&gt; The stocks that have outperformed recently are the most sensitive to the economic reopenings leading to a pickup in normal activity. There is a question of how much air traffic or hotel stays can pick up until there is real medical progress against the virus.  \n*****\n&gt; \u201cThese stocks will be a matter of intense debate for months. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll know the answer until we see if the fall brings a ratcheting higher of the virus, based on reopenings and a change in the weather, or if there\u2019s a change in progress on a vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; President Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to limit the federal law that provides broad legal protection for social media and other online platforms is one headwind for that sector. Trump issued the order Thursday after Twitter put a fact-check label one of his tweets criticizing mail-in election ballots. The president accused Twitter of political activism.\n*****\n&gt; Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet all protested the move, which hit Twitter\u2019s stock hardest.  \n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said technology\u2019 is at risk in China since companies like Apple have large revenue exposure in addition to supply chain issues.\n*****\n&gt; In addition to the jobs report, there is important ISM manufacturing data Monday and auto sales for the month of May.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jgJsTbC.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cn1jSFW.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/TMD5don.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/lMnJorQ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kHa6HqT.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZZOjRw4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FigEirb.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MjWiE2F.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PTfOn4g.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wh12Zf4.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8t94L91.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yC7JiMI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/nzEoxkl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Weekly Market Performance \u2013 May 29, 2020: Equities Continue Run During A Shortened Week.\n\n&gt; # Equities\n\n&gt; US equities delivered positive returns during this abbreviated trading week. All three indexes were higher, with the best performer being the Dow, while the Nasdaq lagged. The S&amp;P 500 finished the week above the 3,000 level for the first time since early March. The small cap Russell 2000 along with the mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index enjoyed positive weeks, with both indexes returning over 2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/WMP-May-29-2020.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThe S&amp;P 500 has incredibly bounced more than 35% from the March lows,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhich would be the best bear market rally ever, suggesting this very well isn\u2019t a bear market bounce, but the start of a new uptrend.\u201d\n\n&gt; The story of the week was a sharp rotation in the beaten up value sectors early on, as financials gained more than 6%, closely followed by real estate and industrials. Energy was the worst performing sector as oil price gains stalled, while communication services was the only other sector to lose ground on the week.\n\n&gt; Looking at style, large cap value stocks beat out large cap growth by over 2% for the week.\n\n&gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, labor and foreign policy challenges, along with risks associated with reopening the economy, US equities maintained their strength. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, such as an increase in new home sales along with an unexpected increase in consumer confidence. Our research suggests that second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.\n\n&gt; # International Stocks\n\n&gt; The MSCI EAFE and the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes continued its upward quest from the previous week, with the developed markets outperforming emerging markets by over 3%. Given the news out of Hong Kong last week as well as the Hang Seng\u2019s struggles last Friday, its market rebounded modestly to finish up only a fraction this week. With the new changes in Hong Kong\u2019s security laws, many are pondering the future of the nation/state as a global financial hub.\n\n&gt; The action by China in Hong Kong concerning its sovereignty caused Washington to move toward placing actions against Beijing. Moreover, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow added that the US may pay for companies to bring its supply chains from China and Hong Kong to the U.S.\n\n&gt; European markets were higher this week, with the STOXX Europe 600 Index up over 3%. As in the United States, investors are concerned with COVID-19 and the subsequent reopening of the European economy, but European stocks have held steady, as the pandemic has been slowing and countries are opening back up. Fiscal stimulus is in the air overseas, as the European Commission is reportedly set to propose a 750 billion euro recovery package, while Japan is finishing a $1.1 trillion stimulus package.\n\n&gt; # Fixed Income and Commodities\n\n&gt; Fixed income prices were little changed on the week, with the 10-year Treasury yield remaining under 0.70%. Credit spreads tightened modestly as investors appear optimistic about the prospects of reopening the US economy as well as a potential pickup in economic activity.\n\n&gt; Investment grade corporate debt issuance set a new record this week, with total new issues surpassing $1 trillion in just 149 days. This is a milestone typically reached in the second half of the year, as the Federal Reserve programs have suppressed yields, allowing corporations easier access to funding.\n\n&gt; Last month showed a record drop in consumer spending of over 13%, however personal savings enjoyed its largest surge ever at 33%. Once the economy reopens, we should expect these trends to reverse, which would thus help the economic landscape.\n\n&gt; Oil prices contracted modestly with July contracts for WTI crude posting a decline of about 2% for the week. Gold finished up a fraction, consolidating following an impressive rally of nearly 15% year to date.\n\n&gt; # Looking Ahead\n\n&gt; Economic data for next week begins with the Markit Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index data along with the ISM Manufacturing survey and construction spending on Monday. Contractions are expected in both given the present climate. Wednesday is all about the autos, as we get total number of cars and trucks sold in May. The consensus, according to Factset, is that 11 million total vehicles were sold last month.\n\n&gt; On Thursday, we receive new unemployment claims with optimism that the recent lower trend of claims continues. Also, we will get data on labor productivity along with the trade balance. To end the shortened week, Friday\u2019s reports will include non-farm payrolls along with the unemployment rate.\n\n*****\n\n# Strong Breadth Surge\n\n&gt; On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 Index closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since March 4. While that move marks an important milestone for an index that has rebounded more than 35% from its March 23 low, we believe market internals may paint an even more promising picture for future stock returns.\n\n&gt; Technology and growth stocks were undoubtedly the leaders during the market drop, and many of these stocks have recovered to the point of having positive year-to-date returns. Year-to-date numbers for financials and industrials have been less impressive, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve been left behind in the recovery. All 11 sectors have gained more than 20% from the March lows, and every sector, except for the defensive consumer staples sector, is up at least 30%, with energy\u2019s 59% advance leading the way. This has led to strong breadth, or market participation readings. Through Thursday\u2019s close, 96% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 were trading above their respective 50-day moving averages, the most since 1991.\n\n&gt; Perhaps more importantly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, these momentum surges historically have been followed by above-average forward returns. February 2019 was the last time more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 traded above their 50-day moving averages, and the S&amp;P 500 went on to post a 29% gain for the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.29.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cBreadth surges like we\u2019ve seen recently can signal short-term overbought conditions,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut for longer-term investors, they have historically marked uptrends with lasting durability.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# DJIA Up Seven Straight on June\u2019s First Trading Day\n\n&gt; According to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 (page 88), the first trading day of June is the third worst first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining just cumulative 304.59 points since 1998 (July is best with 1175.74 DJIA points gained). Over the past 25 years, DJIA\u2019s first trading day of June has produced gains 72.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.04%. Sizable losses in 2002, 2011 and 2012 limit overall performance. S&amp;P 500 has advanced 64.0% of the time. NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 56.0%. Russell 2000 has advanced 64.0% with the strongest average performance of 0.17%. Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA has advanced seven straight years on the first trading day of June.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/277f4afe57244973b48e6bc7c0844a6d/0d36c25bfef3f384-d6/s500x750/96efe19dba3ae99c075a91a11e892ad69fa23e56.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3cdaccd662828f8641c2e822c6df281/0d36c25bfef3f384-33/s500x750/6406f9afe4080788669a930cbe8dd4fb4a52ec28.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical June Trading: Early Gains Tend to Fade After Mid-Month\n\n&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-cap.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/37b672810df8d9c17e4fc69d49aaa9e8/439e24c2bd089fd0-d8/s500x750/5dc0af4ea6dbde69f39defca04e69534e9ac2eb7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# May's Top Performing Stocks\n\n&gt; After an absolutely amazing April, traders were in no mood to sell this May. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the 1,000 largest US stocks by market cap, the index's components rallied an average of 5.3% with just over 70% of the index's components trading up during the month. In the table below, we highlight some of the biggest winners. Some of these names may sound familiar, but there are bound to be a few that you've never heard of.\n\n&gt; This month, three stocks in the Russell 1000 gained more than 50%. The best of those three was Twilio (TWLO). After closing out April at a price of $112.3, the stock rallied 73% to just shy of $200 per share. So far in 2020, TWLO has almost doubled. Not familiar with TWLO? The company creates a number of APIs that enable voice, video, and messaging capabilities to their platforms. So when you get a text from UBER telling you that your car is on its way, that message is likely powered by TWLO's software.\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of this month's winners, like TWLO, a large share of the stocks listed come from the Technology sector. Of the 34 names on the list, 14 are form the Tech sector, and the next closest sector - Consumer Discretionary - has just seven stocks on the list. The top-performing stock from the Consumer Discretionary sector has been Wayfair (W), which has gained nearly 38%. Apparently, after being stuck at home for the last several weeks, many Americans have decided they need some new furniture.\n\n&gt; In total, eight of the eleven GICS sectors are represented on the list. The only sectors not making the cut? Financials, Real Estate, and Utilities. Maybe next month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052920-Best-MTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Most Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs Since 1991\n\n&gt; As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, if you were to pick out any one stock in the S&amp;P 500, odds are it would be above its 50-DMA. Currently, 96.24% of S&amp;P 500 stocks are above their 50-DMAs. On a sector basis, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Industrials, and Materials all have 100% of their stocks above their 50-DMAs. That is a huge share of the index sitting above their 50-DMAs at once. As shown in the chart below, times in which there have been this many stocks above their 50-DMAs have been few and far between. Of all days since the start of 1990, there have only been four other days with a reading as high or higher than the current 96.24%. The most recent of these was March 5th, 1991 when 96.59% of the index was above its 50-DMA. Other than that, only February 11th through 13th of that same year saw these types of readings (97.4%, 96.6%, and 97.8%, respectively).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052820-SP-Above.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Fund Flows Still Show Little Equities Enthusiasm\n\n&gt; The table below gives a summary of mutual and exchange-traded fund flows as compiled by the Investment Company Institute for the week ending May 20th.\n\n&gt; Equity fund flows remain negative. While there\u2019s been lots of anecdotal evidence of retail enthusiasm in the equity market, fund flows are a very different story. This week was relatively modest, with equity fund outflows in the bottom 6% of all readings across mutual funds and ETFs. That totals $13.7bn of AUM out the door, with the worst hits coming for global funds which saw flows in the bottom 3% of all readings. The last 3 months and year have been the worst on record for aggregate equity fund flows across mutual funds and ETFs, and the worst three months on record for world equity funds. ETFs tracking equities have not seen large inflows but they are also not suffering the same kind of outflows as mutual funds.\n\n&gt; Commodity funds and bond funds are a totally different story. The last three months have been the best on record for commodity fund inflows, while bond funds have seen readings in the top 3% of all periods for the last week and month; recent commodity fund flows are slightly cooler than their record pace of the last three months but are very, very strong nonetheless.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052820-Flows-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ZM** \n&gt; * **$CRWD** \n&gt; * **$DKS** \n&gt; * **$DOCU** \n&gt; * **$WORK** \n&gt; * **$CPB** \n&gt; * **$CBRL** \n&gt; * **$AVGO** \n&gt; * **$CLDR** \n&gt; * **$SJM** \n&gt; * **$ATHM** \n&gt; * **$CIEN** \n&gt; * **$AEO** \n&gt; * **$TTC** \n&gt; * **$BZUN** \n&gt; * **$APPS** \n&gt; * **$GOOS** \n&gt; * **$HQY** \n&gt; * **$HHR** \n&gt; * **$DCI** \n&gt; * **$EXPR** \n&gt; * **$SMAR** \n&gt; * **$VRA** \n&gt; * **$CMD** \n&gt; * **$AMBA** \n&gt; * **$ESTC** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$CNK** \n&gt; * **$ZUO** \n&gt; * **$MDB** \n&gt; * **$BBW** \n&gt; * **$NGL** \n&gt; * **$MIK** \n&gt; * **$GHG** \n&gt; * **$ENS** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$PD** \n&gt; * **$EVRI** \n&gt; * **$PLX** \n&gt; * **$YEXT** \n&gt; * **$GPS** \n&gt; * **$SAIC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PTfOn4g.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8D4J2yE.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.1.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QTN7mSn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.1.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/j1DpFQy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ij1xmhw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EIpBZjj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.3.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tvne0Pg.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lE0Nrw2.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wyHcBay.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/iZigl8T.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/b2NLnrm.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.5.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Zoom Video Communications, Inc. $179.48\n&gt; **Zoom Video Communications, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week and month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 9th, 2020.\n\n# **Wall Street braces for more market volatility as wild swings become the \u2018new normal\u2019 amid coronavirus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/investors-brace-for-more-volatility-as-wild-swings-become-new-normal.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has never behaved like this, but Wall Street strategists say get used to it.\n*****\n&gt; Investors just witnessed the equity benchmark swinging up or down 2% for four days straight in the face of the coronavirus panic.\n*****\n&gt; In the index\u2019s history dating back to 1927, this is the first time the S&amp;P 500 had a week of alternating gains and losses of more than 2% from Monday through Thursday, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Daily swings like this over a two-week period were only seen at the peak of the financial crisis and in 2011 when U.S. sovereign debt got its first-ever downgrade, the firm said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe message to all investors is that they should expect this volatility to continue. This should be considered the new normal going forward,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped north of 1,000 points twice in the past week, only to erase the quadruple-digit gains in the subsequent sessions. The coronavirus outbreak kept investors on edge as global cases of the infections surpassed 100,000. It\u2019s also spreading rapidly in the U.S. California has declared a state of emergency, while the number of cases in New York reached 33.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cUncertainty breeds greater market volatility,\u201d Keith Lerner, SunTrust\u2019s chief market strategist, said in a note. \u201cMuch is still unknown about how severe and widespread the coronavirus will become. From a market perspective, what we are seeing is uncomfortable but somewhat typical after shock periods.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # More stimulus?\n&gt; So far, the actions from global central banks and governments in response to the outbreak haven\u2019t triggered a sustainable rebound.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis did little to calm investor anxiety. President Donald Trump on Friday signed a sweeping spending bill with an$8.3 billion packageto aid prevention efforts to produce a vaccine for the deadly disease, but stocks extended their heavy rout that day.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is recognizing the global authorities are responding to this,\u201d said Tom Essaye, founder of the Sevens Report. \u201cIf the market begins to worry they are not doing that sufficiently, then I think we are going to go down ugly. It is helping stocks hold up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Essaye said any further stimulus from China and a decent-sized fiscal package from Germany would be positive to the market, but he doesn\u2019t expect the moves to create a huge rebound.\n*****\n&gt; The fed funds future market is now pricing in the possibility of the U.S. central bank cutting by 75 basis points at its March 17-18 meeting.\n*****\n&gt; # Where is the bottom?\n&gt; Many on Wall Street expect the market to fall further before recovering as the health crisis unfolds.\n*****\n&gt; Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief equity strategist, sees a bottom for the S&amp;P 500 in the second quarter after stocks falling as much as 20% from their recent peak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe magnitude of the selloff in the S&amp;P 500 so far has further to go; and in terms of duration, just two weeks in, it is much too early to declare this episode as being done,\u201d Chadha said in a note. \u201cWe do view the impacts on macro and earnings growth as being relatively short-lived and the market eventually looking through them.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Deutsche Bank maintained its year-end target of 3,250 for the S&amp;P 500, which would represent a 10% gain from here and a flat return for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists are also urging patience during this heightened volatility, cautioning against panic selling.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt is during times like these that investors need to maintain a longer-term perspective and stick to their investment process rather than making knee-jerk, binary decisions,\u201d Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qgFoWQB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7eQW0Js.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mFotkBJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/XSXVPJQ.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/deKt8eq.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HYaxtrz.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yygsO0C.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oCNZNbl.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y35bngj.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/E6twMcN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ttAWeD2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Dl7NlBA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A \"Run of the Mill\" Drawdown\n\n&gt; If you're like us, you've heard a lot of people reference the recent equity declines as a sign that the market is pricing in some sort of Armageddon in the US economy. While comments like that make for great soundbites, a little perspective is in order. Since the S&amp;P 500's high on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500 is down 12.8%. In the chart below, we show the S&amp;P 500's annual maximum drawdown by year going back to 1928. In the entire history of the index, the median maximum drawdown from a YTD high is 13.05%. In other words, this year's decline is actually less than normal. Perhaps due to the fact that we have only seen one larger-than-average drawdown in the last eight years is why this one feels so bad.\n\n&gt; The fact that the current decline has only been inline with the historical norm raises a number of questions. For example, if the market has already priced in the worst-case scenario, going out and adding some equity exposure would be a no brainer. However, if we're only in the midst of a 'normal' drawdown in the equity market as the coronavirus outbreak threatens to put the economy into a recession, one could argue that things for the stock market could get worse before they get better, especially when we know that the market can be prone to over-reaction in both directions. The fact is that nobody knows right now how this entire outbreak will play out. If it really is a black swan, the market definitely has further to fall and now would present a great opportunity to sell more equities. However, if it proves to be temporary and after a quarter or two resolves itself and the economy gets back on the path it was on at the start of the year, then the magnitude of the current decline is probably appropriate. As they say, that's what makes a market!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Drawdowns.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Long-Term Treasuries Go Haywire\n\n&gt; Take a good luck at today's moves in long-term US Treasury yields, because chances are you won't see moves of this magnitude again soon. Let's start with the yield on the 30-year US Treasury. Today's decline of 29 basis points in the yield will go down as the largest one-day decline in the yield on the 30-year since 2009. For some perspective, there have only been 25 other days since 1977 where the yield saw a larger one day decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; That doesn't even tell the whole story, though. As shown in the chart below, every other time the yield saw a sharper one-day decline, the actual yield of the 30-year was much higher, and in most other cases it was much, much higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Yield.png))**\n\n&gt; To show this another way, the percentage change in the yield on the 30-year has never been seen before, and it's not even close. Now, before the chart crime police come calling, we realize showing a percentage change of a percentage is not the most accurate representation, but we wanted to show this for illustrative purposes only.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Percent-change-in-yield.png))**\n\n&gt; Finally, with long-term interest rates plummetting we wanted to provide an update on the performance of the Austrian 100-year bond. That's now back at record highs, begging the question, why is the US not flooding the market with long-term debt?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Austria.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It Doesn't Get Much Worse Than This For Crude Oil\n\n&gt; Crude oil prices are down close to 10% today in what is shaping up to be the worst day for crude oil since late 2014. That's more than five years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-Daily-Changes.png))**\n\n&gt; Today's decline is pretty much a continuation of what has been a one-way trade for the commodity ever since the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani. The last time prices were this low was around Christmas 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil.png))**\n\n&gt; With today's decline, crude oil is now off to its worst start to a year in a generation falling 32%. Since 1984, the only other year that was worse was 1986 when the year started out with a decline of 50% through March 6th. If you're looking for a bright spot, in 1986, prices rose 36% over the remainder of the year. The only other year where crude oil kicked off the year with a 30% decline was in 1991 after the first Iraq war. Over the remainder of that year, prices rose a more modest 5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-YTD-Starts.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Year Treasury Yield Breaks Below 1%\n\n&gt; Despite strong market gains on Wednesday, March 4, 2020, the on-the-run 10-year Treasury yield ended the day below 1% for the first time ever and has posted additional declines in real time, sitting at 0.92% intraday as this blog is being written. \u201cThe decline in yields has been remarkable,\u201d said LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe 10-year Treasury yield has dipped below 1%, and today\u2019s declines are likely to make the recent run lower the largest decline of the cycle.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in LPL Research\u2019s chart of the day, the current decline in the 10-year Treasury yield without a meaningful reversal (defined as at least 0.75%) is approaching the decline seen in 2011 and 2012 and would need about another two months to be the longest decline in length of time. At the same time, no prior decline has lasted forever and a pattern of declines and increases has been normal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-chart-3.5.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield lower?\n\n&gt; * A shrinking but still sizable yield advantage over other developed market sovereign debt\n&gt; * Added stock volatility if downside risks to economic growth from the coronavirus increase\n&gt; * A larger potential premium over shorter-term yields if the Federal Reserve aggressively cuts interest rates\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield higher?\n\n&gt; * A second half economic rebound acting a catalyst for a Treasury sell-off\n&gt; * As yields move lower, investors may increasingly seek more attractive sources of income\n&gt; * Any dollar weakness could lead to some selling by international investors\n&gt; * Longer maturity Treasuries are looking like an increasingly crowded trade, potentially adding energy to any sell-off\n\n&gt; On balance, our view remains that the prospect of an economic rebound over the second half points to the potential for interest rates moving higher. At the same time, we still see some advantage in the potential diversification benefits of intermediate maturity high-quality bonds, especially during periods of market stress. We continue to recommend that suitable investors consider keeping a bond portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates below that of the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index by emphasizing short to intermediate maturity bonds, but do not believe it\u2019s time to pile into very short maturities despite the 10-year Treasury yield sitting at historically low levels.\n\n*****\n\n# U.S. Jobs Growth Marches On\n\n&gt; While stock markets continue to be extremely volatile as they come to terms with how the coronavirus may affect global growth, the U.S. job market has remained remarkably robust. Continued U.S. jobs data resilience in the face of headwinds from the coronavirus outbreak may be a key factor in prolonging the expansion, given how important the strength of the U.S. consumer has been late into this expansion.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Department of Labor today reported that U.S. nonfarm payroll data had a strong showing of 273,000 jobs added in February, topping the expectation of every Bloomberg-surveyed economist, with an additional upward revision of 85,000 additional jobs for December 2019 and January 2020. This has brought the current unemployment rate back to its 50-year low of 3.5%. So far, it appears it\u2019s too soon for any effects of the coronavirus to have been felt in the jobs numbers. (Note: The survey takes place in the middle of each month.)\n\n&gt; On Wednesday, ADP released its private payroll data (excluding government jobs), which increased by 183,000 in February, also handily beating market expectations. Most of these jobs were added in the service sector, with 44,000 added in the leisure and hospitality sector, and another 31,000 in trade/transportation/utilities. Both of these areas could be at risk of potential cutbacks if consumers start to avoid eating out or other leisure pursuits due to coronavirus fears.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, payrolls remain strong, and any effects of the virus outbreaks most likely would be felt in coming months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/US-Jobs-Data.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFebruary\u2019s jobs report shows the 113th straight month that the U.S. jobs market has grown,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s an incredible run and highlights how the U.S. consumer has become key to extending the expansion, especially given setbacks to global growth from the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d\n\n&gt; While there is bound to be some drag on future jobs data from the coronavirus-related slowdown, we would anticipate that the effects of this may be transitory. We believe economic fundamentals continue to suggest the possibility of a second-half-of-the\u2013year economic rebound.\n\n*****\n\n# Down January &amp; Down February: S&amp;P 500 Posts Full-Year Gain Just 43.75% of Time\n\n&gt; The combination of a down January and a down February has come about 17 times, including this year, going back to 1950. Rest of the year and full-year performance has taken a rather sizable hit following the previous 16 occurrences. March through December S&amp;P 500 average performance drops to 2.32% compared to 7.69% in all years. Full-year performance is even worse with S&amp;P 500 average turning to a loss of 4.91% compared to an average gain of 9.14% in all years. All hope for 2020 is not lost as seven of the 16 past down January and down February years did go on to log gains over the last 10 months and full year while six enjoyed double-digit gains from March to December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/781e034df22d242349ff3f8882653cec/b4f07d98317a2635-4d/s500x750/0ea61b1c01085e74593633995acba59fe8a96ce8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Take Caution After Emergency Rate Cut\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s big rally was an encouraging sign that the markets are becoming more comfortable with the public health, monetary and political handling of the situation. But the history of these \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201csurprise\u201d rate cuts by the Fed between meetings suggest some caution remains in order.\n\n&gt; The table here shows that these surprise cuts between meetings have really only \u201cworked\u201d once in the past 20+ years. In 1998 when the Fed and the plunge protection team acted swiftly and in a coordinated manner to stave off the fallout from the financial crisis caused by the collapse of the Russian ruble and the highly leveraged Long Term Capital Management hedge fund markets responded well. This was not the case during the extended bear markets of 2001-2002 and 2007-2009.\n\n&gt; Bottom line: if this is a short-term impact like the 1998 financial crisis the market should recover sooner rather than later. But if the economic impact of coronavirus virus is prolonged, the market is more likely to languish.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd9ae8723eaf077f8baa56e384c8d8f7/e543b6eee32cdf93-81/s500x750/0f2b63108953c1e4cfb97da0a979d4ab3651cdeb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$DKS**\n&gt; * **$AVGO** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$WORK** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$DOCU** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$CLDR** \n&gt; * **$INSG** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$BTAI** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$HEAR** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$ADDYY** \n&gt; * **$GPS** \n&gt; * **$AKBA** \n&gt; * **$PDD** \n&gt; * **$CYOU** \n&gt; * **$FNV** \n&gt; * **$MTNB** \n&gt; * **$NERV** \n&gt; * **$MTN** \n&gt; * **$BEST** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$NINE** \n&gt; * **$AZUL** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$PRPL** \n&gt; * **$VSLR** \n&gt; * **$KLZE** \n&gt; * **$ZUO** \n&gt; * **$DVAX** \n&gt; * **$EXPR** \n&gt; * **$VRA** \n&gt; * **$AXSM** \n&gt; * **$CDMO** \n&gt; * **$CASY**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MY5URDI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Fq1ixYG.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3QxCDMd.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/kG5Cja7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWb2ADY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SH8bsTn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PH2Inly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RToRF8p.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HECD2g3.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvEJ9Vw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $336.77\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

Daily swings like this over a two-week period were only seen at the peak of the financial crisis and in 2011 when U.S. sovereign debt got its first-ever downgrade, the firm said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe message to all investors is that they should expect this volatility to continue. This should be considered the new normal going forward,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped north of 1,000 points twice in the past week, only to erase the quadruple-digit gains in the subsequent sessions.

President Donald Trump on Friday signed a sweeping spending bill with an$8.3 billion packageto aid prevention efforts to produce a vaccine for the deadly disease, but stocks extended their heavy rout that day.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is recognizing the global authorities are responding to this,\u201d said Tom Essaye, founder of the Sevens Report. \u201cIf the market begins to worry they are not doing that sufficiently, then I think we are going to go down ugly.

While comments like that make for great soundbites, a little perspective is in order. Since the S&amp;P 500's high on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500 is down 12.8%. In the chart below, we show the S&amp;P 500's annual maximum drawdown by year going back to 1928. In the entire history of the index, the median maximum drawdown from a YTD high is 13.05%. In other words, this year's decline is actually less than normal. Perhaps due to the fact that we have only seen one larger-than-average drawdown in the last eight years is why this one feels so bad.\n\n&gt; The fact that the current decline has only been inline with the historical norm raises a number of questions. For example, if the market has already priced in the worst-case scenario, going out and adding some equity exposure would be a no brainer. However, if we're only in the midst of a 'normal' drawdown in the equity market as the coronavirus outbreak threatens to put the economy into a recession, one could argue that things for the stock market could get worse before they get better, especially when we know that the market can be prone to over-reaction in both directions. The fact is that nobody knows right now how this entire outbreak will play out. If it really is a black swan, the market definitely has further to fall and now would present a great opportunity to sell more equities. However, if it proves to be temporary and after a quarter or two resolves itself and the economy gets back on the path it was on at the start of the year, then the magnitude of the current decline is probably appropriate. As they say, that's what makes a market!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Drawdowns.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Long-Term Treasuries Go Haywire\n\n&gt; Take a good luck at today's moves in long-term US Treasury yields, because chances are you won't see moves of this magnitude again soon. Let's start with the yield on the 30-year US Treasury. Today's decline of 29 basis points in the yield will go down as the largest one-day decline in the yield on the 30-year since 2009. For some perspective, there have only been 25 other days since 1977 where the yield saw a larger one day decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; That doesn't even tell the whole story, though. As shown in the chart below, every other time the yield saw a sharper one-day decline, the actual yield of the 30-year was much higher, and in most other cases it was much, much higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Yield.png))**\n\n&gt; To show this another way, the percentage change in the yield on the 30-year has never been seen before, and it's not even close. Now, before the chart crime police come calling, we realize showing a percentage change of a percentage is not the most accurate representation, but we wanted to show this for illustrative purposes only.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Percent-change-in-yield.png))**\n\n&gt; Finally, with long-term interest rates plummetting we wanted to provide an update on the performance of the Austrian 100-year bond. That's now back at record highs, begging the question, why is the US not flooding the market with long-term debt?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Austria.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It Doesn't Get Much Worse Than This For Crude Oil\n\n&gt; Crude oil prices are down close to 10% today in what is shaping up to be the worst day for crude oil since late 2014. That's more than five years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-Daily-Changes.png))**\n\n&gt; Today's decline is pretty much a continuation of what has been a one-way trade for the commodity ever since the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani. The last time prices were this low was around Christmas 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil.png))**\n\n&gt; With today's decline, crude oil is now off to its worst start to a year in a generation falling 32%. Since 1984, the only other year that was worse was 1986 when the year started out with a decline of 50% through March 6th. If you're looking for a bright spot, in 1986, prices rose 36% over the remainder of the year. The only other year where crude oil kicked off the year with a 30% decline was in 1991 after the first Iraq war. Over the remainder of that year, prices rose a more modest 5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-YTD-Starts.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Year Treasury Yield Breaks Below 1%\n\n&gt; Despite strong market gains on Wednesday, March 4, 2020, the on-the-run 10-year Treasury yield ended the day below 1% for the first time ever and has posted additional declines in real time, sitting at 0.92% intraday as this blog is being written. \u201cThe decline in yields has been remarkable,\u201d said LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe 10-year Treasury yield has dipped below 1%, and today\u2019s declines are likely to make the recent run lower the largest decline of the cycle.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in LPL Research\u2019s chart of the day, the current decline in the 10-year Treasury yield without a meaningful reversal (defined as at least 0.75%) is approaching the decline seen in 2011 and 2012 and would need about another two months to be the longest decline in length of time. At the same time, no prior decline has lasted forever and a pattern of declines and increases has been normal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-chart-3.5.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield lower?\n\n&gt; * A shrinking but still sizable yield advantage over other developed market sovereign debt\n&gt; * Added stock volatility if downside risks to economic growth from the coronavirus increase\n&gt; * A larger potential premium over shorter-term yields if the Federal Reserve aggressively cuts interest rates\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield higher?\n\n&gt; * A second half economic rebound acting a catalyst for a Treasury sell-off\n&gt; * As yields move lower, investors may increasingly seek more attractive sources of income\n&gt; * Any dollar weakness could lead to some selling by international investors\n&gt; * Longer maturity Treasuries are looking like an increasingly crowded trade, potentially adding energy to any sell-off\n\n&gt; On balance, our view remains that the prospect of an economic rebound over the second half points to the potential for interest rates moving higher. At the same time, we still see some advantage in the potential diversification benefits of intermediate maturity high-quality bonds, especially during periods of market stress. We continue to recommend that suitable investors consider keeping a bond portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates below that of the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index by emphasizing short to intermediate maturity bonds, but do not believe it\u2019s time to pile into very short maturities despite the 10-year Treasury yield sitting at historically low levels.\n\n*****\n\n# U.S. Jobs Growth Marches On\n\n&gt; While stock markets continue to be extremely volatile as they come to terms with how the coronavirus may affect global growth, the U.S. job market has remained remarkably robust. Continued U.S. jobs data resilience in the face of headwinds from the coronavirus outbreak may be a key factor in prolonging the expansion, given how important the strength of the U.S. consumer has been late into this expansion.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Department of Labor today reported that U.S. nonfarm payroll data had a strong showing of 273,000 jobs added in February, topping the expectation of every Bloomberg-surveyed economist, with an additional upward revision of 85,000 additional jobs for December 2019 and January 2020. This has brought the current unemployment rate back to its 50-year low of 3.5%. So far, it appears it\u2019s too soon for any effects of the coronavirus to have been felt in the jobs numbers. (Note: The survey takes place in the middle of each month.)\n\n&gt; On Wednesday, ADP released its private payroll data (excluding government jobs), which increased by 183,000 in February, also handily beating market expectations. Most of these jobs were added in the service sector, with 44,000 added in the leisure and hospitality sector, and another 31,000 in trade/transportation/utilities. Both of these areas could be at risk of potential cutbacks if consumers start to avoid eating out or other leisure pursuits due to coronavirus fears.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, payrolls remain strong, and any effects of the virus outbreaks most likely would be felt in coming months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/US-Jobs-Data.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFebruary\u2019s jobs report shows the 113th straight month that the U.S. jobs market has grown,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s an incredible run and highlights how the U.S. consumer has become key to extending the expansion, especially given setbacks to global growth from the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d\n\n&gt; While there is bound to be some drag on future jobs data from the coronavirus-related slowdown, we would anticipate that the effects of this may be transitory. We believe economic fundamentals continue to suggest the possibility of a second-half-of-the\u2013year economic rebound.\n\n*****\n\n# Down January &amp; Down February: S&amp;P 500 Posts Full-Year Gain Just 43.75% of Time\n\n&gt; The combination of a down January and a down February has come about 17 times, including this year, going back to 1950. Rest of the year and full-year performance has taken a rather sizable hit following the previous 16 occurrences. March through December S&amp;P 500 average performance drops to 2.32% compared to 7.69% in all years. Full-year performance is even worse with S&amp;P 500 average turning to a loss of 4.91% compared to an average gain of 9.14% in all years. All hope for 2020 is not lost as seven of the 16 past down January and down February years did go on to log gains over the last 10 months and full year while six enjoyed double-digit gains from March to December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/781e034df22d242349ff3f8882653cec/b4f07d98317a2635-4d/s500x750/0ea61b1c01085e74593633995acba59fe8a96ce8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Take Caution After Emergency Rate Cut\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s big rally was an encouraging sign that the markets are becoming more comfortable with the public health, monetary and political handling of the situation. But the history of these \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201csurprise\u201d rate cuts by the Fed between meetings suggest some caution remains in order.\n\n&gt; The table here shows that these surprise cuts between meetings have really only \u201cworked\u201d once in the past 20+ years. In 1998 when the Fed and the plunge protection team acted swiftly and in a coordinated manner to stave off the fallout from the financial crisis caused by the collapse of the Russian ruble and the highly leveraged Long Term Capital Management hedge fund markets responded well. This was not the case during the extended bear markets of 2001-2002 and 2007-2009.\n\n&gt; Bottom line: if this is a short-term impact like the 1998 financial crisis the market should recover sooner rather than later. But if the economic impact of coronavirus virus is prolonged, the market is more likely to languish.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd9ae8723eaf077f8baa56e384c8d8f7/e543b6eee32cdf93-81/s500x750/0f2b63108953c1e4cfb97da0a979d4ab3651cdeb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$DKS**\n&gt; * **$AVGO** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$WORK** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$DOCU** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$CLDR** \n&gt; * **$INSG** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$BTAI** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$HEAR** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$ADDYY** \n&gt; * **$GPS** \n&gt; * **$AKBA** \n&gt; * **$PDD** \n&gt; * **$CYOU** \n&gt; * **$FNV** \n&gt; * **$MTNB** \n&gt; * **$NERV** \n&gt; * **$MTN** \n&gt; * **$BEST** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$NINE** \n&gt; * **$AZUL** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$PRPL** \n&gt; * **$VSLR** \n&gt; * **$KLZE** \n&gt; * **$ZUO** \n&gt; * **$DVAX** \n&gt; * **$EXPR** \n&gt; * **$VRA** \n&gt; * **$AXSM** \n&gt; * **$CDMO** \n&gt; * **$CASY**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MY5URDI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Fq1ixYG.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3QxCDMd.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/kG5Cja7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWb2ADY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SH8bsTn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PH2Inly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RToRF8p.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HECD2g3.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvEJ9Vw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $336.77\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.
