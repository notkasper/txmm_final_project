More data in the coming week may reveal how the housing market fared in April, after the economy abruptly fell off a cliff when states shut down their economies in the second half of March.\n*****\n&gt; Investors\u2019 focus will also be on the government stimulus programs to help the economy and markets get through the coronavirus crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appear before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, as it reviews the government\u2019s trillions in spending to help the economy, businesses and individuals. An interview with Powell will also air on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday night.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season is winding down but there are a number of reports from major retailers, like Walmart and Target, which should show that the big box stores and discounters are making out better than other retailers as consumers halted many discretionary purchases and moved more shopping online.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down nearly 2.3%, in its worst week since March 20. The S&amp;P ended at 2,863. The Dow was off about 2.6% for the week, in its worst week since April 3. It finished the week at 23,598. The Nasdaq also had its worst week since April 3.\n*****\n&gt; # Home sweet home\n&gt; \u201cHousing is going to be important in that you\u2019ll see the chilling effect that Covid has had on housing as well, less on construction than on sales, but on both,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chef economist at Grant Thornton. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be an issue. One of the key things we\u2019re watching going forward is the credit market and housing. There\u2019s been a real tightening of credit because of the servicers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said the mortgage servicers are caught in the middle between the banks and people who aren\u2019t making their payments. She said it has been impacting lending. \u201cThat\u2019s something we cannot afford. Housing was on a tear before, and it has to pull us out of this,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales were down 16.4% in April, and there was an unevenness of performance across the sector. The only positive category was online shopping, up 8.4%. Clothing and accessories, the types of things department stores sell, fell by 78.8% in April. Building materials and garden equipment were down just 3.5%, and that could help Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s which report earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarket reactions to the data have been somewhat muted,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. He said stocks on Friday were reacting negatively to threats from China that U.S. companies could be targeted if the U.S. does not ease up on Huawei. \u201cThe markets right now don\u2019t need another reason to be pessimistic. It seems like both the bond market and stock market are getting a little tired. Both markets are looking for the next catalyst.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Solvency concerns\n&gt; The Fed has been given generally high marks for keeping markets liquid, but analysts say they are now more worried about the solvency of companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting kind of threshold here as we\u2019re approaching three months stay at homes or shelter in place. We\u2019re moving from a liquidity challenge, which the Fed helped us address, to a solvency challenge,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief market strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said unpaid bills start to pile up and default rates rise on credit cards and mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe longer this goes on, the harder for folks to make those payments. That\u2019s why states are eager to open even if it has some risks,\u201d Arone said.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed on Friday said the pandemic poses severe risks to businesses of all sizes and millions of households. It said there could be a sharp rise in defaults as households struggle to pay bills.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the Federal Reserve has removed worries about liquidity with its facilities and asset purchases. \u201cThe reality is the solvency issue which is the bigger focus of the economy and they go hand in hand with the employment issues as things that have to be addressed at some point,\u201d he said. \u201cLook out over the next two months, the solvency issues are based on how the economy reopens and how that medical progress looks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the Fed\u2019s corporate bond program has helped companies refinance and clean up their balance sheet so if insolvencies become a big problem it would not be until next year. He said how the economy reopens over the next few months will determine what happens.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe numbers are out in front of us. We do believe based on what we\u2019re seeing so far, this is the trough of every reading we\u2019re seeing. We do believe things are going to get better. We don\u2019t have reason to believe that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the reopenings would be graded as a \u2018B\u2019 of \u2018B+\u2019 based on how they appear to be going so far, including the infection rates. Nearly all states have resumed some level of activity.\n*****\n&gt; But the market will continue to be choppy until there is more medical progress, such as a vaccine. In a sense, the market depends on science more than ever, Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf all of a sudden, we have a commercially viable vaccine in the first half of next year that\u2019s going to be injected into peoples\u2019 arms prior to, or well before the fall of 2021, then I do think you could make the argument the market is potentially going to hit new all time highs,\u201d Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; # Range bound\n&gt; For now though, he sees the market as range bound, and the S&amp;P 500 is currently about in the middle of it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe have been very adamant about the definition of this market as being neither bull nor bear. It\u2019s bounded by the 200-day moving average on the top, which is basically 3,000 and the 200-week moving average on the bottom which is 2,667 right now,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Arone agrees stocks are going to be choppy, and could react to friction. He said one source of friction is the disagreement over state reopenings, between people who want to see a reopening and those that fear a new outbreak. He said there is also friction between Republicans and Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think until we get clarity that the economy is open and without incident and some of these economic numbers are improving, I think the market is going to remain choppy,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said it makes sense for the market to remain in a sideways range while different issues are resolved.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn a valuation basis, the market is expensive but it\u2019s not so expensive if you assume this economic period is going to be over in a couple of quarters,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cIf you return to growth in the third and fourth quarter which we don\u2019t necessarily know if that\u2019s going to be robust, but we expect it to be better next year.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said he expects a recovery to be more shaped like a bathtub, than like a V or a U, meaning it would be elongated on the bottom before an upturn.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPart of what actually supports the market is this abject negativity. When everyone is already pessimistic the presumption is they\u2019ve already done a lot of their selling so there isn\u2019t a ton of fuel for the downside there,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zvpr3QV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AG078t9.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/rZdWJAt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yC4IyAc.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HovLnbP.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hgJTyte.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iPw8MFr.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QBgwc4P.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SUxpLyG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QmygShJ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9XPyDjX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1vFPlrt.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/joZmmeD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retail Sales Telling the Economy\u2019s Story\n\n&gt; Retail sales numbers for April were released today, and the basic story was no surprise. Retail sales fell a record 16.4% in April, after declining 8.4% in March, already the largest decline since the government started keeping records in 1992.\n\n&gt; The year-over-year decline of more than -21.6% has already topped the -11.5% seen during depths of the financial crisis, as shown in the accompanying chart. But there are hints that the decline has been heavily influenced by store closures rather than shoppers tightening their belts, and that might bode well for the future as the economy gradually starts to open up.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.15.20-Retail-Sales-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cOne of the reasons for the major decline in retail sales is simply because many businesses are closed,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cAs the economy slowly opens back up, retail sales should bounce back, as pent-up demand is there\u201d\n\n&gt; For the past two months, the economy experienced an 89% decline in apparel sales and a 59.2% decline in restaurant sales. These numbers capture the effects of businesses closing. The one area of the retail sales numbers that has done relatively well? Groceries had a record April as consumers stocked up and continued to show some strength in May.\n\n&gt; While it will take time for retail sales to get back to normal, several factors are in play that should help support retail activity as the economy opens up. Pent-up demand is increasingly evident. Fiscal stimulus should help preserve incomes. And consumer balance sheets remain relatively healthy, with credit card debt declining the most in decades in March. While weakness will continue, April data may be the low point for retail sales, with good prospects for some strength in the second half of the year. A return to full strength will ultimately depend on the progress doctors and scientists make in limiting the dangers from COVID-19, but even the gradual opening up of the economy may show retail sales numbers starting to stabilize as early as next month.\n\n*****\n\n# How Expensive Are Stocks Right Now?\n\n&gt; As stocks rallied 30% off the March 23 lows and earnings expectations were cut dramatically, valuations have become increasingly concerning for many investors (including some high-profile hedge fund managers being quoted in the financial press).\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the forward (next 12 months) price-to-earnings (PE) multiple for the S&amp;P 500 Index recently eclipsed 20, which is overvalued based on historical averages and at the highest level since the tech bubble in the late 1990s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.14.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While stocks look expensive on this metric\u2014one of the reasons why we expect a correction of perhaps 10% from the April 29 highs\u2014valuations may be getting too much attention.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks look overvalued based on earnings estimates for the next year, which will probably fall further,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile the return to 2019\u2019s earnings levels may still be two years or more off, the potential for steady improvement and low interest rates suggest they may not be as stretched as they appear.\u201d\n\n&gt; So how worried should investors be? Here are three reasons not to worry too much:\n\n&gt; * Earnings will eventually come back. This recession has an end date, and eventually we\u2019ll beat this virus. So while earnings will take time to reach last year\u2019s levels, they should steadily improve starting next quarter. A vaccine could accelerate the timetable.\n&gt; * Interest rates and inflation are low. A 20 PE with a sub-1% yield on the 10-year Treasury without a whiff of inflation on the horizon is not unreasonable. And Federal Reserve support isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. In such a low-rate environment, the opportunity cost of waiting an extra year for earnings to come through is not high. Most of a stock\u2019s value is derived from the earnings the company could generate in year two and beyond.\n&gt; * Valuations are not good short-term timing tools. There is essentially no statistical relationship between PE ratios and subsequent one-year performance for the stock market. Although we expect more volatility as the path of the economy and corporate profits becomes clearer, we also expect stocks to grow into their valuations as earnings likely recover next year.\n\n&gt; Stocks are expensive on traditional PE metrics, and a correction would not surprise us. But given the environment we\u2019re in, valuations are not as worrisome as they may appear. The potential for a steady recovery in earnings over the next couple of years with low interest rates suggests that some of the valuation fears may be exaggerated.\n\n*****\n\n# Why Gold Will Continue To Shine\n\n&gt; Gold has done quite well so far in 2020, up more than 12% year to date versus the S&amp;P 500 Index which is down about 10%. We started to warm to the yellow metal late last year and continue to think it can serve as a potential hedge in a well-diversified portfolio for suitable investors.\n\n&gt; \u201cFrom COVID-19, to massive monetary stimulus, to historically lower yields, to potentially negative fed funds rates down the road, there are many reasons to think gold could continue its recent strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold based for years before breaking out last year. This is a strong chart from a technical perspective and eventual new highs over the coming years could be quite likely.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.13.20-gold-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retest Possible, But Bottom Likely In as Jobless Claims Trend Lower\n\n&gt; Initial Weekly Jobless Claims of 3.3 million, 6.9 million, 6.6 million, 5.2 million, 4.4 million, 3.8 million, 3.2 million and 3.0 million the past eight weeks, totaling 36.5 million, is astonishing. The good news is the trend is lower and as we pointed out in mid-April four weeks ago a spike peak in Initial Claims and an immediate precipitous retreat has been an effective indication of a bear market low over the years.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s chart, presented above, is from the FRED database hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis compares the recent history of Jobless claims with the Wilshire 5000. (Gaps in the Wilshire index line are market holidays.) Clearly, the March 23 low and the spike high in Claims at the end of that week correlate quite well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4e19557c405d330902008fffb0a44c9/6eb13090bbcbbb54-1c/s500x750/43d5f31c2ba69a27a6253c19a4e3323b55287794.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Sentiment Unexpectedly Improves\n\n&gt; The preliminary read on sentiment from the University of Michigan was a surprising bright spot in Friday's weak economic data as the headline reading improved from 71.8 up to 73.7 versus expectations for a decline to 68.0. Even with this increase, sentiment remains near a 10-year low, so it's not as though investors are actually positive, they're just less negative. While the increase in sentiment was a bit of a surprise, it makes sense. April was a month where the economy was essentially shut down, so the impact of that sudden stop on sentiment was intense. However, now that things have started to thaw a little bit, you can't fault people for becoming more optimistic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH.png))**\n\n&gt; While consumers are feeling a bit better about the way things are, they are still extremely uneasy about the future. The chart below breaks down sentiment towards current conditions and expectations about the future. While the current conditions component showed some improvement, the expectations component saw further declines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH-C-vs-E.png))**\n\n&gt; One question in the monthly survey that caused us to do a double-take was the question that asks, \"During the last few months, have you heard of any favorable or unfavorable changes in business conditions? And what did you hear?\" In this month's survey, the index that tracks instances of unfavorable news mentions hit a record high of 141. This series goes all the way back to 1959, and never before has it been near current levels. The prior high for this index was back in the depths of the financial crisis when the index peaked at 133. There hasn't been much good news lately, but even this reading is extreme.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-News.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Remain On Guard\n\n&gt; In a post earlier today, we noted that individual investors still remain overwhelmingly bearish despite the equity market's rally off the March lows. Another sentiment indicator released by TD Ameritrade supports this view that investors aren't particularly bullish right now. The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors\u2019 portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.\n\n&gt; The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index has been in existence since 2010, and in that entire history there have only been five months where the index was weaker than it is now, and that was from October 2011 through February 2012. That was also a period that marked a major low in the equity market and was followed by a nearly uninterrupted three-year rally in the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; While the Investor Movement Index is near record lows right now, it has been weak for some time, and that weakness came even as the S&amp;P 500 was climbing to record highs over the last 12-18 months. In other words, while investors are just about as cautious as they have been at any time in the last ten years, this conservatism is nothing new.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051420-Investor-Movement-Index.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$NAT** \n&gt; * **$TGT** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$SE** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$BJ** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$TTWO** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$OAS** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$MCK** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$INSE** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$FL** \n&gt; * **$DNR** \n&gt; * **$EXPE** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$CBL** \n&gt; * **$DE** \n&gt; * **$KMDA** \n&gt; * **$SPLK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$EXP** \n&gt; * **$WB** \n&gt; * **$NIU** \n&gt; * **$HZN** \n&gt; * **$TNK** \n&gt; * **$TRVG** \n&gt; * **$IGT** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$OMP** \n&gt; * **$URBN** \n&gt; * **$SNPS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/SUxpLyG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QfbW3wN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/HmyOo14.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.18.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AyHFMTJ.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5ZcrgPO.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.19.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DWLvaBT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ClIq9Ts.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7SQEwiM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vhjzEL1.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.21.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oJLC8tG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UVcv4sk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IsY2N2x.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.22.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Walmart Inc. $125.94\n&gt; **Walmart Inc.

More data in the coming week may reveal how the housing market fared in April, after the economy abruptly fell off a cliff when states shut down their economies in the second half of March.\n*****\n&gt; Investors\u2019 focus will also be on the government stimulus programs to help the economy and markets get through the coronavirus crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appear before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, as it reviews the government\u2019s trillions in spending to help the economy, businesses and individuals. An interview with Powell will also air on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday night.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season is winding down but there are a number of reports from major retailers, like Walmart and Target, which should show that the big box stores and discounters are making out better than other retailers as consumers halted many discretionary purchases and moved more shopping online.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down nearly 2.3%, in its worst week since March 20. The S&amp;P ended at 2,863. The Dow was off about 2.6% for the week, in its worst week since April 3. It finished the week at 23,598. The Nasdaq also had its worst week since April 3.\n*****\n&gt; # Home sweet home\n&gt; \u201cHousing is going to be important in that you\u2019ll see the chilling effect that Covid has had on housing as well, less on construction than on sales, but on both,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chef economist at Grant Thornton. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be an issue. One of the key things we\u2019re watching going forward is the credit market and housing. There\u2019s been a real tightening of credit because of the servicers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said the mortgage servicers are caught in the middle between the banks and people who aren\u2019t making their payments. She said it has been impacting lending. \u201cThat\u2019s something we cannot afford. Housing was on a tear before, and it has to pull us out of this,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales were down 16.4% in April, and there was an unevenness of performance across the sector. The only positive category was online shopping, up 8.4%. Clothing and accessories, the types of things department stores sell, fell by 78.8% in April. Building materials and garden equipment were down just 3.5%, and that could help Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s which report earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarket reactions to the data have been somewhat muted,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. He said stocks on Friday were reacting negatively to threats from China that U.S. companies could be targeted if the U.S. does not ease up on Huawei. \u201cThe markets right now don\u2019t need another reason to be pessimistic. It seems like both the bond market and stock market are getting a little tired. Both markets are looking for the next catalyst.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Solvency concerns\n&gt; The Fed has been given generally high marks for keeping markets liquid, but analysts say they are now more worried about the solvency of companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting kind of threshold here as we\u2019re approaching three months stay at homes or shelter in place. We\u2019re moving from a liquidity challenge, which the Fed helped us address, to a solvency challenge,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief market strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said unpaid bills start to pile up and default rates rise on credit cards and mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe longer this goes on, the harder for folks to make those payments. That\u2019s why states are eager to open even if it has some risks,\u201d Arone said.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed on Friday said the pandemic poses severe risks to businesses of all sizes and millions of households. It said there could be a sharp rise in defaults as households struggle to pay bills.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the Federal Reserve has removed worries about liquidity with its facilities and asset purchases. \u201cThe reality is the solvency issue which is the bigger focus of the economy and they go hand in hand with the employment issues as things that have to be addressed at some point,\u201d he said. \u201cLook out over the next two months, the solvency issues are based on how the economy reopens and how that medical progress looks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the Fed\u2019s corporate bond program has helped companies refinance and clean up their balance sheet so if insolvencies become a big problem it would not be until next year. He said how the economy reopens over the next few months will determine what happens.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe numbers are out in front of us. We do believe based on what we\u2019re seeing so far, this is the trough of every reading we\u2019re seeing. We do believe things are going to get better. We don\u2019t have reason to believe that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the reopenings would be graded as a \u2018B\u2019 of \u2018B+\u2019 based on how they appear to be going so far, including the infection rates. Nearly all states have resumed some level of activity.\n*****\n&gt; But the market will continue to be choppy until there is more medical progress, such as a vaccine. In a sense, the market depends on science more than ever, Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf all of a sudden, we have a commercially viable vaccine in the first half of next year that\u2019s going to be injected into peoples\u2019 arms prior to, or well before the fall of 2021, then I do think you could make the argument the market is potentially going to hit new all time highs,\u201d Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; # Range bound\n&gt; For now though, he sees the market as range bound, and the S&amp;P 500 is currently about in the middle of it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe have been very adamant about the definition of this market as being neither bull nor bear. It\u2019s bounded by the 200-day moving average on the top, which is basically 3,000 and the 200-week moving average on the bottom which is 2,667 right now,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Arone agrees stocks are going to be choppy, and could react to friction. He said one source of friction is the disagreement over state reopenings, between people who want to see a reopening and those that fear a new outbreak. He said there is also friction between Republicans and Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think until we get clarity that the economy is open and without incident and some of these economic numbers are improving, I think the market is going to remain choppy,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said it makes sense for the market to remain in a sideways range while different issues are resolved.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn a valuation basis, the market is expensive but it\u2019s not so expensive if you assume this economic period is going to be over in a couple of quarters,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cIf you return to growth in the third and fourth quarter which we don\u2019t necessarily know if that\u2019s going to be robust, but we expect it to be better next year.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said he expects a recovery to be more shaped like a bathtub, than like a V or a U, meaning it would be elongated on the bottom before an upturn.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPart of what actually supports the market is this abject negativity. When everyone is already pessimistic the presumption is they\u2019ve already done a lot of their selling so there isn\u2019t a ton of fuel for the downside there,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zvpr3QV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AG078t9.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/rZdWJAt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yC4IyAc.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HovLnbP.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hgJTyte.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iPw8MFr.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QBgwc4P.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SUxpLyG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QmygShJ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9XPyDjX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1vFPlrt.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/joZmmeD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retail Sales Telling the Economy\u2019s Story\n\n&gt; Retail sales numbers for April were released today, and the basic story was no surprise. Retail sales fell a record 16.4% in April, after declining 8.4% in March, already the largest decline since the government started keeping records in 1992.\n\n&gt; The year-over-year decline of more than -21.6% has already topped the -11.5% seen during depths of the financial crisis, as shown in the accompanying chart. But there are hints that the decline has been heavily influenced by store closures rather than shoppers tightening their belts, and that might bode well for the future as the economy gradually starts to open up.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.15.20-Retail-Sales-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cOne of the reasons for the major decline in retail sales is simply because many businesses are closed,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cAs the economy slowly opens back up, retail sales should bounce back, as pent-up demand is there\u201d\n\n&gt; For the past two months, the economy experienced an 89% decline in apparel sales and a 59.2% decline in restaurant sales. These numbers capture the effects of businesses closing. The one area of the retail sales numbers that has done relatively well? Groceries had a record April as consumers stocked up and continued to show some strength in May.\n\n&gt; While it will take time for retail sales to get back to normal, several factors are in play that should help support retail activity as the economy opens up. Pent-up demand is increasingly evident. Fiscal stimulus should help preserve incomes. And consumer balance sheets remain relatively healthy, with credit card debt declining the most in decades in March. While weakness will continue, April data may be the low point for retail sales, with good prospects for some strength in the second half of the year. A return to full strength will ultimately depend on the progress doctors and scientists make in limiting the dangers from COVID-19, but even the gradual opening up of the economy may show retail sales numbers starting to stabilize as early as next month.\n\n*****\n\n# How Expensive Are Stocks Right Now?\n\n&gt; As stocks rallied 30% off the March 23 lows and earnings expectations were cut dramatically, valuations have become increasingly concerning for many investors (including some high-profile hedge fund managers being quoted in the financial press).\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the forward (next 12 months) price-to-earnings (PE) multiple for the S&amp;P 500 Index recently eclipsed 20, which is overvalued based on historical averages and at the highest level since the tech bubble in the late 1990s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.14.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While stocks look expensive on this metric\u2014one of the reasons why we expect a correction of perhaps 10% from the April 29 highs\u2014valuations may be getting too much attention.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks look overvalued based on earnings estimates for the next year, which will probably fall further,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile the return to 2019\u2019s earnings levels may still be two years or more off, the potential for steady improvement and low interest rates suggest they may not be as stretched as they appear.\u201d\n\n&gt; So how worried should investors be? Here are three reasons not to worry too much:\n\n&gt; * Earnings will eventually come back. This recession has an end date, and eventually we\u2019ll beat this virus. So while earnings will take time to reach last year\u2019s levels, they should steadily improve starting next quarter. A vaccine could accelerate the timetable.\n&gt; * Interest rates and inflation are low. A 20 PE with a sub-1% yield on the 10-year Treasury without a whiff of inflation on the horizon is not unreasonable. And Federal Reserve support isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. In such a low-rate environment, the opportunity cost of waiting an extra year for earnings to come through is not high. Most of a stock\u2019s value is derived from the earnings the company could generate in year two and beyond.\n&gt; * Valuations are not good short-term timing tools. There is essentially no statistical relationship between PE ratios and subsequent one-year performance for the stock market. Although we expect more volatility as the path of the economy and corporate profits becomes clearer, we also expect stocks to grow into their valuations as earnings likely recover next year.\n\n&gt; Stocks are expensive on traditional PE metrics, and a correction would not surprise us. But given the environment we\u2019re in, valuations are not as worrisome as they may appear. The potential for a steady recovery in earnings over the next couple of years with low interest rates suggests that some of the valuation fears may be exaggerated.\n\n*****\n\n# Why Gold Will Continue To Shine\n\n&gt; Gold has done quite well so far in 2020, up more than 12% year to date versus the S&amp;P 500 Index which is down about 10%. We started to warm to the yellow metal late last year and continue to think it can serve as a potential hedge in a well-diversified portfolio for suitable investors.\n\n&gt; \u201cFrom COVID-19, to massive monetary stimulus, to historically lower yields, to potentially negative fed funds rates down the road, there are many reasons to think gold could continue its recent strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold based for years before breaking out last year. This is a strong chart from a technical perspective and eventual new highs over the coming years could be quite likely.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.13.20-gold-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retest Possible, But Bottom Likely In as Jobless Claims Trend Lower\n\n&gt; Initial Weekly Jobless Claims of 3.3 million, 6.9 million, 6.6 million, 5.2 million, 4.4 million, 3.8 million, 3.2 million and 3.0 million the past eight weeks, totaling 36.5 million, is astonishing. The good news is the trend is lower and as we pointed out in mid-April four weeks ago a spike peak in Initial Claims and an immediate precipitous retreat has been an effective indication of a bear market low over the years.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s chart, presented above, is from the FRED database hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis compares the recent history of Jobless claims with the Wilshire 5000. (Gaps in the Wilshire index line are market holidays.) Clearly, the March 23 low and the spike high in Claims at the end of that week correlate quite well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4e19557c405d330902008fffb0a44c9/6eb13090bbcbbb54-1c/s500x750/43d5f31c2ba69a27a6253c19a4e3323b55287794.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Sentiment Unexpectedly Improves\n\n&gt; The preliminary read on sentiment from the University of Michigan was a surprising bright spot in Friday's weak economic data as the headline reading improved from 71.8 up to 73.7 versus expectations for a decline to 68.0. Even with this increase, sentiment remains near a 10-year low, so it's not as though investors are actually positive, they're just less negative. While the increase in sentiment was a bit of a surprise, it makes sense. April was a month where the economy was essentially shut down, so the impact of that sudden stop on sentiment was intense. However, now that things have started to thaw a little bit, you can't fault people for becoming more optimistic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH.png))**\n\n&gt; While consumers are feeling a bit better about the way things are, they are still extremely uneasy about the future. The chart below breaks down sentiment towards current conditions and expectations about the future. While the current conditions component showed some improvement, the expectations component saw further declines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH-C-vs-E.png))**\n\n&gt; One question in the monthly survey that caused us to do a double-take was the question that asks, \"During the last few months, have you heard of any favorable or unfavorable changes in business conditions? And what did you hear?\" In this month's survey, the index that tracks instances of unfavorable news mentions hit a record high of 141. This series goes all the way back to 1959, and never before has it been near current levels. The prior high for this index was back in the depths of the financial crisis when the index peaked at 133. There hasn't been much good news lately, but even this reading is extreme.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-News.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Remain On Guard\n\n&gt; In a post earlier today, we noted that individual investors still remain overwhelmingly bearish despite the equity market's rally off the March lows. Another sentiment indicator released by TD Ameritrade supports this view that investors aren't particularly bullish right now. The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors\u2019 portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.\n\n&gt; The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index has been in existence since 2010, and in that entire history there have only been five months where the index was weaker than it is now, and that was from October 2011 through February 2012. That was also a period that marked a major low in the equity market and was followed by a nearly uninterrupted three-year rally in the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; While the Investor Movement Index is near record lows right now, it has been weak for some time, and that weakness came even as the S&amp;P 500 was climbing to record highs over the last 12-18 months. In other words, while investors are just about as cautious as they have been at any time in the last ten years, this conservatism is nothing new.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051420-Investor-Movement-Index.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$NAT** \n&gt; * **$TGT** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$SE** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$BJ** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$TTWO** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$OAS** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$MCK** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$INSE** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$FL** \n&gt; * **$DNR** \n&gt; * **$EXPE** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$CBL** \n&gt; * **$DE** \n&gt; * **$KMDA** \n&gt; * **$SPLK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$EXP** \n&gt; * **$WB** \n&gt; * **$NIU** \n&gt; * **$HZN** \n&gt; * **$TNK** \n&gt; * **$TRVG** \n&gt; * **$IGT** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$OMP** \n&gt; * **$URBN** \n&gt; * **$SNPS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/SUxpLyG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QfbW3wN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/HmyOo14.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.18.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AyHFMTJ.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5ZcrgPO.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.19.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DWLvaBT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ClIq9Ts.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7SQEwiM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vhjzEL1.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.21.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oJLC8tG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UVcv4sk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IsY2N2x.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.22.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Walmart Inc. $125.94\n&gt; **Walmart Inc.

The U.S. economy is not expected to take a big hit, but the question for the stock market is how will corporate earnings be impacted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt does feel as though the market thinks the worst is over,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe pace of change is slowing. None of us really know, and there\u2019s a lot of skepticism, including in Washington that they can\u2019t believe what\u2019s coming out of China.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Keon believes the market looks poised to head higher and it is trading as if the virus will not make a big dent in the economy or profits. \u201cThe market didn\u2019t really get much of a drawback, compared to SARS or other episodes. There\u2019s no doubt he world will suffer a hit over the first and second quarter and maybe longer,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Companies reporting earnings in the coming week include Walmart Tuesday; ViacomCBS Thursday, and Deere on Friday. Hyatt Hotels reports Wednesday, and Norwegian Cruise Lines reports Thursday. Economic releases include Tuesday\u2019s Empire State and Thursday\u2019s Philadelphia Fed manufacturing surveys, as well as Markit PMI on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; There are also a parade of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.\n*****\n&gt; # Profit warnings\n&gt; Some companies are already raising warnings, like Cisco which said orders were down and that the forward-looking numbers were not factoring in potential supply chain disruptions. Nvidia said it would take a $100 million hit from the virus, but its revenue forecast was still above expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Under Armour said its sales will be impacted by the virus, when it projected disappointing revenue growth this week. Estee Lauder said its sales will be hit by a decline in travel-related luxury sales.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is going to start to show up because it will affect supply chains\u201d and exporters, said Keon. \u201cIt will have a negative impact. But at the moment, at least, it doesn\u2019t look like it will be a huge deal to companies in the U.S...It will be a factor. The question is, is it a lasting factor that will hurt them through the year, or is it a quarter or two and then gets back to normal. None of us know.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 64,000 people, mostly in China, have been infected and about 1,400 have died from the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research, said he sees only a minor impact on U.S. corporate earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere will be some hits in some of the consumer companies that have reasonably big businesses in China. I see this as being a fairly small effect on the U.S.,\u201d Knapp said. He said the disruption to the supply chain should not be nearly as bad as it was when Japan was hit by a tsunami and earthquake in 2011.\n*****\n&gt; He expects stocks to continue to move higher, ending the year higher, but he says the market could run into turbulence in the spring when the Fed discusses cutting back its purchases of Treasury bills.\n*****\n&gt; For now, the Fed asset purchases, a strong U.S. consumer and the positive benefit to business spending from the trade deal should help drive stocks higher. But by April or May, the Fed could become a negative. \u201cCould we go up another 3 or 4% between now and then? Sure, we could,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said since World War II, market corrections fanned by Fed policy changes have resulted in brief pullbacks, averaging about 8%. He said the market should then rebound. \u201cIt trades in a range for a quarter or two and then resumes its uptrend,\u201d he said, noting the uptrend could coincide with the presidential election this year.\n*****\n&gt; # Resilient market\n&gt; Even with the negative news and doubts about the virus, analysts say the market has the momentum to move higher. But Robert Sluymer, technical analyst with Fundstrat, said the market may stay range bound for awhile until there\u2019s more clarity on the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI had a 3,340 to 3,360 [on the S&amp;P 500] as the point where the market starts to consolidate, and we\u2019re there,\u201d said Sluymer. \u201cI don\u2019t have a year-end target but I think it\u2019s higher. I think we\u2019re in a sloppy range. I think it\u2019s range bound.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Sluymer also said he thinks the market is just pausing. \u201cStocks are consolidating above support. The market is acting incredibly resilient and it still looks like an intermediate term pause, a consolidation,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said he\u2019s looking for more gains though the market will continue to be swung by virus-related headlines. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to work its way higher, not at the pace you saw last year.

But stocks have taken off in February, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 4% this month, as US economic data remains strong and fears over the worst-case scenarios for the coronavirus appear overblown.\n\n&gt; Historically, February has been a month when stocks tend to take a bit of a break. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has been flat, on average, during the second month of an election year. What is most interesting, though, is how weak October has been historically leading up to presidential elections, yet how strong stocks have been in November and December as political uncertainty clears following elections.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SP-500-index-average-monthly-returns-during-an-election-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Maybe the big gains so far this month shouldn\u2019t be a total surprise? \u201cYes, February historically has been a troublesome month for stocks,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cYet over the past decade, no month has seen better returns.\u201d In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 2.34% on average in February over the past decade, compared with the second best month of October\u2019s gain of 2.29%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/february-is-usually-weak-but-has-been-the-best-month-the-past-10-years.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Record Pace of Records\n\n&gt; Let's preface this with the fact that it's still early in the year and the rest of the year is unlikely to closely follow the path we have seen so far, but the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace for its 11th record closing high this year. While we're just 29 trading days into the year, in the post-WWII period, 2020 already ranks as the 33rd highest number of record closing highs for the S&amp;P 500 in a given year (out of 76). What's even more notable, though, is that at the current pace the S&amp;P 500 would have 96 record closes this year, which would dwarf the total from every other year. For reference, the highest number of record closing highs in a given year was 77 in 1995, and there are only four other years (1961, 1964, 2014, and 2017) where there were more than 50 record closes.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Continues to Gain Share of World Market Cap\n\n&gt; The United States dominates the rest of the world in terms of its share of total equity market capitalization. Currently, US stocks make up over 40% of global equities' total market cap. No other country comes even close to this size with the next largest country being China with just 8.47% and then Japan with 7.09%. Hong Kong is the only other individual county with a share larger than 5%. While France is the largest European Union country stock market in terms of the percentage of world market cap at only 3%, the total share of all EU countries shown sits at over 10%. Former EU member, the United Kingdon, is also one of the larger countries but has consistently lost share over the past decade. So far this year it has lost another 0.2%.\n\n&gt; One interesting change that we noted at the end of last year has been the massive increase in Saudi Arabia's share thanks to one of the world's largest companies, Saudi Aramco, hitting public markets. Although it has led to a massive jump over the long run, since the start of the year Saudi Arabia's share of market cap has fallen 14 bps likely due to Saudi Aramco being a one-way trade lower off of its highs that were put in place only a few days after its IPO. Meanwhile, the US has taken another 1.17% of the world's market cap in 2020 alone.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/World-Market-Cap2.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are several individual countries that are actually outperforming the US so far in 2020, generally speaking, the US has outperformed the rest of the world which is why the US has taken more market cap this year. Whereas the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.93% YTD as of yesterday's close, MSCI's World Index excluding the US is just about flat. That trend of US outperformance has been in place for much of the past year well before the coronavirus hit Asia in December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RS-ROW.png))**\n\n&gt; Another interesting country to note is China. 2020 has been off to a rocky start thanks to the coronavirus. This had sent the country's share of global market cap plummeting down to ~8% on February 3rd. That was its lowest level since February of last year. But as this month has progressed and the situation surrounding the virus has improved, China has regained some of those losses and is now sitting with a larger share of world market cap than it ended 2019 with.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/China-Percent.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Things Are Looking Up\n\n&gt; Stocks had their best week in 8 months last week, as the worst of the coronavirus fears subsided and the US economy showed some impressive resolve. Last, the LPL Strategists discuss why international stocks could finally be close to having their time in the sun after lagging the US for much of the past decade.\n\n&gt; # DEVELOPED MARKETS ARE LOOKING BETTER\n&gt; Developed markets have lagged the US for more than 10 years now. Although we aren\u2019t ready to fully invest in these areas, we are starting to see signs to warm up to international equites. As the LPL Strategists discuss, values are historically cheap relative to the US, global growth is stabilizing, growth leadership my start to weaken, and the US dollar should be pressured lower. Should any of those four reasons begin to take place, it could create a nice tailwind for international stocks.\n\n&gt; # THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS\n&gt; Equity markets bounced nicely last week, as fears over the coronavirus appear to be calming. The loss of lives is devastating, but markets are focusing on this fast spreading, yet low death rate of this virus versus other dangerous outbreaks. The LPL Strategists noted that China could very well see flat GDP growth in Q1, a big pick up later in 2020 could be likely. Additionally, don\u2019t forget that the US economy actually got stronger during the SARS outbreak in 2003.\n\n&gt; # SOME MORE GOOD NEWS\n&gt; Further supporting stocks last week was a trio of solid economic data in the US. The jobs report in January showed a very solid 225,000 jobs created, well above expectations. Additionally, much better than expected manufacturing data and solid services data show an economy that continues to defy the naysayers. Last, productivity in Q4 bounced and for the year it was the highest nonfarm productivity since 2010.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/images/Article_Page/WMC_02102020_1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Another \"Delay\" in the Value Trade\n\n&gt; How many times over the last few years have you heard something to the tune of \"The time for value stocks to outperform is now.\" Well, we're still waiting. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Value Index versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index going back to 1995. A quick warning: if you have a sensitive stomach you may want to skip the chart altogether.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-Value-vs-Growth.png))**\n\n&gt; From 1995 right up to the bull market peak in 2000, value stocks couldn't catch a break as they steadily underperformed growth stocks. Those were the days when Energy as a sector was 'dead' and investors couldn't get enough of tech IPOs with trendy sounding names. The low for value stocks on a relative basis came on 3/27/00, and from there the reversal was swift. By April of 2001, value stocks had regained nearly all of the ground they lost relative to growth during the late 1990s. Unfortunately for investors in both types of strategies, the outperformance in value wasn't the result of a monster rally, but instead a massive decline in growth stocks.\n\n&gt; From April 2001 through late 2002, value stocks underperformed again as the Worldcom and Enron accounting scandals cast a pall over sectors like Telecom Services and Utilities - two sectors traditionally comprised predominantly by value stocks. As the dust settled on those two scandals, though, and the economy stabilized, value stocks rallied again as Energy, Financials, and Materials stocks boomed.\n\n&gt; As the Financial sector began to unravel in 2007 and oil prices peaked in 2008, value stocks once again cratered relative to growth. Growth has maintained its lead over value ever since. Outside of some periods where value stocks briefly popped and strategist after strategist came out and said this time the rally is for real, growth stocks have left value stocks in the dust. Just last year, the underperformance of value stocks marked a major milestone as they took out their lows in relative strength versus growth stocks. While the S&amp;P 500 Value Index saw a modest bounce towards the end of last year, any momentum it had has quickly been erased in 2020 as the ratio between it and the S&amp;P 500 Growth index is now at fresh lows.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 14th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.16.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$ENPH** \n&gt; * **$INMD** \n&gt; * **$TRU** \n&gt; * **$WAB** \n&gt; * **$AEIS** \n&gt; * **$WING** \n&gt; * **$BHC** \n&gt; * **$VMC** \n&gt; * **$GRMN** \n&gt; * **$LDOS** \n&gt; * **$TSEM** \n&gt; * **$ECL** \n&gt; * **$ALLE** \n&gt; * **$GRPN** \n&gt; * **$CEVA** \n&gt; * **$OLED** \n&gt; * **$DBX** \n&gt; * **$NXRT** \n&gt; * **$BLMN** \n&gt; * **$ATH** \n&gt; * **$WIX** \n&gt; * **$FANG** \n&gt; * **$CEQP** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$FLR** \n&gt; * **$ZS** \n&gt; * **$VG** \n&gt; * **$SIX** \n&gt; * **$A** \n&gt; * **$CHH** \n&gt; * **$SEDG** \n&gt; * **$NVTA** \n&gt; * **$IMAX** \n&gt; * **$AG** \n&gt; * **$EXPD** \n&gt; * **$FSLR** \n&gt; * **$STNG** \n&gt; * **$AKS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/j9w4IR8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/siAY14P.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/kpCRctt.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

The U.S. economy is not expected to take a big hit, but the question for the stock market is how will corporate earnings be impacted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt does feel as though the market thinks the worst is over,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe pace of change is slowing. None of us really know, and there\u2019s a lot of skepticism, including in Washington that they can\u2019t believe what\u2019s coming out of China.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Keon believes the market looks poised to head higher and it is trading as if the virus will not make a big dent in the economy or profits. \u201cThe market didn\u2019t really get much of a drawback, compared to SARS or other episodes. There\u2019s no doubt he world will suffer a hit over the first and second quarter and maybe longer,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Companies reporting earnings in the coming week include Walmart Tuesday; ViacomCBS Thursday, and Deere on Friday. Hyatt Hotels reports Wednesday, and Norwegian Cruise Lines reports Thursday. Economic releases include Tuesday\u2019s Empire State and Thursday\u2019s Philadelphia Fed manufacturing surveys, as well as Markit PMI on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; There are also a parade of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.\n*****\n&gt; # Profit warnings\n&gt; Some companies are already raising warnings, like Cisco which said orders were down and that the forward-looking numbers were not factoring in potential supply chain disruptions. Nvidia said it would take a $100 million hit from the virus, but its revenue forecast was still above expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Under Armour said its sales will be impacted by the virus, when it projected disappointing revenue growth this week. Estee Lauder said its sales will be hit by a decline in travel-related luxury sales.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is going to start to show up because it will affect supply chains\u201d and exporters, said Keon. \u201cIt will have a negative impact. But at the moment, at least, it doesn\u2019t look like it will be a huge deal to companies in the U.S...It will be a factor. The question is, is it a lasting factor that will hurt them through the year, or is it a quarter or two and then gets back to normal. None of us know.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 64,000 people, mostly in China, have been infected and about 1,400 have died from the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research, said he sees only a minor impact on U.S. corporate earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere will be some hits in some of the consumer companies that have reasonably big businesses in China. I see this as being a fairly small effect on the U.S.,\u201d Knapp said. He said the disruption to the supply chain should not be nearly as bad as it was when Japan was hit by a tsunami and earthquake in 2011.\n*****\n&gt; He expects stocks to continue to move higher, ending the year higher, but he says the market could run into turbulence in the spring when the Fed discusses cutting back its purchases of Treasury bills.\n*****\n&gt; For now, the Fed asset purchases, a strong U.S. consumer and the positive benefit to business spending from the trade deal should help drive stocks higher. But by April or May, the Fed could become a negative. \u201cCould we go up another 3 or 4% between now and then? Sure, we could,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said since World War II, market corrections fanned by Fed policy changes have resulted in brief pullbacks, averaging about 8%. He said the market should then rebound. \u201cIt trades in a range for a quarter or two and then resumes its uptrend,\u201d he said, noting the uptrend could coincide with the presidential election this year.\n*****\n&gt; # Resilient market\n&gt; Even with the negative news and doubts about the virus, analysts say the market has the momentum to move higher. But Robert Sluymer, technical analyst with Fundstrat, said the market may stay range bound for awhile until there\u2019s more clarity on the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI had a 3,340 to 3,360 [on the S&amp;P 500] as the point where the market starts to consolidate, and we\u2019re there,\u201d said Sluymer. \u201cI don\u2019t have a year-end target but I think it\u2019s higher. I think we\u2019re in a sloppy range. I think it\u2019s range bound.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Sluymer also said he thinks the market is just pausing. \u201cStocks are consolidating above support. The market is acting incredibly resilient and it still looks like an intermediate term pause, a consolidation,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said he\u2019s looking for more gains though the market will continue to be swung by virus-related headlines. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to work its way higher, not at the pace you saw last year. But that\u2019s the way we have our portfolios positioned \u2014 the market will work its way higher this year,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zGXae0P.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZsVPAZO.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DE2dIMR.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/iGBF28x.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/rMe9946.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ps9FL8g.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C48fTcF.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lJgq8up.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j9w4IR8.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CKn6MfJ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/A3rPbpC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QLBnp9J.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SfzBNHl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# February Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 Up 12 of Last 14\n\n&gt; February\u2019s option expiration day has been down more often than not over the past 26 years with an average loss of 0.20% for S&amp;P 500.

But stocks have taken off in February, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 4% this month, as US economic data remains strong and fears over the worst-case scenarios for the coronavirus appear overblown.\n\n&gt; Historically, February has been a month when stocks tend to take a bit of a break. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has been flat, on average, during the second month of an election year. What is most interesting, though, is how weak October has been historically leading up to presidential elections, yet how strong stocks have been in November and December as political uncertainty clears following elections.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SP-500-index-average-monthly-returns-during-an-election-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Maybe the big gains so far this month shouldn\u2019t be a total surprise? \u201cYes, February historically has been a troublesome month for stocks,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cYet over the past decade, no month has seen better returns.\u201d In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 2.34% on average in February over the past decade, compared with the second best month of October\u2019s gain of 2.29%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/february-is-usually-weak-but-has-been-the-best-month-the-past-10-years.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Record Pace of Records\n\n&gt; Let's preface this with the fact that it's still early in the year and the rest of the year is unlikely to closely follow the path we have seen so far, but the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace for its 11th record closing high this year. While we're just 29 trading days into the year, in the post-WWII period, 2020 already ranks as the 33rd highest number of record closing highs for the S&amp;P 500 in a given year (out of 76). What's even more notable, though, is that at the current pace the S&amp;P 500 would have 96 record closes this year, which would dwarf the total from every other year. For reference, the highest number of record closing highs in a given year was 77 in 1995, and there are only four other years (1961, 1964, 2014, and 2017) where there were more than 50 record closes.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Continues to Gain Share of World Market Cap\n\n&gt; The United States dominates the rest of the world in terms of its share of total equity market capitalization. Currently, US stocks make up over 40% of global equities' total market cap. No other country comes even close to this size with the next largest country being China with just 8.47% and then Japan with 7.09%. Hong Kong is the only other individual county with a share larger than 5%. While France is the largest European Union country stock market in terms of the percentage of world market cap at only 3%, the total share of all EU countries shown sits at over 10%. Former EU member, the United Kingdon, is also one of the larger countries but has consistently lost share over the past decade. So far this year it has lost another 0.2%.\n\n&gt; One interesting change that we noted at the end of last year has been the massive increase in Saudi Arabia's share thanks to one of the world's largest companies, Saudi Aramco, hitting public markets. Although it has led to a massive jump over the long run, since the start of the year Saudi Arabia's share of market cap has fallen 14 bps likely due to Saudi Aramco being a one-way trade lower off of its highs that were put in place only a few days after its IPO. Meanwhile, the US has taken another 1.17% of the world's market cap in 2020 alone.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/World-Market-Cap2.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are several individual countries that are actually outperforming the US so far in 2020, generally speaking, the US has outperformed the rest of the world which is why the US has taken more market cap this year. Whereas the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.93% YTD as of yesterday's close, MSCI's World Index excluding the US is just about flat. That trend of US outperformance has been in place for much of the past year well before the coronavirus hit Asia in December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RS-ROW.png))**\n\n&gt; Another interesting country to note is China. 2020 has been off to a rocky start thanks to the coronavirus. This had sent the country's share of global market cap plummeting down to ~8% on February 3rd. That was its lowest level since February of last year. But as this month has progressed and the situation surrounding the virus has improved, China has regained some of those losses and is now sitting with a larger share of world market cap than it ended 2019 with.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/China-Percent.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Things Are Looking Up\n\n&gt; Stocks had their best week in 8 months last week, as the worst of the coronavirus fears subsided and the US economy showed some impressive resolve. Last, the LPL Strategists discuss why international stocks could finally be close to having their time in the sun after lagging the US for much of the past decade.\n\n&gt; # DEVELOPED MARKETS ARE LOOKING BETTER\n&gt; Developed markets have lagged the US for more than 10 years now. Although we aren\u2019t ready to fully invest in these areas, we are starting to see signs to warm up to international equites. As the LPL Strategists discuss, values are historically cheap relative to the US, global growth is stabilizing, growth leadership my start to weaken, and the US dollar should be pressured lower. Should any of those four reasons begin to take place, it could create a nice tailwind for international stocks.\n\n&gt; # THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS\n&gt; Equity markets bounced nicely last week, as fears over the coronavirus appear to be calming. The loss of lives is devastating, but markets are focusing on this fast spreading, yet low death rate of this virus versus other dangerous outbreaks. The LPL Strategists noted that China could very well see flat GDP growth in Q1, a big pick up later in 2020 could be likely. Additionally, don\u2019t forget that the US economy actually got stronger during the SARS outbreak in 2003.\n\n&gt; # SOME MORE GOOD NEWS\n&gt; Further supporting stocks last week was a trio of solid economic data in the US. The jobs report in January showed a very solid 225,000 jobs created, well above expectations. Additionally, much better than expected manufacturing data and solid services data show an economy that continues to defy the naysayers. Last, productivity in Q4 bounced and for the year it was the highest nonfarm productivity since 2010.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/images/Article_Page/WMC_02102020_1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Another \"Delay\" in the Value Trade\n\n&gt; How many times over the last few years have you heard something to the tune of \"The time for value stocks to outperform is now.\" Well, we're still waiting. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Value Index versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index going back to 1995. A quick warning: if you have a sensitive stomach you may want to skip the chart altogether.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-Value-vs-Growth.png))**\n\n&gt; From 1995 right up to the bull market peak in 2000, value stocks couldn't catch a break as they steadily underperformed growth stocks. Those were the days when Energy as a sector was 'dead' and investors couldn't get enough of tech IPOs with trendy sounding names. The low for value stocks on a relative basis came on 3/27/00, and from there the reversal was swift. By April of 2001, value stocks had regained nearly all of the ground they lost relative to growth during the late 1990s. Unfortunately for investors in both types of strategies, the outperformance in value wasn't the result of a monster rally, but instead a massive decline in growth stocks.\n\n&gt; From April 2001 through late 2002, value stocks underperformed again as the Worldcom and Enron accounting scandals cast a pall over sectors like Telecom Services and Utilities - two sectors traditionally comprised predominantly by value stocks. As the dust settled on those two scandals, though, and the economy stabilized, value stocks rallied again as Energy, Financials, and Materials stocks boomed.\n\n&gt; As the Financial sector began to unravel in 2007 and oil prices peaked in 2008, value stocks once again cratered relative to growth. Growth has maintained its lead over value ever since. Outside of some periods where value stocks briefly popped and strategist after strategist came out and said this time the rally is for real, growth stocks have left value stocks in the dust. Just last year, the underperformance of value stocks marked a major milestone as they took out their lows in relative strength versus growth stocks. While the S&amp;P 500 Value Index saw a modest bounce towards the end of last year, any momentum it had has quickly been erased in 2020 as the ratio between it and the S&amp;P 500 Growth index is now at fresh lows.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 14th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.16.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$ENPH** \n&gt; * **$INMD** \n&gt; * **$TRU** \n&gt; * **$WAB** \n&gt; * **$AEIS** \n&gt; * **$WING** \n&gt; * **$BHC** \n&gt; * **$VMC** \n&gt; * **$GRMN** \n&gt; * **$LDOS** \n&gt; * **$TSEM** \n&gt; * **$ECL** \n&gt; * **$ALLE** \n&gt; * **$GRPN** \n&gt; * **$CEVA** \n&gt; * **$OLED** \n&gt; * **$DBX** \n&gt; * **$NXRT** \n&gt; * **$BLMN** \n&gt; * **$ATH** \n&gt; * **$WIX** \n&gt; * **$FANG** \n&gt; * **$CEQP** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$FLR** \n&gt; * **$ZS** \n&gt; * **$VG** \n&gt; * **$SIX** \n&gt; * **$A** \n&gt; * **$CHH** \n&gt; * **$SEDG** \n&gt; * **$NVTA** \n&gt; * **$IMAX** \n&gt; * **$AG** \n&gt; * **$EXPD** \n&gt; * **$FSLR** \n&gt; * **$STNG** \n&gt; * **$AKS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/j9w4IR8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/siAY14P.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/kpCRctt.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.
