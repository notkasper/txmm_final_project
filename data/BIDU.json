new competition in the Chinese EV space. According to multiple reports, internet giant Baidu appears to be planning to build electric vehicles. It poses a risk for incumbent car makers, but it also shows how hot the Chinese EV market has become.\n\nBaidu (ticker: BIDU) doesn't make cars; the internet software and services company is a little like the Google of China. Baidu declined to comment when asked about its EV plans.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives believes \"this is a matter of when, not if, Baidu gets into EV production, given the massive pent up demand in China.\" He says its entrance into the sector could ultimately be a joint venture with an existing auto maker.\n\nSurprisingly, Chinese EV stocks weren't dented by the idea of new competition from Baidu -- in fact, they appeared to get a boost from the possibility. NIO (NIO) shares gained 6.2%, XPeng (XPEV) gained 4.9%, and Li Auto (LI) gained 2.6% on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 also had strong days, closing up 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively.\n\nThere wasn't much news otherwise to explain Tuesday's gains. NIO completed a secondary offering Monday. Analysts at Daiwa and Deutsche Bank launched coverage of Chinese EV stocks Monday. Those events, however, are a day old.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives told Barron's that December EV sales are looking strong. That's one reason those stocks would rise.\n\nBut Tesla investors seemed to pay attention to the Baidu news, with the stock acting how one would expect when a possible competitive threat is announced. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped 1% in Tuesday trading. China is a key market for the EV behemoth.\n\nAnd Baidu investors were definitely paying attention. The company's shares rose 13.8% Tuesday, roughly adding $7 billion in market value.

According to multiple reports, internet giant Baidu appears to be planning to build electric vehicles. It poses a risk for incumbent car makers, but it also shows how hot the Chinese EV market has become.\n\nBaidu (ticker: BIDU) doesn't make cars; the internet software and services company is a little like the Google of China. Baidu declined to comment when asked about its EV plans.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives believes \"this is a matter of when, not if, Baidu gets into EV production, given the massive pent up demand in China.\" He says its entrance into the sector could ultimately be a joint venture with an existing auto maker.\n\nSurprisingly, Chinese EV stocks weren't dented by the idea of new competition from Baidu -- in fact, they appeared to get a boost from the possibility. NIO (NIO) shares gained 6.2%, XPeng (XPEV) gained 4.9%, and Li Auto (LI) gained 2.6% on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 also had strong days, closing up 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively.\n\nThere wasn't much news otherwise to explain Tuesday's gains. NIO completed a secondary offering Monday. Analysts at Daiwa and Deutsche Bank launched coverage of Chinese EV stocks Monday. Those events, however, are a day old.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives told Barron's that December EV sales are looking strong. That's one reason those stocks would rise.\n\nBut Tesla investors seemed to pay attention to the Baidu news, with the stock acting how one would expect when a possible competitive threat is announced. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped 1% in Tuesday trading. China is a key market for the EV behemoth.\n\nAnd Baidu investors were definitely paying attention. The company's shares rose 13.8% Tuesday, roughly adding $7 billion in market value. The Chinese EV sector, including Baidu, actually added roughly $14 billion on what amounts to a more competitive market. More EV producers means everyone gets a smaller slice of the pie. That's one interpretation of new competition.\n\nBut Baidu's potential entry also illustrates the strength of the Chinese EV market. Chinese car makers have had no problems selling all the battery-powered cars they can make, partly because of strong government support for the industry, including tax subsidies, license plate laws, and registration benefits.

Yesterday, Senate Leader Mitch McConnel said he would introduce a smaller, more targeted proposal to the Senate when the chamber reconvenes next Monday. He said \u201cWhen the full Senate returns on October 19th, our first order of business will be voting again on targeted relief for American workers, including new funding for the PPP.\u201d The estimated $500 billion deal is way below the $1.8 trillion package proposed by the White House earlier in the week, a sign that negotiations may be souring.

This unexpected rally comes amid a surge of coronavirus cases in the United States and Europe and concerns that more fiscal stimulus will not be passed.\n\nThe SPY finished \n\nAfter a steady decline from summer peaks through the beginning of September, new COVID-19 cases appear to be on the rise again in the United States. According to data from the *New York Times*, there have been 41,822 new cases per day in the country over the past week, a 14% increase from the previous 2 weeks. Among the states seeing the largest increases in new cases over the past 14 days are Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota.\n\nIn recent weeks, Europe has struggled to contain a surge in the number of coronavirus cases, with many countries reporting a record number of infections. In France 16,069 new case of Covid-19 were reported, a record for the country. The U.K., which recently announced plans to lockdown once again, reported a record 6,634. These numbers are worse than in March, at the beginning of the pandemic. In response to the increasingly precarious situation, European leaders decried the failure of countries to work together to collectively defeat the virus and told the U.N. General Assembly today that \\`\\`the time has come for countries to reinvent international cooperation.\u201d Throughout the pandemic, European nations have fought internally about access to equipment and vaccines, erected barriers among neighbors to keep out virus infections, and struggled to agree on collective solutions to fight COVID.\n\nToday\u2019s rally in the stock market reflects the heightened volatility equities have experienced this month, as concerns over the presidential elections, a surge in coronavirus cases, the slowing pace of economic recovery, and the lack of fiscal stimulus pile up. House Democrats are reportedly working on a $2.4 trillion stimulus plan, which would be down from the more than $3 trillion they originally pursued, but a sum still well above the closer to $1 trillion proposal Senate Republicans had suggested they might accept. \n\nFor their part, monetary officials like Powell and Mnuchin have urged time and again for Congress to pass additional fiscal relief, though the window of opportunity continues to shrink as the November election looms. Eric Rosengren, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, told Yahoo Finance that while the central bank could increase asset purchases to try and support the economy, he was not sure it would be \u201cnearly as supportive, for example, as fiscal policy.\u201d\n\nTaken together, the myriad concerns manifested themselves in a surge in volatility this month, with stocks changing direction from one day to the next and even intraday. Matt Orton, Director and Portfolio Manager at Carillon Tower Advisers said, \u201cWe\u2019ve shot up really, really far. We\u2019ve just \\[gone\\] through a little bit of a corrective process, taking out some of the froth from the really high-flying performers in the information technology space. And right now with an absence of many catalysts as we head into earnings season, we\u2019re likely going to continue to move sideways.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Costco (COST) shares opened lower Friday despite reporting better-than-expected.

This unexpected rally comes amid a surge of coronavirus cases in the United States and Europe and concerns that more fiscal stimulus will not be passed.\n\nThe SPY finished \n\nAfter a steady decline from summer peaks through the beginning of September, new COVID-19 cases appear to be on the rise again in the United States. According to data from the *New York Times*, there have been 41,822 new cases per day in the country over the past week, a 14% increase from the previous 2 weeks. Among the states seeing the largest increases in new cases over the past 14 days are Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota.\n\nIn recent weeks, Europe has struggled to contain a surge in the number of coronavirus cases, with many countries reporting a record number of infections. In France 16,069 new case of Covid-19 were reported, a record for the country. The U.K., which recently announced plans to lockdown once again, reported a record 6,634. These numbers are worse than in March, at the beginning of the pandemic. In response to the increasingly precarious situation, European leaders decried the failure of countries to work together to collectively defeat the virus and told the U.N. General Assembly today that \\`\\`the time has come for countries to reinvent international cooperation.\u201d Throughout the pandemic, European nations have fought internally about access to equipment and vaccines, erected barriers among neighbors to keep out virus infections, and struggled to agree on collective solutions to fight COVID.\n\nToday\u2019s rally in the stock market reflects the heightened volatility equities have experienced this month, as concerns over the presidential elections, a surge in coronavirus cases, the slowing pace of economic recovery, and the lack of fiscal stimulus pile up. House Democrats are reportedly working on a $2.4 trillion stimulus plan, which would be down from the more than $3 trillion they originally pursued, but a sum still well above the closer to $1 trillion proposal Senate Republicans had suggested they might accept. \n\nFor their part, monetary officials like Powell and Mnuchin have urged time and again for Congress to pass additional fiscal relief, though the window of opportunity continues to shrink as the November election looms. Eric Rosengren, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, told Yahoo Finance that while the central bank could increase asset purchases to try and support the economy, he was not sure it would be \u201cnearly as supportive, for example, as fiscal policy.\u201d\n\nTaken together, the myriad concerns manifested themselves in a surge in volatility this month, with stocks changing direction from one day to the next and even intraday. Matt Orton, Director and Portfolio Manager at Carillon Tower Advisers said, \u201cWe\u2019ve shot up really, really far. We\u2019ve just \\[gone\\] through a little bit of a corrective process, taking out some of the froth from the really high-flying performers in the information technology space. And right now with an absence of many catalysts as we head into earnings season, we\u2019re likely going to continue to move sideways.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Costco (COST) shares opened lower Friday despite reporting better-than-expected.

and artificial-intelligence software company posted mixed June-quarter financial results. The stock is also likely being pressured by the disclosure that Baidu\u2019s 56%-owned iQIYI \ufffc video unit is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nFor the quarter, Baidu (ticker: BIDU) reported revenue of $3.69 billion, down about 1% from a year ago, and in line with the Wall Street analyst consensus at $3.7 billion. Non-GAAP profits were $2.08 a share, well ahead of the Street consensus at $1.38. Baidu said adjusted Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) was $993 million.\n\nBaidu CEO Robin Li said in statement that \u201cwith COVID-19 becoming more manageable in China, Baidu\u2019s business is steadily rebounding.\u201d He noted that \u201cin-app revenue grew in the second quarter, despite a challenging macro environment.\"\n\nThe company bought back $540 million of stock in the second quarter, bringing repurchases over the past two years to $1.9 billion. Baidu also said its board has expanded its stock-repurchase authorization to $3 billion from $1 billion, effective through 2022. Baidu finished the quarter with $21.8 billion in cash and short-term investments.\n\nFor the September quarter, Baidu sees revenue ranging from $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, representing growth of minus 6% to plus 2%.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 10th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets could be challenged by Washington stimulus talks and China tensions  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/07/markets-could-be-challenged-by-washington-stimulus-talks-and-china-tensions.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The debate in Washington over the next round of fiscal stimulus and rising tensions between the White House and China could act as brakes on the stock market in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rallied in the past week but were more sluggish Friday, as investors watched stimulus talks between Democrats and the Trump administration stall out. Investors also were concerned that President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning U.S. transactions with Tencent\u2019s We Chat and Bytedance\u2019s Tik Tok would accelerate the deterioration of relations between the U.S. and China and draw retribution.\n*****\n&gt; Just ahead of Friday\u2019s market close, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said just that he is recommending the White House move forward with executive orders on unemployment, student loans and rental foreclosures. He said a compromise could not be reached with Democrats, who wanted a $2 trillion package. Stocks edged higher after the announcement though details of the orders and how any assistance could be funded were unclear.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to bring the Democrats back to the table to negotiate a deal by threatening to use an executive order. They may be able to get some things down, but it won\u2019t be enough to create the bridge they need while the economy continues to repair itself,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 2.4% for the week, ending at 3,351, after a 2 point gain Friday. The Nasdaq was down 0.9% Friday, ending at 11,010. It was up 2.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPart of the reason stocks have held in there well and continue to melt up is that one of the things that is priced in is a fifth fiscal policy package of $1.5 trillion. if we don\u2019t get one, I do think the market will retrace lower to reflect a lack of stimulus,\u201d said Arone. \u201cThe recovery will stall out without one.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; As for China, it has so far not taken actions against U.S. companies, even with the Trump administration\u2019s moves to block Chinese telecom giant Huawei from using U.S. parts. The latest steps, however, raised concerns that China could find ways to retaliate, and that the U.S. will bar Chinese IPOs.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn balance, continued hostility toward China is going to be a continued net negative for U.S. companies that are revenue exposed to China,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG. \u201cWe know the exposure is very centered in the Nasdaq names.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the stock market is entering a seasonally weak time, and while market psychology is still strong it could start to change. \u201cThe seasonals are starting to shift negatively. We all know September is a poor month and the degree of the escalation of the tensions between the U.S. in China is not a surprise, but the degree of the escalation over the last 48 hours is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not changing psychology, but it\u2019s challenging bullish psychology.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, there are some final earnings of the season, including technology company Cisco and food company Sysco. Some travel companies including Royal Caribbean report, as does consumer goods company Tapestry. In the week after, big retailers roll out their reports in the final earnings burst of the quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Economic reports could be important in the coming week, as investors watch consumer price index inflation data Wednesday and retail sales Friday. Retail sales should provide a window into the consumer, as workers returned to their jobs but also faced uncertainty because of reclosings.\n*****\n&gt; CPI is important as the market has been assuming inflation will ultimately start to show gains because of the weakening dollar and ballooning budget deficits. CPI last month showed a 0.6% increase month over month.\n*****\n&gt; The pro-inflation trade has become important and has driven investors into stocks, gold, and out of the dollar.\n*****\n&gt; # Watch this trade\nThe dollar could be the key to the fate of markets in the coming week. The U.S. currency was edging higher Friday but is still down about 3.5% over the past four weeks. Gold declined Friday, and Treasury yields moved lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe dollar ... to me it just continues to be an important barometer that has a unique intersection of rates, inflation and risk assets,\u201d said Arone. \u201cWith rising China, U.S. tensions and combined with the fact that there\u2019s uncertainty about the fiscal policy package and the fact the dollar has declined so quickly, many are expecting it to catch a bid here and rebound.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Part of the move in the dollar was based on the idea that huge government spending would increase the government\u2019s deficit and Treasury issuance. Emanuel said the news on stimulus could have a big impact on the trade.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe would make the argument the baseline expectation was a trillion dollars worth of stimulus to be implemented sometime in the month of August. Anything below that expectation is likely to cause the dollar to strengthen,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cIt\u2019s a momentum and positioning trade as well as what has been ... the unwind of an asset diversification trade.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The stalling of talks could shift the market\u2019s view that the U.S. is willing to spend any amount to fight the impact of the coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s changing the market psychology that the government\u2019s propensity to spend infinitely is not as great as it was earlier in the week,,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cThe dollar rallying, from our perspective, is a direct threat to a lot of these momentum trades.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said a strengthening dollar could be a headwind for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGiven the friction with China, to the extent the inflation numbers come in weaker than expected, the argument being that whole weaker dollar asset diversification has helped feed into increasing inflation expectations,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cIf the inflation data does surprise to the downside, given the rally in inflation ...it\u2019s further potential for the unwinding of the short dollar trade and the unwinding of the long gold trade which in our view bleeds over into stocks.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Hd63ibb.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/JB5lwYJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/QGdJU9H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/wMC2Lp9B/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ohAnmHN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gbbisXK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/IRn34qI.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1lbSlRY.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/v2nYSz6.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C1gBrzCq/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/TYFPHKf3/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/KvRzNPXW/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/ryhsxhHW/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Individual Investors Still Don't Believe\n\n&gt; As mentioned in a prior post, in the past week the S&amp;P 500 has moved within 2% of its 2/19 high, but at the same time, less than a quarter of AAII respondents are optimistic for the future of stocks over the next six months. That begs the question- if there have been past times that sentiment and price action have been so detached from one another. Since the start of the AAII survey in 1987, there have been 10 periods (including the current one) in which the S&amp;P 500 was within 2% of an all-time high but bullish sentiment was less than 25% without another occurrence in the prior three months. The most recent prior occurrence was not even a full year ago. Back in October, sentiment was only slightly higher as the S&amp;P 500 was 1.84% from its all-time high. Prior to that, there were some scattered instances throughout 2013, 2015, and 2016 but before that, you would have to go back to 1993 to find another similar period. The one occurrence in 2013 stands out as it was both the lowest sentiment reading of these prior occurrences and the only one that occurred with the S&amp;P 500 right at an all-time high.\n\n&gt; As for where things stand after such instances, sentiment has tended to reverse higher in the following six months as the S&amp;P 500 has tended to move higher. The S&amp;P 500 has actually tended towards better than average returns over the next three months, although performance six months out has been modestly worse than average, even as it has been higher more often than not. Additionally, as shown in the second chart below, of the more recent occurrences of the past decade, they haven't marked any major top or bottom for the S&amp;P 500 with occurrences clustered both coming off of lows and in the middle of longer-term uptrends.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-AAII-and-SP-500-within-2-table.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-AAII-and-SP-500.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Silver Takes the Gold\n\n&gt; Gold and silver prices were already on a tear heading into this week, but they've only seen their gains accelerate even more. With more than a day and a half of trading left in the week, front-month gold futures have rallied, but silver has been the real show stopper with a gain of 16%!\n\n&gt; Taking a look at a one-year chart of silver over the last year, things have really gone parabolic this week as the front-month futures contract is trading more than 40% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and 62% above its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Silver.png))**\n\n&gt; Were it not for the move in silver, gold's move would be getting all the attention. Prices for gold have also seen a major surge in the last month, rising from under $1,800 to the current level of $2,060 per ounce. While not as extended as silver, gold currently trades 14% above its 50-DMA and 26% above its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Gold.png))**\n\n&gt; With gold 25.7% above its 200-DMA and silver 62.2% above, the average spread of the two commodities currently stands at 44.3%. In the 40+ year history of the two futures contracts, there have only been a handful of prior periods where the average spread of the two commodities was larger or even above 35% for that matter with the most recent occurring back in early 2011. This recent rally in the two commodities has certainly been one for the ages.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Gold-Silver-Combined35.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Moves Off 52-Week Lows\n\n&gt; Within the US equity market, we've seen some major moves in individual stocks off their 52-week lows over the last few months. Look at the table below. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the performance of the largest companies in the US, stocks in the index are up an average of 87.6% from their respective 52-week lows. Looking at performance by individual sectors, stocks in the Energy sector are up an average of 136.8%, while the average Consumer Discretionary stock has rallied 131.4%. The Technology sector wasn't hit nearly as hard by the Covid-crash as other sectors, but stocks in the sector have doubled on an average basis relative to their 52-week lows. The only sector where stocks are up less than 50% on an average basis from their 52-week lows is Utilities at 46.33%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080520-Rusell-1000-change-from-52-week-low.png))**\n\n&gt; For many investors, the holy grail of stock picking is the proverbial ten-bagger. A ten-bagger is a stock that multiplies by ten times its original price. Usually, this happens over the span of years, but in the Covid-economy, we've actually seen a number of these ten-baggers play out in the span of months. While most of these examples are in the small-cap space, shares of Wayfair (W), which has a current market cap of $27.5 billion, have rallied from $21.70 on March 19th to its current price of $290.85 now. That's a gain of more than 1,200% in less than five months!\n\n&gt; Within the entire Russell 1,000, 257 stocks have at least doubled off their 52-week lows, and in the table below we highlight the 34 stocks that are at least a quarter of the way to the ten-bagger club and have rallied more than 250%. As mentioned above, W tops the list, but Fastly (FSLY), which has barely been public for a year, is just shy of the club with a gain of 992%. Behind FSLY, Livongo Health (LVGO) is up 855%. Given that LVGO just got a takeover offer from Teladoc (TDOC), the 11th best-performing stock on the list, it may only make the ten-bagger club under the banner of the TDOC ticker.\n\n&gt; In looking through the list of stocks shown, many of these names come from the Health Care, Technology, and Consumer Discretionary sectors and have been direct beneficiaries of the new Covid-economy. At the same time, six stocks from the Energy sector made the list as well as they recovered from their bombed-out levels after oil prices briefly traded in negative territory earlier this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080520-Rusell-1000-change-from-52-week-low-table-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far\n\n&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**\n\n&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/eps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Labor Market Continues Summer Momentum\n\n&gt; After falling the most on record in April, the US labor market has rebounded with three consecutive months of job gains, adding back more than 9 million of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April. In July, the economy added back nearly 1.8 million jobs, ahead of Bloomberg consensus estimates for 1.5 million and lowering the unemployment rate from 11.1% to 10.2%, but lingering measurement issues could add 1% to that number, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, job gains were broad based across industries, with a third of the increase coming from the leisure and hospitality sector\u2014the \u201cscene of the accident\u201d industries\u2014while only information, and mining and logging posted declines in July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.7.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMarch and April were historically brutal months for the labor market, but the labor market\u2019s resiliency this summer has been a welcome development,\u201d stated LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cHowever, the next few months will be critical for the economy as schools reopen and additional fiscal stimulus still hangs in the balance.\u201d\n\n&gt; The July report also comes on the heels of a rise in COVID-19 cases across the Sunbelt region of the United States. Because of the date of the survey, it may not fully reflect the economic impact of some of the more recent high-frequency data that has captured some of the effect of rising cases. Still, the jobs report shows that the US economy is continuing to heal despite the long road ahead.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are Recessions Good For Stocks?\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t like any recession we\u2019ve ever seen, as it was sparked by a horrible pandemic and happened because people were told to stay inside. The impact was the worst contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) last quarter that anyone who is reading this has ever seen. But what is quite surprising is the fact the Nasdaq has made 30 all-time highs so far in 2020, while the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained four consecutive months, all while the unemployment rate remains above 10%.\n\n&gt; Why is this happening? There are two main schools of thought. One is that stocks are forecasting a better economy later this year and into 2021; remember, stocks tend to lead the economy and could be doing so once again. Another school of thought is that the massive fiscal and monetary policy are boosting equity prices, while not helping the overall economy quite as much.\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s the catch. It actually isn\u2019t abnormal to see stocks gain during a recession. \u201cThis is one that might surprise many people, but stocks have actually gained during 7 of the past 12 recessions,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThere\u2019s no question the difference between what is happening on Wall Street compared with Main Street is about as wide as we\u2019ve ever seen, but maybe it shouldn\u2019t be as big of a surprise that stocks have been strong.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 actually gained 1.3% on average when looking at the 12 previous recessions going back to World War II, with a very impressive median advance of 5.7% (the average is skewed lower due to 2008). We continue to expect this recession to end soon, if it isn\u2019t over already. In fact, when the end of the recession is officially declared at a later date, we could have yet another recession that saw stock market gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.5.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NIO** \n&gt; * **$MELI** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$RCL** \n&gt; * **$DKNG** \n&gt; * **$MAR** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$MARK** \n&gt; * **$PRTK** \n&gt; * **$JMIA** \n&gt; * **$DUK** \n&gt; * **$SPG** \n&gt; * **$ON** \n&gt; * **$HUYA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$SEAS** \n&gt; * **$ICPT** \n&gt; * **$PRPL** \n&gt; * **$LYFT** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$FOLD** \n&gt; * **$CEVA** \n&gt; * **$DOYU** \n&gt; * **$SYY** \n&gt; * **$SDGR** \n&gt; * **$GOOS** \n&gt; * **$TTOO** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$TNK** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$GRWG**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/v2nYSz6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mjhw2qX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR MONDAY, AUGUST 10TH, 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/NHhXB13.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/H67Mg1J.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5DIQO1B.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RgQdixH.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdVRiJu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tuCqkCk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RqbAmnt.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pZjdCyt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ni20iSQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DgPcij6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LcirLAw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.14.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NIO Inc. $13.42\n&gt; **NIO Inc.

Option traders are pricing in a 5.8% move on earnings and the stock has averaged a 5.7% move in recent quarters.\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=CSCO&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 784088, "public", "self", "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 10th, 2020", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i62640/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "all_ads", 6, 1596901196.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bigbear0083", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_eaak0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1596904796, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i62640/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i62640", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "news", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "866eb162-65e6-11e5-a903-1252b640afe9", "link_flair_text": "News", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/i62640/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "MPRteZJ0CZvyspsd1hEtXfMOGxkLLvI917ham1D81FU", "resolutions": [{"height": 66, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JzTXRns4aIi2FoTjQqoa1wsZVCNKBYbFdYup8iFiz40.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c9d9ca992a388352ca36787f8fd7098a6d47636", "width": 108}, {"height": 132, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JzTXRns4aIi2FoTjQqoa1wsZVCNKBYbFdYup8iFiz40.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82921130e110d25338ac112664cf29d3bc701ea2", "width": 216}, {"height": 196, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JzTXRns4aIi2FoTjQqoa1wsZVCNKBYbFdYup8iFiz40.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f408a42ff72d23321d51ad953476ccccfe4b0f53", "width": 320}, {"height": 393, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JzTXRns4aIi2FoTjQqoa1wsZVCNKBYbFdYup8iFiz40.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34f725245a68d055bfbe69f8cf8739b0e411339a", "width": 640}, {"height": 590, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JzTXRns4aIi2FoTjQqoa1wsZVCNKBYbFdYup8iFiz40.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c3631aec1d12ee88bdb32937e4f007c5b78c932", "width": 960}, {"height": 664, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JzTXRns4aIi2FoTjQqoa1wsZVCNKBYbFdYup8iFiz40.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec0b425b91145d06bdc3b26c95dff10565a983b1", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 760, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JzTXRns4aIi2FoTjQqoa1wsZVCNKBYbFdYup8iFiz40.png?auto=webp&amp;s=b6cf767661afd26589d72bcef938374864a60f0c", "width": 1235}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1596904806, "score": 1, "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 10th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets could be challenged by Washington stimulus talks and China tensions  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/07/markets-could-be-challenged-by-washington-stimulus-talks-and-china-tensions.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The debate in Washington over the next round of fiscal stimulus and rising tensions between the White House and China could act as brakes on the stock market in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rallied in the past week but were more sluggish Friday, as investors watched stimulus talks between Democrats and the Trump administration stall out. Investors also were concerned that President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning U.S. transactions with Tencent\u2019s We Chat and Bytedance\u2019s Tik Tok would accelerate the deterioration of relations between the U.S. and China and draw retribution.\n*****\n&gt; Just ahead of Friday\u2019s market close, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said just that he is recommending the White House move forward with executive orders on unemployment, student loans and rental foreclosures. He said a compromise could not be reached with Democrats, who wanted a $2 trillion package. Stocks edged higher after the announcement though details of the orders and how any assistance could be funded were unclear.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to bring the Democrats back to the table to negotiate a deal by threatening to use an executive order. They may be able to get some things down, but it won\u2019t be enough to create the bridge they need while the economy continues to repair itself,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 2.4% for the week, ending at 3,351, after a 2 point gain Friday. The Nasdaq was down 0.9% Friday, ending at 11,010. It was up 2.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPart of the reason stocks have held in there well and continue to melt up is that one of the things that is priced in is a fifth fiscal policy package of $1.5 trillion. if we don\u2019t get one, I do think the market will retrace lower to reflect a lack of stimulus,\u201d said Arone. \u201cThe recovery will stall out without one.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; As for China, it has so far not taken actions against U.S. companies, even with the Trump administration\u2019s moves to block Chinese telecom giant Huawei from using U.S. parts. The latest steps, however, raised concerns that China could find ways to retaliate, and that the U.S. will bar Chinese IPOs.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn balance, continued hostility toward China is going to be a continued net negative for U.S. companies that are revenue exposed to China,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG. \u201cWe know the exposure is very centered in the Nasdaq names.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the stock market is entering a seasonally weak time, and while market psychology is still strong it could start to change. \u201cThe seasonals are starting to shift negatively. We all know September is a poor month and the degree of the escalation of the tensions between the U.S. in China is not a surprise, but the degree of the escalation over the last 48 hours is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not changing psychology, but it\u2019s challenging bullish psychology.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, there are some final earnings of the season, including technology company Cisco and food company Sysco. Some travel companies including Royal Caribbean report, as does consumer goods company Tapestry. In the week after, big retailers roll out their reports in the final earnings burst of the quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Economic reports could be important in the coming week, as investors watch consumer price index inflation data Wednesday and retail sales Friday. Retail sales should provide a window into the consumer, as workers returned to their jobs but also faced uncertainty because of reclosings.\n*****\n&gt; CPI is important as the market has been assuming inflation will ultimately start to show gains because of the weakening dollar and ballooning budget deficits. CPI last month showed a 0.6% increase month over month.\n*****\n&gt; The pro-inflation trade has become important and has driven investors into stocks, gold, and out of the dollar.\n*****\n&gt; # Watch this trade\nThe dollar could be the key to the fate of markets in the coming week. The U.S. currency was edging higher Friday but is still down about 3.5% over the past four weeks. Gold declined Friday, and Treasury yields moved lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe dollar ... to me it just continues to be an important barometer that has a unique intersection of rates, inflation and risk assets,\u201d said Arone. \u201cWith rising China, U.S. tensions and combined with the fact that there\u2019s uncertainty about the fiscal policy package and the fact the dollar has declined so quickly, many are expecting it to catch a bid here and rebound.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Part of the move in the dollar was based on the idea that huge government spending would increase the government\u2019s deficit and Treasury issuance. Emanuel said the news on stimulus could have a big impact on the trade.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe would make the argument the baseline expectation was a trillion dollars worth of stimulus to be implemented sometime in the month of August. Anything below that expectation is likely to cause the dollar to strengthen,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cIt\u2019s a momentum and positioning trade as well as what has been ... the unwind of an asset diversification trade.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The stalling of talks could shift the market\u2019s view that the U.S. is willing to spend any amount to fight the impact of the coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s changing the market psychology that the government\u2019s propensity to spend infinitely is not as great as it was earlier in the week,,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cThe dollar rallying, from our perspective, is a direct threat to a lot of these momentum trades.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said a strengthening dollar could be a headwind for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGiven the friction with China, to the extent the inflation numbers come in weaker than expected, the argument being that whole weaker dollar asset diversification has helped feed into increasing inflation expectations,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cIf the inflation data does surprise to the downside, given the rally in inflation ...it\u2019s further potential for the unwinding of the short dollar trade and the unwinding of the long gold trade which in our view bleeds over into stocks.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Hd63ibb.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/JB5lwYJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/QGdJU9H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/wMC2Lp9B/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ohAnmHN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gbbisXK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/IRn34qI.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1lbSlRY.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/v2nYSz6.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C1gBrzCq/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/TYFPHKf3/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/KvRzNPXW/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/ryhsxhHW/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Individual Investors Still Don't Believe\n\n&gt; As mentioned in a prior post, in the past week the S&amp;P 500 has moved within 2% of its 2/19 high, but at the same time, less than a quarter of AAII respondents are optimistic for the future of stocks over the next six months. That begs the question- if there have been past times that sentiment and price action have been so detached from one another. Since the start of the AAII survey in 1987, there have been 10 periods (including the current one) in which the S&amp;P 500 was within 2% of an all-time high but bullish sentiment was less than 25% without another occurrence in the prior three months. The most recent prior occurrence was not even a full year ago. Back in October, sentiment was only slightly higher as the S&amp;P 500 was 1.84% from its all-time high. Prior to that, there were some scattered instances throughout 2013, 2015, and 2016 but before that, you would have to go back to 1993 to find another similar period. The one occurrence in 2013 stands out as it was both the lowest sentiment reading of these prior occurrences and the only one that occurred with the S&amp;P 500 right at an all-time high.\n\n&gt; As for where things stand after such instances, sentiment has tended to reverse higher in the following six months as the S&amp;P 500 has tended to move higher. The S&amp;P 500 has actually tended towards better than average returns over the next three months, although performance six months out has been modestly worse than average, even as it has been higher more often than not. Additionally, as shown in the second chart below, of the more recent occurrences of the past decade, they haven't marked any major top or bottom for the S&amp;P 500 with occurrences clustered both coming off of lows and in the middle of longer-term uptrends.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-AAII-and-SP-500-within-2-table.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-AAII-and-SP-500.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Silver Takes the Gold\n\n&gt; Gold and silver prices were already on a tear heading into this week, but they've only seen their gains accelerate even more. With more than a day and a half of trading left in the week, front-month gold futures have rallied, but silver has been the real show stopper with a gain of 16%!\n\n&gt; Taking a look at a one-year chart of silver over the last year, things have really gone parabolic this week as the front-month futures contract is trading more than 40% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and 62% above its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Silver.png))**\n\n&gt; Were it not for the move in silver, gold's move would be getting all the attention. Prices for gold have also seen a major surge in the last month, rising from under $1,800 to the current level of $2,060 per ounce. While not as extended as silver, gold currently trades 14% above its 50-DMA and 26% above its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Gold.png))**\n\n&gt; With gold 25.7% above its 200-DMA and silver 62.2% above, the average spread of the two commodities currently stands at 44.3%. In the 40+ year history of the two futures contracts, there have only been a handful of prior periods where the average spread of the two commodities was larger or even above 35% for that matter with the most recent occurring back in early 2011. This recent rally in the two commodities has certainly been one for the ages.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Gold-Silver-Combined35.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Moves Off 52-Week Lows\n\n&gt; Within the US equity market, we've seen some major moves in individual stocks off their 52-week lows over the last few months. Look at the table below. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the performance of the largest companies in the US, stocks in the index are up an average of 87.6% from their respective 52-week lows. Looking at performance by individual sectors, stocks in the Energy sector are up an average of 136.8%, while the average Consumer Discretionary stock has rallied 131.4%. The Technology sector wasn't hit nearly as hard by the Covid-crash as other sectors, but stocks in the sector have doubled on an average basis relative to their 52-week lows. The only sector where stocks are up less than 50% on an average basis from their 52-week lows is Utilities at 46.33%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080520-Rusell-1000-change-from-52-week-low.png))**\n\n&gt; For many investors, the holy grail of stock picking is the proverbial ten-bagger. A ten-bagger is a stock that multiplies by ten times its original price. Usually, this happens over the span of years, but in the Covid-economy, we've actually seen a number of these ten-baggers play out in the span of months. While most of these examples are in the small-cap space, shares of Wayfair (W), which has a current market cap of $27.5 billion, have rallied from $21.70 on March 19th to its current price of $290.85 now. That's a gain of more than 1,200% in less than five months!\n\n&gt; Within the entire Russell 1,000, 257 stocks have at least doubled off their 52-week lows, and in the table below we highlight the 34 stocks that are at least a quarter of the way to the ten-bagger club and have rallied more than 250%. As mentioned above, W tops the list, but Fastly (FSLY), which has barely been public for a year, is just shy of the club with a gain of 992%. Behind FSLY, Livongo Health (LVGO) is up 855%. Given that LVGO just got a takeover offer from Teladoc (TDOC), the 11th best-performing stock on the list, it may only make the ten-bagger club under the banner of the TDOC ticker.\n\n&gt; In looking through the list of stocks shown, many of these names come from the Health Care, Technology, and Consumer Discretionary sectors and have been direct beneficiaries of the new Covid-economy. At the same time, six stocks from the Energy sector made the list as well as they recovered from their bombed-out levels after oil prices briefly traded in negative territory earlier this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080520-Rusell-1000-change-from-52-week-low-table-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far\n\n&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**\n\n&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/eps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Labor Market Continues Summer Momentum\n\n&gt; After falling the most on record in April, the US labor market has rebounded with three consecutive months of job gains, adding back more than 9 million of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April. In July, the economy added back nearly 1.8 million jobs, ahead of Bloomberg consensus estimates for 1.5 million and lowering the unemployment rate from 11.1% to 10.2%, but lingering measurement issues could add 1% to that number, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, job gains were broad based across industries, with a third of the increase coming from the leisure and hospitality sector\u2014the \u201cscene of the accident\u201d industries\u2014while only information, and mining and logging posted declines in July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.7.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMarch and April were historically brutal months for the labor market, but the labor market\u2019s resiliency this summer has been a welcome development,\u201d stated LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cHowever, the next few months will be critical for the economy as schools reopen and additional fiscal stimulus still hangs in the balance.\u201d\n\n&gt; The July report also comes on the heels of a rise in COVID-19 cases across the Sunbelt region of the United States. Because of the date of the survey, it may not fully reflect the economic impact of some of the more recent high-frequency data that has captured some of the effect of rising cases. Still, the jobs report shows that the US economy is continuing to heal despite the long road ahead.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are Recessions Good For Stocks?\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t like any recession we\u2019ve ever seen, as it was sparked by a horrible pandemic and happened because people were told to stay inside. The impact was the worst contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) last quarter that anyone who is reading this has ever seen. But what is quite surprising is the fact the Nasdaq has made 30 all-time highs so far in 2020, while the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained four consecutive months, all while the unemployment rate remains above 10%.\n\n&gt; Why is this happening? There are two main schools of thought. One is that stocks are forecasting a better economy later this year and into 2021; remember, stocks tend to lead the economy and could be doing so once again. Another school of thought is that the massive fiscal and monetary policy are boosting equity prices, while not helping the overall economy quite as much.\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s the catch. It actually isn\u2019t abnormal to see stocks gain during a recession. \u201cThis is one that might surprise many people, but stocks have actually gained during 7 of the past 12 recessions,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThere\u2019s no question the difference between what is happening on Wall Street compared with Main Street is about as wide as we\u2019ve ever seen, but maybe it shouldn\u2019t be as big of a surprise that stocks have been strong.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 actually gained 1.3% on average when looking at the 12 previous recessions going back to World War II, with a very impressive median advance of 5.7% (the average is skewed lower due to 2008). We continue to expect this recession to end soon, if it isn\u2019t over already. In fact, when the end of the recession is officially declared at a later date, we could have yet another recession that saw stock market gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.5.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NIO** \n&gt; * **$MELI** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$RCL** \n&gt; * **$DKNG** \n&gt; * **$MAR** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$MARK** \n&gt; * **$PRTK** \n&gt; * **$JMIA** \n&gt; * **$DUK** \n&gt; * **$SPG** \n&gt; * **$ON** \n&gt; * **$HUYA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$SEAS** \n&gt; * **$ICPT** \n&gt; * **$PRPL** \n&gt; * **$LYFT** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$FOLD** \n&gt; * **$CEVA** \n&gt; * **$DOYU** \n&gt; * **$SYY** \n&gt; * **$SDGR** \n&gt; * **$GOOS** \n&gt; * **$TTOO** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$TNK** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$GRWG**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/v2nYSz6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mjhw2qX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR MONDAY, AUGUST 10TH, 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/NHhXB13.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/H67Mg1J.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5DIQO1B.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RgQdixH.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdVRiJu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tuCqkCk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RqbAmnt.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pZjdCyt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ni20iSQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DgPcij6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LcirLAw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.14.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NIO Inc. $13.42\n&gt; **NIO Inc.

A bunch of these launched 4-5 years or so ago and just like in the US they ran up as people jockeyed for position in companies that would one day might be successful.  Winners and losers were picked based on guesses, tea leaves and the statistics of young companies just trying to get traction.\n\nWhile researching many of these companies one (HUYA) caught my eye as they moved their earnings up 1 month.  Companies don\u2019t rush to tell people bad news. Here is the results of my research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHuya $1.15B Market Cap $17.13 Share Price NYSE\n\nEnterprise Value MRQ = $2.8B\n\n67.1 Million Shares Class A (The small amount of shares will amplify this rocketship)\n\n[Huya NYSE](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-HUYA/)\n\nConsidered the 3rd place streaming company by American Investors.  The reality though is it\u2019s number 2 and rising fast when viewed in the macro.  It started in 3rd place in American minds because of it's size, it was started in the 3rd biggest city though and had less to do with the other companies being more successful. Has much better business model and analytics compared to it\u2019s competitors.  One of the many reasons it\u2019s price is suppressed was being listed on NYSE and not NASDAQ like it\u2019s competitors. NYSE has been more negative for Chinese stocks and less sympathetic to tech compared to NASDAQ. Sometimes it\u2019s the little things that are actually big. Currently 12.5% shorted but was as high as 74% on 5/11\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost similar competitor\n\nDoyu  $2.41B Market Cap $7.60 Share Price NASDAQ\n\nEnterprise Value MRQ = $1.7B\n\n317.4 million Shares\n\n[Doyu NASDAQ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-DOYU/)\n\nConsidered the top Publicly Traded Chinese Game Streaming Company by Americans.  Has VERY FEW metrics that are better than Huya and has basically capitalized by taking early mindshare during the exploratory run up and less price suppression due to it being listed on NASDAQ. All the stats it beats Huya on are garbage stats that don\u2019t really mean much.\n\nFrom the jump we can tell that Huya is currently worth over DOUBLE what it trades for with just a cursory glance of the information above.  Let\u2019s talk about this awesome company that is about to take a rocket ship up.\n\nHuya has been working in the lab to become one of the most profitable companies that have EVER EXISTED.  We will discuss this in 3 parts\n\n1. Chinese Domestic Market =  One of the problems with evaluating Chinese companies is the West doesn\u2019t always trust their numbers.   Because of the closed nature of the Chinese Internet and language barriers it is hard for western investors to get a good grip on what is going on.  A lot of the numbers look crazy and Chinese companies in the past have used fake numbers and continue the fakery until they collapse.  This is a contributing factor to HUYA price suppression.\n\nThe video Game Live Streaming Market in China is maturing.  These companies are often called the \u201cTwitch\u201d of China.  In reality they are more like a hybrid of Only Fans, Twitch and ESPN or CBS\n\nLive Streaming is still their bread and butter\n\nTwitch Type Stuff with Gamers\n\n[Twitch type stuff with Gamers](https://www.huya.com/520jiege)\n\nOnly Fans Stuff but probably PG Rated\n\n[Only Fans type stuff but PG rated](https://www.huya.com/5920)\n\nLooks like there is even room for some men to livestream to girls or Chinese Gays.  Who knows\n\n[Livestreamers male and female](https://www.huya.com/g/4079)\n\nThe market is putting more emphasis towards live esports content. (Remember this for part 3)  Like ESPN of video games. This is happening in America as well, Professional sports have an EPIC problem on their hands.  12-24 year olds are starting to NOT WATCH ball and bat sports, they watch  ESPORTS.  Even jocks do this.  Professional sports are going to start to see a YOY erosion of viewership in the next 5 years.\n\nANYONE WHO HAS A TEEN RIGHT NOW CAN PROBABLY VERIFY THIS\n\n[This is the Future, Live Streamed eSports events](https://www.huya.com/2020cfpl)\n\nHuya just signed a bunch of exclusive content deals to secure the streaming rights of major tournaments.  The best western example of this I can give is CBS locking up March Madness and we know what a cash cow that is in America.  Huya is going to be the dominate player for future online esports content.\n\nThe Super Bowl, NBA Finals, World Series as we know it is DYING.  The writing is on the wall and it\u2019s just a matter of time. Do you want to be in on the switch NOW or once the rest of America figures it out?\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/9D1poyj](https://imgur.com/a/9D1poyj)\n\nAbove is a graph showing traffic to the Huya website.  Note the flat line for 5 months and then on the 6th the climb starts (Just 1 month of increased traffic will be on Q1 earnings FYI)  This can be attributed to Huya rolling out it\u2019s plan to be the destination for esports viewership.\n\nHuya has always made the most money pound for pound of any streaming platform in Asia. Their business model is just better.  90% of their revenues comes from the users themselves tipping their favorite streamers with virtual thingamajigs.  The system works and Huya has been able to consistently show some of the best profits.  They have been very smart over the past few years plowing said profits into future operations to the detriment of their share price.  Domestically they used these profits for securing rights so they can shift into a global media player. I\u2019d imagine that in the future Huya sees themselves as the ESPN of China with the twitch thing on the side because it is a cash cow. (Much the same way Netflix still does physical DVD\u2019s.  (It STILL makes fat stacks of cash by old economy standards)\n\nDomestically Huya is the BEST Live Stream play and they prove it with the $$$ but you can also see the stats.  Huya makes more money per on it\u2019s traffic vs competitors and it\u2019s not even close.\n\nAlso domestically things are shifting.  Doyu is falling off and Huya continues to grow and find more audience, better stats and more money. It\u2019s got better stats and better profits than it\u2019s competitor who has double the market cap.  Huya is the king of bad timing (Outside Forces) when it comes to their value and is ahead of the curve when it comes to preparing for the future.\n\nYou can compare some of the stats here\n\n[Alexa Stats Huya        RISING](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/huya.com)\n\nvs\n\n[Alexa Stats Douyu   FADING](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/douyu.com)\n\nThrough out history Huya makes more money with less and their popularity is climbing while Douyu is falling.  In reality though this is like comparing ABC/CBS/NBC to each other in the 80-90s  they will probably ebb and flow as the domestic market changes what they are in to. Huya though has consistently shown they MAKE MORE MONEY WITH LESS and MAKE EVEN MORE MONEY WITH MORE.  The people in charge on this company are smart and make the right choices.  Unfortunately they haven\u2019t been able to reap the rewards of this work. (That changes this week)\n\nWith what people currently know RIGHT NOW.\n\nHuya should trade at $41.81 if we valued the company from it\u2019s KNOWN MRQ.  Why doesn\u2019t it trade in the $40s?\n\n1. Chinese stocks have traditionally been undervalued by US investors for good and bad reasons. The biggest reason though is investors can\u2019t trust a lot of the numbers that we see as we have no baseline for reference and the Chinese market is obfuscated.  What we do know though says that Huya is undervalued RIGHT NOW.\n2. Huya has had a history of epic bad timing.  It\u2019s the unfortunate thing about being a foreign company that is traded on another countries stock exchange.  Often you get compounded negatives.  Those negatives are further compounded by it\u2019s NYSE listing that doesn\u2019t give the same bump to tech stocks like the NASDAQ does.  Huya\u2019s share price has been epically suppressed by outside forces.  It\u2019s a spring at full compression ready to release.\n\nWe will discuss below.\n\nHuya would be on a 2 year Bull run but it didn\u2019t suffer from bad timing.  Here are some graphs to illustrate this position.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7u3fSD8](https://imgur.com/a/7u3fSD8)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/HYynPTP](https://imgur.com/a/HYynPTP)\n\nThese are the overlays of Huya and the S&amp;P 500. Top is all time and bottom is about 10 months.  This is important for scale.  Huya would have been on a Bull Run since December of 2018 but world politics have kept it down.\n\nKey Suppressions\n\n1. March, May, August 2019\n\nTrump fired up his Trade war with a March 2019 Deadline.  Huya was able to stave off the pain until April because it CRUSHED earnings early March but eventually even awesome earnings couldn\u2019t keep it\u2019s stock price up. Notice S&amp;P Dips in May and August.  These was all Chinese \u201cTrade War\u201d uncertainty and they affected Chinese Stocks BIGLY.  Huya kept getting knocked down just as it was rising each of these affect were amplified by it being on the NYSE\n\n2. October 2019\n\nU.S. Commerce Department targeted companies that had human rights violations Huya wasn\u2019t one of these companies but anything bad for China has been in the past bad for Huya.  Huya doesn\u2019t have an identity inside the US market so it is just generically hurt when something bad happens to China and is generically hurt when something bad happens in the US.  For example BABA wasn\u2019t hurt so much by many of these China disruptions because US investors can wrap their hands around BABA a little better IMO.\n\n**THIS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE**\n\n3. December 2019\n\nCorona Virus hits China.  This hammers Huya which is unfortunate.  It should have actually done the opposite.  Americans will understand this if they have followed Chegg, Zoom, Twilio Etc Etc\n\n4. February 2020\n\nCorona Virus jitters hit the US.  This once again Hammers Huya.  (It Shouldn\u2019t)\n\n5.  March 2020\n\nUS Shutdown. Same story. Hammers Huya but should have done the opposite.\n\n6.  May 13th and 14th\n\nLast week Huya is just beginning to RIP but once again it\u2019s trading is affected by US domestic issues.  Lows on these days match the lows of the S&amp;P 500.  Huya has had decreased volume recently because the eyeballs in the US market are elsewhere and with that lower volume it is more sensitive to changes in the broader market.  **THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE**\n\nIn part 1.  We learned that Huya should be trading at $41.81 RIGHT NOW (If it traded at MRQ instead of Market cap, LoL See MELI)  based on what we know about it and if you removed broader market issues that have affected Huya\u2019s stock price negatively.\n\nWe are now at a Stock Price of $41.81\n\n**WE HAVEN\u2019T EVEN GOT TO THE GOOD PART YET**\n\nOne of the reasons Huya hasn\u2019t been viewed as positively as some of the MANY other streaming plays in Asia is while even though they have been posting some AWESOME earnings people felt like they could do more.  At odd times they seemed to have set guidance lower than expected. Americans assumed they were sandbagging so they can beat expectations.  Cheap win to raise the stock price.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t what was going on. HUYA has been in the lab working on WORLD DOMINATION and all the work and hard knocks are about to pay off.\n\nLet me introduce Americans to [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) the GREATEST MONEY MAKING APP OF ALL TIME.  This thing is going to be a juggernaut and it is JUST GETTING STARTED\n\nIt already has more active participation than Twitch.  This is absolute crazy sauce.\n\nTo get an idea how crazy this is TWITCH is the #32 website on the entire Internet according to Alexa\n\n[Alexa Stats TWITCH](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/twitch.tv)\n\nNimo is #4400 and just started climbing.  We left base camp an hour ago.\n\n[Alexa STATS Nimo.TV](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/nimo.tv)\n\nThink about this for a second. Let\u2019s lop off the last number and use a basketball analogy. The Number #3 team in the nation is getting dunked on by the number 440 team in the nation. The women's UMBC basketball team is beating Virginia.\n\nHow is this possible?  This can\u2019t be true?  This is one of the things that have depressed Huya\u2019s stock price.  It\u2019s hard to believe their numbers.  So I did some DD\n\nMany of my kids are gamers.  We spent 2 nights this week playing around with [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV)\n\nI expected them to dump on it because my teenage kids are at the hater age and my younger ones just go with the flow.\n\nThey were stunned. LOVED IT.  I learned some things about it. Many of the games being streamed are not PC games. They are Mobile games.  A lot of the big streamers are using a keyboard and mouse hooked up to their smart phones.  The important part here is the cost of entry for new customers is low. Many Second/Third world countries have the infrastructure to support broadband connections and people there have adequate phones in their pockets and lots of them have phones that are just as powerful as a desktop computer in the US just a few years ago.\n\nThere are 3.5 BILLION smart phones in the world and NIMO integrates them as well as desktops.  The ceiling on this is HUGE.  Seriously the biggest ceiling I have ever seen on a product.\n\nMy kids loved the website and it was popping.  We spent hours on it having a good time.  The genius of it though is the business model.  Streamers are essentially Independent Contractors it looks like. They make money via Diamond Tips that are bought by the viewers.  Unlike the US where our privacy is the product and the media is free.  Most of the world they make you pay to use stuff.  90% of NIMO revenues come from these fees.  No advertising downturns and essentially the talent works on commission.  If you\u2019ve ever worked in sales you will immediately recognize why this is an awesome business model.  Some of these streamers are making bank and you can count up their diamonds.  Even low end streamers get revenue.  The business model is a tread mill. GENIUS\n\nIt was POPPING so POPPING I suspected it wasn\u2019t legit.  NIMO has more ACTIVE VIEWERS than it\u2019s American version that is the Number 32 website in all the internet.\n\nHas to be fake right?\n\nIT\u2019S NOT and it\u2019s gob smacking.  This is just the beginning.  We are at the bottom of the ramp and this ramp is the most distributed and balanced money making machine that has ever been created.\n\nThe world of NIMO where the numbers are crazy and can\u2019t be true. BUT THEY ARE.  Nimo\u2019s business model encourages it\u2019s users to promote their channel.  This thing is gaining traction in 12+ countries, Big Ones and it\u2019s only getting bigger.  Crazy levels of engagement.  Stuff you can\u2019t fake.  Let\u2019s start with NIMO official Social Media Channels\n\nInstagram (Not even a complete list this is just highlights)\n\n[Latin America](https://www.instagram.com/nimotv_latam)\n\n[Argentina](https://www.instagram.com/argonotoficial/)\n\n[Brazil](https://www.instagram.com/nimotv_brasil/)\n\n[Indonesia](https://www.instagram.com/nimotv_id/)\n\nThere are TONS of individual streamers with 6 figure followers on social media\n\n[One of MANY 100k Streamers](https://www.instagram.com/drspeedytv/)\n\nPsiko \u2013 Love this dude, Moroccan and I guess speaks Arabic, dude is crushing it in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait etc etc. He is quickly becoming the most famous person in Morocco and his fame comes from the rich countries in the Middle East.

There are DOZENS and DOZENS of streamers with 6 figure followers just in Brazil. Their will be 100 of them by the end of summer. An ARMY OF PROMOTION that you can\u2019t even buy if you wanted to.\n\n[700K Brazil](https://www.instagram.com/hudsonamorim1/)\n\n100K Thailand\n\n[100K Thailand](https://www.instagram.com/ninjotv/)\n\n330K something Arabic\n\n[300K Arabic](https://www.instagram.com/7chich/)\n\nHundreds of dudes like this\n\n[100s of dudes like this with Facebook Pages](https://www.facebook.com/newx2018/)\n\nEven Girls, I could post 300 links like this.  THIS IS AN ARMY IN THE MAKING\n\n[Girl Streamers as well](https://www.facebook.com/jajarkawaii/)\n\nNIMO is always popping on Twitter and depending on the time of day you can see what countries are in peak usage as the language of the Tweets shift.\n\n[Twitter is always popping for NIMO](https://twitter.com/search?q=Nimo&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live)\n\nLikes and Followers can be faked.  What is hard to fake is the engagement.  Read the comments on these dudes. Armies of 12-25 year olds follow and interact with them and every one of them has their [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) link in their profiles.  They are becoming legit celebrities with people YOU KNOW wanting to take pictures with them.  This is the future.\n\n[NIMO is just getting started APP statistics](https://sensortower.com/android/BR/nimo-tv/app/nimo-tv-live-de-streaming-de-jogos/com.huya.nimo/overview?selected_tab=reviews)\n\nOver 2 million downloads a month right now and has grown exponentially in the past 6 months.  It\u2019s going to be at 10 million a month by the Fall AND THIS ISN\u2019T EVEN STREAMING SEASON YET. May is actually the lowest month traditionally for streamers.\n\nFYI from my research only 1 month in Q1 had the increased traffic that Nimo has benefited from on the books and unlike much of the broad internet market it has retained and INCREASED it\u2019s coronavirus bump.  The seed for Nimo\u2019s success had already been planted. Corona was just the fertilizer.  This means whatever Q1 is Q2 is going to blow it out of the water.\n\nGive you an idea of what kind of valuations one is to place on this kind of heat.\n\n[If Mixer paid $20 Million for Ninja they should have just paid $20 Billion for Nimo](https://mixer.com/browse/all)\n\nMixer payed a streamer called Ninja $20 million plus a year to move to their platform.\n\nMixer currently has less users than [Nimo.Tv](https://Nimo.Tv)\u2019s 25th country.  Nimo has presence all over the world with top and bottom hemispheres.  This is important because it balances the seasonality of profits and bandwidth distribution.  Nimo is seriously set up to be the most stable and distributed profit machine the world has ever seen.\n\nRemember when we discussed that Huya was the most profitable Chinese streaming company despite it being the 3rd in size? IMAGINE HOW MUCH IT IS GOING TO MAKE WITH THIS JUGGERNAUT\n\nAlso the PPP of the countries that it is gaining traction in are mostly HIGHER than China and Brazils is only marginally lesser and statistically very similar.  This answers the question about profitability in foreign countries. Their profits should be the same or greater because the average PPP in the countries it is currently in should be higher than China.  Since it\u2019s distributed to many cultures it will also weather the changes in usage because of trends.  Myspace didn\u2019t have the luxury of revenue from Germany when it started losing users in the US. [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) can and it is on it\u2019s way to becoming the 800lb gorilla in a lot of these markets while domestically Huya had to claw it\u2019s way from the bottom.  I have never been more impressed with a companies trajectory and decision making over it\u2019s first few years than I have with Huya.\n\nThe reason why Huya adjusted guidance was not to sand bag as many suspected.  It was because they were cooking up the Killer App of all Killer apps\n\nIf [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) was a stand alone company it could be worth MORE than Huya but for evaluation purposes we will say that it is worth the same.\n\nBased on what we KNOW about Huya the MRQ justifies a $41.81 share price if [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) is worth that right now we should be valuing Huya at $83.62.  $41.81 x2 and in reality even more as [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) has been a parasite on Huya for the past 2 years and is just now beginning to bring in revenue and because of corona it was perfect timing to capitalize and EXPLODE.\n\nAt $83.62 with 67 Million outstanding shares we have a valuation of $5.61 Billion (Market Cap) for the most profitable streaming company in China that is trending up (Douyu @$2.41B for example is trending down and worth double of Huya currently) Huya is on the pathway to becoming the most popular domestic platform and at the very least number 2 (It\u2019s already Tops in profit).  To be honest a 2.8 Billion Market Cap is UNDERVALUED for the Chinese properties.  It\u2019s MRQ has suffered because Huya has been financing it\u2019s rollout of Nimo for the past 2 years.\n\nWe are now at the Stock Price $83.62\n\nBUT WE HAVEN\u2019T EVEN GOT TO THE GOOD PART YET.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about value.\n\nWHY IS HUYA SO UNDERVALUED?  Timing, Politics and Trust\n\nHuya can\u2019t help it\u2019s timing.  It just got dumped on chronologically because of many things outside it\u2019s control, Politics becomes less of an issue the bigger and more recognizable you get.  That\u2019s why BABA, BIDU and soon JD fluctuate less when bad China news happens. They still fluctuate but less and rebound faster.  The world is about to find out about HUYA and it will receive the same benefit.  Trust,  When I started my research on Chinese companies I came into this as a skeptic.  PDD, IQ, Doyu and others. I looked at them all and I was trying to find things that didn\u2019t smell right and were possibly faked.  We hear all the time about Chinese companies and their shenanigans.  Huya seemed to be totally legit and I believe all of their Chinese numbers are legit.  I can\u2019t really verify a lot of it because of the Great Firewall of China and the nature of the closed Chinese Internet.\n\nWe can however verify a lot of the Metrics on [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) and the gas pedal has been slammed to the floor on this property and it has just gotten started.\n\nSo what is Huya actually worth?\n\n[SE $19 Billion Market Cap](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-SE/)\n\n$19.4 Billion 313.9 Million shares $61.96 share price\n\nThis is SEA.  They make stuff like Garena Free Fire and mobile games.  They are a revenue monster but like many internet companies not super profitable (Unlike Huya) they have a $19B valuation.  Why? Well the company does have legit potential but it has avoided a lot of the blows that Huya got because it\u2019s based in Singapore which has a positive relationship with the US and the openness of it\u2019s internet allows for more scrutiny of it\u2019s operations.  It\u2019s worth this because of it\u2019s revenue and it\u2019s POTENTIAL to be as profitable as a company like HUYA has already proven it can do.  Huya is worth MORE than SE because SE\u2019s value is dependent on it\u2019s properties.  Most things don\u2019t have minecraft levels of sustained enthusiasm and good companies can still release good products that don\u2019t get traction in the market place (See Gameboy Micro) Huya makes profits off of the labors of companies like SE and if SE falters there will be another product to replace it.\n\nHuya will have SE levels of revenue or more this year AND Huya levels of profitability. Remember Q1 2020 only has 1 month of the needle being pegged and it takes awhile for new users to start paying and understanding the platform.  Whatever increases in Q1 I suspect double or more of that will happen in Q2\n\nIf Huya was valued like SE by obtaining similar revenue levels (and it should be more as it\u2019s super profitable) It would be trading at $290+\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOW FOR THE GOOD PART\u2026\u2026  Everything you have read to this point are Third and Second Place when it comes to the valuation of Huya\n\n[DKNG $20 Billion Market Cap](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-DKNG/)\n\n$29.23 Share Price 20.6B Market Cap 705 Million Shares\n\nThis is Draft Kings. They are an American gambling website.  The US market for Sports Gambling is about $880 Million and Projected to be up to $8 Billion in 5 years\n\nSports Gambling Worldwide is about a $110 Billion enterprise of both legal and illegal gambling. So Draft Kings is worth $20.6 Billion RIGHT NOW because of it\u2019s POTENTIAL to have a piece of an $8 Billion Industry (Maybe in 5 years) What do you think DKNG\u2019s market share will be?  Even if it\u2019s 30% (Optimistic) we are talking about $2 Billion in revenue in 5 years.  Watching sports on TV is going the way of the Digital Camera, rear wheel drive sedan and the Travel Agent.  In five years these 17-22 year olds watching Nimo will be 22-27 making money and playing video games.  They won\u2019t be using Draft Kings. As big as esports are to watch (It\u2019s legit big with massive tournaments in places like the Staples Center and Prize money in the millions with endorsements from companies as big as Honda) there is even MORE money in esports gambling.\n\nEsports Gambling is a $15 Billion Dollar Industry RIGHT NOW.  If American Sports gambling is going to grow from $800 million to $8 Billion over the next 5 years how big will the esports gambling market be just in the US? How big worldwide?  At some point esports will overtake Sports Gambling just like the Smart phone overtook the Digital Camera Market.  I personally predict that in 7 years esports gambling will overtake Sports Gambling\n\nDKNG is worth $20 Billion and part of an Industry that is 1/20th the size of the esports gambling industry RIGHT NOW.  It\u2019s entire platform is centered around just gambling. Huya hasn\u2019t even tapped that part of their market and the portion they are eating is currently 20x larger.\n\nBrazil is one of the countries Nimo is booming in and Brazil is also a country with lots of Sports Gamblers.  Bet365 is in the Top 50 websites in Brazil for Internet Traffic\n\nWHY IS THIS IMPORTANT\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/zMrZHco](https://imgur.com/a/zMrZHco)\n\nHidden in the Nimo App is this little nugget, Huya has spent the last couple years cooking up and rolling out the Killer App [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) that could possibly be one of the most profitable Internet properties ever and they are about to pour gasoline on that fire.\n\nMY ADVICE if you have any positions in any of their competitors. SELL IT AND BUY HUYA  If you have stock in MELI SELL IT AND BUY HUYA if you have DKNG SELL HALF AND BUY HUYA if you have SPCE SELL IT AND BUY HUYA\n\nBUY HUYA.  It\u2019s possibly the most undervalued stock ever.  It\u2019s not going to be a secret much longer.  Tick Tock time is running out, Earnings are Wednesday evening and if what I suspect is right it is going to be an EPIC GAP UP\n\nSynopsis\n\nHuya is the most under valued stock in the past 50 years.

I suspect this was made by a computer.  GIGO\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/EfoFbKl](https://imgur.com/a/EfoFbKl)\n\nA human would know that the previous 12 months of this crayon drawing isn't actually flat.  A base was being built with which Huya is going to launch from after it reports earnings.  I count back at least 12 months worth of outside of Huya's control market disruptions.  That's why Huya has traded flat for probably 18 months of it's existence if you looks at the numbers with no context.  These price targets aren't for 12 months in the future it's for 6 months in the past AND Huya is straight killing it.\n\nHow much is a company worth that punches up domestically and then goes on a rampage of worldwide domination in markets that speak 20+ different languages with an army of of their target audience talking about it everywhere?\n\nIF DKNG is worth $20 Billion for a chance to get a PIECE of an $8 Billion market in five years how much is a company that is in a position to eat half the watermelon or more of a $15 Billion dollar market RIGHT NOW?\n\nSE is worth $19 Billion and doesn't have the balance sheet of Huya.

A bunch of these launched 4-5 years or so ago and just like in the US they ran up as people jockeyed for position in companies that would one day might be successful.  Winners and losers were picked based on guesses, tea leaves and the statistics of young companies just trying to get traction.\n\nWhile researching many of these companies one (HUYA) caught my eye as they moved their earnings up 1 month.  Companies don\u2019t rush to tell people bad news. Here is the results of my research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHuya $1.15B Market Cap $17.13 Share Price NYSE\n\nEnterprise Value MRQ = $2.8B\n\n67.1 Million Shares Class A (The small amount of shares will amplify this rocketship)\n\n[Huya NYSE](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-HUYA/)\n\nConsidered the 3rd place streaming company by American Investors.  The reality though is it\u2019s number 2 and rising fast when viewed in the macro.  It started in 3rd place in American minds because of it's size, it was started in the 3rd biggest city though and had less to do with the other companies being more successful. Has much better business model and analytics compared to it\u2019s competitors.  One of the many reasons it\u2019s price is suppressed was being listed on NYSE and not NASDAQ like it\u2019s competitors. NYSE has been more negative for Chinese stocks and less sympathetic to tech compared to NASDAQ. Sometimes it\u2019s the little things that are actually big. Currently 12.5% shorted but was as high as 74% on 5/11\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost similar competitor\n\nDoyu  $2.41B Market Cap $7.60 Share Price NASDAQ\n\nEnterprise Value MRQ = $1.7B\n\n317.4 million Shares\n\n[Doyu NASDAQ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-DOYU/)\n\nConsidered the top Publicly Traded Chinese Game Streaming Company by Americans.  Has VERY FEW metrics that are better than Huya and has basically capitalized by taking early mindshare during the exploratory run up and less price suppression due to it being listed on NASDAQ. All the stats it beats Huya on are garbage stats that don\u2019t really mean much.\n\nFrom the jump we can tell that Huya is currently worth over DOUBLE what it trades for with just a cursory glance of the information above.  Let\u2019s talk about this awesome company that is about to take a rocket ship up.\n\nHuya has been working in the lab to become one of the most profitable companies that have EVER EXISTED.  We will discuss this in 3 parts\n\n1. Chinese Domestic Market =  One of the problems with evaluating Chinese companies is the West doesn\u2019t always trust their numbers.   Because of the closed nature of the Chinese Internet and language barriers it is hard for western investors to get a good grip on what is going on.  A lot of the numbers look crazy and Chinese companies in the past have used fake numbers and continue the fakery until they collapse.  This is a contributing factor to HUYA price suppression.\n\nThe video Game Live Streaming Market in China is maturing.  These companies are often called the \u201cTwitch\u201d of China.  In reality they are more like a hybrid of Only Fans, Twitch and ESPN or CBS\n\nLive Streaming is still their bread and butter\n\nTwitch Type Stuff with Gamers\n\n[Twitch type stuff with Gamers](https://www.huya.com/520jiege)\n\nOnly Fans Stuff but probably PG Rated\n\n[Only Fans type stuff but PG rated](https://www.huya.com/5920)\n\nLooks like there is even room for some men to livestream to girls or Chinese Gays.  Who knows\n\n[Livestreamers male and female](https://www.huya.com/g/4079)\n\nThe market is putting more emphasis towards live esports content. (Remember this for part 3)  Like ESPN of video games. This is happening in America as well, Professional sports have an EPIC problem on their hands.  12-24 year olds are starting to NOT WATCH ball and bat sports, they watch  ESPORTS.  Even jocks do this.  Professional sports are going to start to see a YOY erosion of viewership in the next 5 years.\n\nANYONE WHO HAS A TEEN RIGHT NOW CAN PROBABLY VERIFY THIS\n\n[This is the Future, Live Streamed eSports events](https://www.huya.com/2020cfpl)\n\nHuya just signed a bunch of exclusive content deals to secure the streaming rights of major tournaments.  The best western example of this I can give is CBS locking up March Madness and we know what a cash cow that is in America.  Huya is going to be the dominate player for future online esports content.\n\nThe Super Bowl, NBA Finals, World Series as we know it is DYING.  The writing is on the wall and it\u2019s just a matter of time. Do you want to be in on the switch NOW or once the rest of America figures it out?\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/9D1poyj](https://imgur.com/a/9D1poyj)\n\nAbove is a graph showing traffic to the Huya website.  Note the flat line for 5 months and then on the 6th the climb starts (Just 1 month of increased traffic will be on Q1 earnings FYI)  This can be attributed to Huya rolling out it\u2019s plan to be the destination for esports viewership.\n\nHuya has always made the most money pound for pound of any streaming platform in Asia. Their business model is just better.  90% of their revenues comes from the users themselves tipping their favorite streamers with virtual thingamajigs.  The system works and Huya has been able to consistently show some of the best profits.  They have been very smart over the past few years plowing said profits into future operations to the detriment of their share price.  Domestically they used these profits for securing rights so they can shift into a global media player. I\u2019d imagine that in the future Huya sees themselves as the ESPN of China with the twitch thing on the side because it is a cash cow. (Much the same way Netflix still does physical DVD\u2019s.  (It STILL makes fat stacks of cash by old economy standards)\n\nDomestically Huya is the BEST Live Stream play and they prove it with the $$$ but you can also see the stats.  Huya makes more money per on it\u2019s traffic vs competitors and it\u2019s not even close.\n\nAlso domestically things are shifting.  Doyu is falling off and Huya continues to grow and find more audience, better stats and more money. It\u2019s got better stats and better profits than it\u2019s competitor who has double the market cap.  Huya is the king of bad timing (Outside Forces) when it comes to their value and is ahead of the curve when it comes to preparing for the future.\n\nYou can compare some of the stats here\n\n[Alexa Stats Huya        RISING](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/huya.com)\n\nvs\n\n[Alexa Stats Douyu   FADING](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/douyu.com)\n\nThrough out history Huya makes more money with less and their popularity is climbing while Douyu is falling.  In reality though this is like comparing ABC/CBS/NBC to each other in the 80-90s  they will probably ebb and flow as the domestic market changes what they are in to. Huya though has consistently shown they MAKE MORE MONEY WITH LESS and MAKE EVEN MORE MONEY WITH MORE.  The people in charge on this company are smart and make the right choices.  Unfortunately they haven\u2019t been able to reap the rewards of this work. (That changes this week)\n\nWith what people currently know RIGHT NOW.\n\nHuya should trade at $41.81 if we valued the company from it\u2019s KNOWN MRQ.  Why doesn\u2019t it trade in the $40s?\n\n1. Chinese stocks have traditionally been undervalued by US investors for good and bad reasons. The biggest reason though is investors can\u2019t trust a lot of the numbers that we see as we have no baseline for reference and the Chinese market is obfuscated.  What we do know though says that Huya is undervalued RIGHT NOW.\n2. Huya has had a history of epic bad timing.  It\u2019s the unfortunate thing about being a foreign company that is traded on another countries stock exchange.  Often you get compounded negatives.  Those negatives are further compounded by it\u2019s NYSE listing that doesn\u2019t give the same bump to tech stocks like the NASDAQ does.  Huya\u2019s share price has been epically suppressed by outside forces.  It\u2019s a spring at full compression ready to release.\n\nWe will discuss below.\n\nHuya would be on a 2 year Bull run but it didn\u2019t suffer from bad timing.  Here are some graphs to illustrate this position.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7u3fSD8](https://imgur.com/a/7u3fSD8)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/HYynPTP](https://imgur.com/a/HYynPTP)\n\nThese are the overlays of Huya and the S&amp;P 500. Top is all time and bottom is about 10 months.  This is important for scale.  Huya would have been on a Bull Run since December of 2018 but world politics have kept it down.\n\nKey Suppressions\n\n1. March, May, August 2019\n\nTrump fired up his Trade war with a March 2019 Deadline.  Huya was able to stave off the pain until April because it CRUSHED earnings early March but eventually even awesome earnings couldn\u2019t keep it\u2019s stock price up. Notice S&amp;P Dips in May and August.  These was all Chinese \u201cTrade War\u201d uncertainty and they affected Chinese Stocks BIGLY.  Huya kept getting knocked down just as it was rising each of these affect were amplified by it being on the NYSE\n\n2. October 2019\n\nU.S. Commerce Department targeted companies that had human rights violations Huya wasn\u2019t one of these companies but anything bad for China has been in the past bad for Huya.  Huya doesn\u2019t have an identity inside the US market so it is just generically hurt when something bad happens to China and is generically hurt when something bad happens in the US.  For example BABA wasn\u2019t hurt so much by many of these China disruptions because US investors can wrap their hands around BABA a little better IMO.\n\n**THIS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE**\n\n3. December 2019\n\nCorona Virus hits China.  This hammers Huya which is unfortunate.  It should have actually done the opposite.  Americans will understand this if they have followed Chegg, Zoom, Twilio Etc Etc\n\n4. February 2020\n\nCorona Virus jitters hit the US.  This once again Hammers Huya.  (It Shouldn\u2019t)\n\n5.  March 2020\n\nUS Shutdown. Same story. Hammers Huya but should have done the opposite.\n\n6.  May 13th and 14th\n\nLast week Huya is just beginning to RIP but once again it\u2019s trading is affected by US domestic issues.  Lows on these days match the lows of the S&amp;P 500.  Huya has had decreased volume recently because the eyeballs in the US market are elsewhere and with that lower volume it is more sensitive to changes in the broader market.  **THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE**\n\nIn part 1.  We learned that Huya should be trading at $41.81 RIGHT NOW (If it traded at MRQ instead of Market cap, LoL See MELI)  based on what we know about it and if you removed broader market issues that have affected Huya\u2019s stock price negatively.\n\nWe are now at a Stock Price of $41.81\n\n**WE HAVEN\u2019T EVEN GOT TO THE GOOD PART YET**\n\nOne of the reasons Huya hasn\u2019t been viewed as positively as some of the MANY other streaming plays in Asia is while even though they have been posting some AWESOME earnings people felt like they could do more.  At odd times they seemed to have set guidance lower than expected. Americans assumed they were sandbagging so they can beat expectations.  Cheap win to raise the stock price.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t what was going on. HUYA has been in the lab working on WORLD DOMINATION and all the work and hard knocks are about to pay off.\n\nLet me introduce Americans to [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) the GREATEST MONEY MAKING APP OF ALL TIME.  This thing is going to be a juggernaut and it is JUST GETTING STARTED\n\nIt already has more active participation than Twitch.  This is absolute crazy sauce.\n\nTo get an idea how crazy this is TWITCH is the #32 website on the entire Internet according to Alexa\n\n[Alexa Stats TWITCH](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/twitch.tv)\n\nNimo is #4400 and just started climbing.  We left base camp an hour ago.\n\n[Alexa STATS Nimo.TV](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/nimo.tv)\n\nThink about this for a second. Let\u2019s lop off the last number and use a basketball analogy. The Number #3 team in the nation is getting dunked on by the number 440 team in the nation. The women's UMBC basketball team is beating Virginia.\n\nHow is this possible?  This can\u2019t be true?  This is one of the things that have depressed Huya\u2019s stock price.  It\u2019s hard to believe their numbers.  So I did some DD\n\nMany of my kids are gamers.  We spent 2 nights this week playing around with [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV)\n\nI expected them to dump on it because my teenage kids are at the hater age and my younger ones just go with the flow.\n\nThey were stunned. LOVED IT.  I learned some things about it. Many of the games being streamed are not PC games. They are Mobile games.  A lot of the big streamers are using a keyboard and mouse hooked up to their smart phones.  The important part here is the cost of entry for new customers is low. Many Second/Third world countries have the infrastructure to support broadband connections and people there have adequate phones in their pockets and lots of them have phones that are just as powerful as a desktop computer in the US just a few years ago.\n\nThere are 3.5 BILLION smart phones in the world and NIMO integrates them as well as desktops.  The ceiling on this is HUGE.  Seriously the biggest ceiling I have ever seen on a product.\n\nMy kids loved the website and it was popping.  We spent hours on it having a good time.  The genius of it though is the business model.  Streamers are essentially Independent Contractors it looks like. They make money via Diamond Tips that are bought by the viewers.  Unlike the US where our privacy is the product and the media is free.  Most of the world they make you pay to use stuff.  90% of NIMO revenues come from these fees.  No advertising downturns and essentially the talent works on commission.  If you\u2019ve ever worked in sales you will immediately recognize why this is an awesome business model.  Some of these streamers are making bank and you can count up their diamonds.  Even low end streamers get revenue.  The business model is a tread mill. GENIUS\n\nIt was POPPING so POPPING I suspected it wasn\u2019t legit.  NIMO has more ACTIVE VIEWERS than it\u2019s American version that is the Number 32 website in all the internet.\n\nHas to be fake right?\n\nIT\u2019S NOT and it\u2019s gob smacking.  This is just the beginning.  We are at the bottom of the ramp and this ramp is the most distributed and balanced money making machine that has ever been created.\n\nThe world of NIMO where the numbers are crazy and can\u2019t be true. BUT THEY ARE.  Nimo\u2019s business model encourages it\u2019s users to promote their channel.  This thing is gaining traction in 12+ countries, Big Ones and it\u2019s only getting bigger.  Crazy levels of engagement.  Stuff you can\u2019t fake.  Let\u2019s start with NIMO official Social Media Channels\n\nInstagram (Not even a complete list this is just highlights)\n\n[Latin America](https://www.instagram.com/nimotv_latam)\n\n[Argentina](https://www.instagram.com/argonotoficial/)\n\n[Brazil](https://www.instagram.com/nimotv_brasil/)\n\n[Indonesia](https://www.instagram.com/nimotv_id/)\n\nThere are TONS of individual streamers with 6 figure followers on social media\n\n[One of MANY 100k Streamers](https://www.instagram.com/drspeedytv/)\n\nPsiko \u2013 Love this dude, Moroccan and I guess speaks Arabic, dude is crushing it in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait etc etc. He is quickly becoming the most famous person in Morocco and his fame comes from the rich countries in the Middle East.

THIS IS AN ARMY IN THE MAKING\n\n[Girl Streamers as well](https://www.facebook.com/jajarkawaii/)\n\nNIMO is always popping on Twitter and depending on the time of day you can see what countries are in peak usage as the language of the Tweets shift.\n\n[Twitter is always popping for NIMO](https://twitter.com/search?q=Nimo&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live)\n\nLikes and Followers can be faked.  What is hard to fake is the engagement.  Read the comments on these dudes. Armies of 12-25 year olds follow and interact with them and every one of them has their [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) link in their profiles.  They are becoming legit celebrities with people YOU KNOW wanting to take pictures with them.  This is the future.\n\n[NIMO is just getting started APP statistics](https://sensortower.com/android/BR/nimo-tv/app/nimo-tv-live-de-streaming-de-jogos/com.huya.nimo/overview?selected_tab=reviews)\n\nOver 2 million downloads a month right now and has grown exponentially in the past 6 months.  It\u2019s going to be at 10 million a month by the Fall AND THIS ISN\u2019T EVEN STREAMING SEASON YET. May is actually the lowest month traditionally for streamers.\n\nFYI from my research only 1 month in Q1 had the increased traffic that Nimo has benefited from on the books and unlike much of the broad internet market it has retained and INCREASED it\u2019s coronavirus bump.  The seed for Nimo\u2019s success had already been planted. Corona was just the fertilizer.  This means whatever Q1 is Q2 is going to blow it out of the water.\n\nGive you an idea of what kind of valuations one is to place on this kind of heat.\n\n[If Mixer paid $20 Million for Ninja they should have just paid $20 Billion for Nimo](https://mixer.com/browse/all)\n\nMixer payed a streamer called Ninja $20 million plus a year to move to their platform.\n\nMixer currently has less users than [Nimo.Tv](https://Nimo.Tv)\u2019s 25th country.  Nimo has presence all over the world with top and bottom hemispheres.  This is important because it balances the seasonality of profits and bandwidth distribution.  Nimo is seriously set up to be the most stable and distributed profit machine the world has ever seen.\n\nRemember when we discussed that Huya was the most profitable Chinese streaming company despite it being the 3rd in size? IMAGINE HOW MUCH IT IS GOING TO MAKE WITH THIS JUGGERNAUT\n\nAlso the PPP of the countries that it is gaining traction in are mostly HIGHER than China and Brazils is only marginally lesser and statistically very similar.  This answers the question about profitability in foreign countries. Their profits should be the same or greater because the average PPP in the countries it is currently in should be higher than China.  Since it\u2019s distributed to many cultures it will also weather the changes in usage because of trends.  Myspace didn\u2019t have the luxury of revenue from Germany when it started losing users in the US. [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) can and it is on it\u2019s way to becoming the 800lb gorilla in a lot of these markets while domestically Huya had to claw it\u2019s way from the bottom.  I have never been more impressed with a companies trajectory and decision making over it\u2019s first few years than I have with Huya.\n\nThe reason why Huya adjusted guidance was not to sand bag as many suspected.  It was because they were cooking up the Killer App of all Killer apps\n\nIf [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) was a stand alone company it could be worth MORE than Huya but for evaluation purposes we will say that it is worth the same.\n\nBased on what we KNOW about Huya the MRQ justifies a $41.81 share price if [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) is worth that right now we should be valuing Huya at $83.62.  $41.81 x2 and in reality even more as [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) has been a parasite on Huya for the past 2 years and is just now beginning to bring in revenue and because of corona it was perfect timing to capitalize and EXPLODE.\n\nAt $83.62 with 67 Million outstanding shares we have a valuation of $5.61 Billion (Market Cap) for the most profitable streaming company in China that is trending up (Douyu @$2.41B for example is trending down and worth double of Huya currently) Huya is on the pathway to becoming the most popular domestic platform and at the very least number 2 (It\u2019s already Tops in profit).  To be honest a 2.8 Billion Market Cap is UNDERVALUED for the Chinese properties.  It\u2019s MRQ has suffered because Huya has been financing it\u2019s rollout of Nimo for the past 2 years.\n\nWe are now at the Stock Price $83.62\n\nBUT WE HAVEN\u2019T EVEN GOT TO THE GOOD PART YET.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about value.\n\nWHY IS HUYA SO UNDERVALUED?  Timing, Politics and Trust\n\nHuya can\u2019t help it\u2019s timing.  It just got dumped on chronologically because of many things outside it\u2019s control, Politics becomes less of an issue the bigger and more recognizable you get.  That\u2019s why BABA, BIDU and soon JD fluctuate less when bad China news happens. They still fluctuate but less and rebound faster.  The world is about to find out about HUYA and it will receive the same benefit.  Trust,  When I started my research on Chinese companies I came into this as a skeptic.  PDD, IQ, Doyu and others. I looked at them all and I was trying to find things that didn\u2019t smell right and were possibly faked.  We hear all the time about Chinese companies and their shenanigans.  Huya seemed to be totally legit and I believe all of their Chinese numbers are legit.  I can\u2019t really verify a lot of it because of the Great Firewall of China and the nature of the closed Chinese Internet.\n\nWe can however verify a lot of the Metrics on [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) and the gas pedal has been slammed to the floor on this property and it has just gotten started.\n\nSo what is Huya actually worth?\n\n[SE $19 Billion Market Cap](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-SE/)\n\n$19.4 Billion 313.9 Million shares $61.96 share price\n\nThis is SEA.  They make stuff like Garena Free Fire and mobile games.  They are a revenue monster but like many internet companies not super profitable (Unlike Huya) they have a $19B valuation.  Why? Well the company does have legit potential but it has avoided a lot of the blows that Huya got because it\u2019s based in Singapore which has a positive relationship with the US and the openness of it\u2019s internet allows for more scrutiny of it\u2019s operations.  It\u2019s worth this because of it\u2019s revenue and it\u2019s POTENTIAL to be as profitable as a company like HUYA has already proven it can do.  Huya is worth MORE than SE because SE\u2019s value is dependent on it\u2019s properties.  Most things don\u2019t have minecraft levels of sustained enthusiasm and good companies can still release good products that don\u2019t get traction in the market place (See Gameboy Micro) Huya makes profits off of the labors of companies like SE and if SE falters there will be another product to replace it.\n\nHuya will have SE levels of revenue or more this year AND Huya levels of profitability. Remember Q1 2020 only has 1 month of the needle being pegged and it takes awhile for new users to start paying and understanding the platform.  Whatever increases in Q1 I suspect double or more of that will happen in Q2\n\nIf Huya was valued like SE by obtaining similar revenue levels (and it should be more as it\u2019s super profitable) It would be trading at $290+\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOW FOR THE GOOD PART\u2026\u2026  Everything you have read to this point are Third and Second Place when it comes to the valuation of Huya\n\n[DKNG $20 Billion Market Cap](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-DKNG/)\n\n$29.23 Share Price 20.6B Market Cap 705 Million Shares\n\nThis is Draft Kings. They are an American gambling website.  The US market for Sports Gambling is about $880 Million and Projected to be up to $8 Billion in 5 years\n\nSports Gambling Worldwide is about a $110 Billion enterprise of both legal and illegal gambling. So Draft Kings is worth $20.6 Billion RIGHT NOW because of it\u2019s POTENTIAL to have a piece of an $8 Billion Industry (Maybe in 5 years) What do you think DKNG\u2019s market share will be?  Even if it\u2019s 30% (Optimistic) we are talking about $2 Billion in revenue in 5 years.  Watching sports on TV is going the way of the Digital Camera, rear wheel drive sedan and the Travel Agent.  In five years these 17-22 year olds watching Nimo will be 22-27 making money and playing video games.  They won\u2019t be using Draft Kings. As big as esports are to watch (It\u2019s legit big with massive tournaments in places like the Staples Center and Prize money in the millions with endorsements from companies as big as Honda) there is even MORE money in esports gambling.\n\nEsports Gambling is a $15 Billion Dollar Industry RIGHT NOW.  If American Sports gambling is going to grow from $800 million to $8 Billion over the next 5 years how big will the esports gambling market be just in the US? How big worldwide?  At some point esports will overtake Sports Gambling just like the Smart phone overtook the Digital Camera Market.  I personally predict that in 7 years esports gambling will overtake Sports Gambling\n\nDKNG is worth $20 Billion and part of an Industry that is 1/20th the size of the esports gambling industry RIGHT NOW.  It\u2019s entire platform is centered around just gambling. Huya hasn\u2019t even tapped that part of their market and the portion they are eating is currently 20x larger.\n\nBrazil is one of the countries Nimo is booming in and Brazil is also a country with lots of Sports Gamblers.  Bet365 is in the Top 50 websites in Brazil for Internet Traffic\n\nWHY IS THIS IMPORTANT\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/zMrZHco](https://imgur.com/a/zMrZHco)\n\nHidden in the Nimo App is this little nugget, Huya has spent the last couple years cooking up and rolling out the Killer App [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) that could possibly be one of the most profitable Internet properties ever and they are about to pour gasoline on that fire.\n\nMY ADVICE if you have any positions in any of their competitors. SELL IT AND BUY HUYA  If you have stock in MELI SELL IT AND BUY HUYA if you have DKNG SELL HALF AND BUY HUYA if you have SPCE SELL IT AND BUY HUYA\n\nBUY HUYA.

A base was being built with which Huya is going to launch from after it reports earnings.  I count back at least 12 months worth of outside of Huya's control market disruptions.  That's why Huya has traded flat for probably 18 months of it's existence if you looks at the numbers with no context.  These price targets aren't for 12 months in the future it's for 6 months in the past AND Huya is straight killing it.\n\nHow much is a company worth that punches up domestically and then goes on a rampage of worldwide domination in markets that speak 20+ different languages with an army of of their target audience talking about it everywhere?\n\nIF DKNG is worth $20 Billion for a chance to get a PIECE of an $8 Billion market in five years how much is a company that is in a position to eat half the watermelon or more of a $15 Billion dollar market RIGHT NOW?\n\nSE is worth $19 Billion and doesn't have the balance sheet of Huya.

More data in the coming week may reveal how the housing market fared in April, after the economy abruptly fell off a cliff when states shut down their economies in the second half of March.\n*****\n&gt; Investors\u2019 focus will also be on the government stimulus programs to help the economy and markets get through the coronavirus crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appear before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, as it reviews the government\u2019s trillions in spending to help the economy, businesses and individuals. An interview with Powell will also air on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday night.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season is winding down but there are a number of reports from major retailers, like Walmart and Target, which should show that the big box stores and discounters are making out better than other retailers as consumers halted many discretionary purchases and moved more shopping online.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down nearly 2.3%, in its worst week since March 20. The S&amp;P ended at 2,863. The Dow was off about 2.6% for the week, in its worst week since April 3. It finished the week at 23,598. The Nasdaq also had its worst week since April 3.\n*****\n&gt; # Home sweet home\n&gt; \u201cHousing is going to be important in that you\u2019ll see the chilling effect that Covid has had on housing as well, less on construction than on sales, but on both,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chef economist at Grant Thornton. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be an issue. One of the key things we\u2019re watching going forward is the credit market and housing. There\u2019s been a real tightening of credit because of the servicers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said the mortgage servicers are caught in the middle between the banks and people who aren\u2019t making their payments. She said it has been impacting lending. \u201cThat\u2019s something we cannot afford. Housing was on a tear before, and it has to pull us out of this,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales were down 16.4% in April, and there was an unevenness of performance across the sector. The only positive category was online shopping, up 8.4%. Clothing and accessories, the types of things department stores sell, fell by 78.8% in April. Building materials and garden equipment were down just 3.5%, and that could help Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s which report earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarket reactions to the data have been somewhat muted,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. He said stocks on Friday were reacting negatively to threats from China that U.S. companies could be targeted if the U.S. does not ease up on Huawei. \u201cThe markets right now don\u2019t need another reason to be pessimistic. It seems like both the bond market and stock market are getting a little tired. Both markets are looking for the next catalyst.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Solvency concerns\n&gt; The Fed has been given generally high marks for keeping markets liquid, but analysts say they are now more worried about the solvency of companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting kind of threshold here as we\u2019re approaching three months stay at homes or shelter in place. We\u2019re moving from a liquidity challenge, which the Fed helped us address, to a solvency challenge,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief market strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said unpaid bills start to pile up and default rates rise on credit cards and mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe longer this goes on, the harder for folks to make those payments. That\u2019s why states are eager to open even if it has some risks,\u201d Arone said.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed on Friday said the pandemic poses severe risks to businesses of all sizes and millions of households. It said there could be a sharp rise in defaults as households struggle to pay bills.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the Federal Reserve has removed worries about liquidity with its facilities and asset purchases. \u201cThe reality is the solvency issue which is the bigger focus of the economy and they go hand in hand with the employment issues as things that have to be addressed at some point,\u201d he said. \u201cLook out over the next two months, the solvency issues are based on how the economy reopens and how that medical progress looks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the Fed\u2019s corporate bond program has helped companies refinance and clean up their balance sheet so if insolvencies become a big problem it would not be until next year. He said how the economy reopens over the next few months will determine what happens.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe numbers are out in front of us. We do believe based on what we\u2019re seeing so far, this is the trough of every reading we\u2019re seeing. We do believe things are going to get better. We don\u2019t have reason to believe that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the reopenings would be graded as a \u2018B\u2019 of \u2018B+\u2019 based on how they appear to be going so far, including the infection rates. Nearly all states have resumed some level of activity.\n*****\n&gt; But the market will continue to be choppy until there is more medical progress, such as a vaccine. In a sense, the market depends on science more than ever, Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf all of a sudden, we have a commercially viable vaccine in the first half of next year that\u2019s going to be injected into peoples\u2019 arms prior to, or well before the fall of 2021, then I do think you could make the argument the market is potentially going to hit new all time highs,\u201d Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; # Range bound\n&gt; For now though, he sees the market as range bound, and the S&amp;P 500 is currently about in the middle of it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe have been very adamant about the definition of this market as being neither bull nor bear. It\u2019s bounded by the 200-day moving average on the top, which is basically 3,000 and the 200-week moving average on the bottom which is 2,667 right now,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Arone agrees stocks are going to be choppy, and could react to friction. He said one source of friction is the disagreement over state reopenings, between people who want to see a reopening and those that fear a new outbreak. He said there is also friction between Republicans and Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think until we get clarity that the economy is open and without incident and some of these economic numbers are improving, I think the market is going to remain choppy,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said it makes sense for the market to remain in a sideways range while different issues are resolved.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn a valuation basis, the market is expensive but it\u2019s not so expensive if you assume this economic period is going to be over in a couple of quarters,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cIf you return to growth in the third and fourth quarter which we don\u2019t necessarily know if that\u2019s going to be robust, but we expect it to be better next year.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said he expects a recovery to be more shaped like a bathtub, than like a V or a U, meaning it would be elongated on the bottom before an upturn.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPart of what actually supports the market is this abject negativity. When everyone is already pessimistic the presumption is they\u2019ve already done a lot of their selling so there isn\u2019t a ton of fuel for the downside there,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zvpr3QV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AG078t9.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/rZdWJAt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yC4IyAc.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HovLnbP.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hgJTyte.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iPw8MFr.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QBgwc4P.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SUxpLyG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QmygShJ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9XPyDjX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1vFPlrt.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/joZmmeD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retail Sales Telling the Economy\u2019s Story\n\n&gt; Retail sales numbers for April were released today, and the basic story was no surprise. Retail sales fell a record 16.4% in April, after declining 8.4% in March, already the largest decline since the government started keeping records in 1992.\n\n&gt; The year-over-year decline of more than -21.6% has already topped the -11.5% seen during depths of the financial crisis, as shown in the accompanying chart. But there are hints that the decline has been heavily influenced by store closures rather than shoppers tightening their belts, and that might bode well for the future as the economy gradually starts to open up.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.15.20-Retail-Sales-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cOne of the reasons for the major decline in retail sales is simply because many businesses are closed,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cAs the economy slowly opens back up, retail sales should bounce back, as pent-up demand is there\u201d\n\n&gt; For the past two months, the economy experienced an 89% decline in apparel sales and a 59.2% decline in restaurant sales. These numbers capture the effects of businesses closing. The one area of the retail sales numbers that has done relatively well? Groceries had a record April as consumers stocked up and continued to show some strength in May.\n\n&gt; While it will take time for retail sales to get back to normal, several factors are in play that should help support retail activity as the economy opens up. Pent-up demand is increasingly evident. Fiscal stimulus should help preserve incomes. And consumer balance sheets remain relatively healthy, with credit card debt declining the most in decades in March. While weakness will continue, April data may be the low point for retail sales, with good prospects for some strength in the second half of the year. A return to full strength will ultimately depend on the progress doctors and scientists make in limiting the dangers from COVID-19, but even the gradual opening up of the economy may show retail sales numbers starting to stabilize as early as next month.\n\n*****\n\n# How Expensive Are Stocks Right Now?\n\n&gt; As stocks rallied 30% off the March 23 lows and earnings expectations were cut dramatically, valuations have become increasingly concerning for many investors (including some high-profile hedge fund managers being quoted in the financial press).\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the forward (next 12 months) price-to-earnings (PE) multiple for the S&amp;P 500 Index recently eclipsed 20, which is overvalued based on historical averages and at the highest level since the tech bubble in the late 1990s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.14.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While stocks look expensive on this metric\u2014one of the reasons why we expect a correction of perhaps 10% from the April 29 highs\u2014valuations may be getting too much attention.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks look overvalued based on earnings estimates for the next year, which will probably fall further,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile the return to 2019\u2019s earnings levels may still be two years or more off, the potential for steady improvement and low interest rates suggest they may not be as stretched as they appear.\u201d\n\n&gt; So how worried should investors be? Here are three reasons not to worry too much:\n\n&gt; * Earnings will eventually come back. This recession has an end date, and eventually we\u2019ll beat this virus. So while earnings will take time to reach last year\u2019s levels, they should steadily improve starting next quarter. A vaccine could accelerate the timetable.\n&gt; * Interest rates and inflation are low. A 20 PE with a sub-1% yield on the 10-year Treasury without a whiff of inflation on the horizon is not unreasonable. And Federal Reserve support isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. In such a low-rate environment, the opportunity cost of waiting an extra year for earnings to come through is not high. Most of a stock\u2019s value is derived from the earnings the company could generate in year two and beyond.\n&gt; * Valuations are not good short-term timing tools. There is essentially no statistical relationship between PE ratios and subsequent one-year performance for the stock market. Although we expect more volatility as the path of the economy and corporate profits becomes clearer, we also expect stocks to grow into their valuations as earnings likely recover next year.\n\n&gt; Stocks are expensive on traditional PE metrics, and a correction would not surprise us. But given the environment we\u2019re in, valuations are not as worrisome as they may appear. The potential for a steady recovery in earnings over the next couple of years with low interest rates suggests that some of the valuation fears may be exaggerated.\n\n*****\n\n# Why Gold Will Continue To Shine\n\n&gt; Gold has done quite well so far in 2020, up more than 12% year to date versus the S&amp;P 500 Index which is down about 10%. We started to warm to the yellow metal late last year and continue to think it can serve as a potential hedge in a well-diversified portfolio for suitable investors.\n\n&gt; \u201cFrom COVID-19, to massive monetary stimulus, to historically lower yields, to potentially negative fed funds rates down the road, there are many reasons to think gold could continue its recent strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold based for years before breaking out last year. This is a strong chart from a technical perspective and eventual new highs over the coming years could be quite likely.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.13.20-gold-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retest Possible, But Bottom Likely In as Jobless Claims Trend Lower\n\n&gt; Initial Weekly Jobless Claims of 3.3 million, 6.9 million, 6.6 million, 5.2 million, 4.4 million, 3.8 million, 3.2 million and 3.0 million the past eight weeks, totaling 36.5 million, is astonishing. The good news is the trend is lower and as we pointed out in mid-April four weeks ago a spike peak in Initial Claims and an immediate precipitous retreat has been an effective indication of a bear market low over the years.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s chart, presented above, is from the FRED database hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis compares the recent history of Jobless claims with the Wilshire 5000.

Clearly, the March 23 low and the spike high in Claims at the end of that week correlate quite well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4e19557c405d330902008fffb0a44c9/6eb13090bbcbbb54-1c/s500x750/43d5f31c2ba69a27a6253c19a4e3323b55287794.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Sentiment Unexpectedly Improves\n\n&gt; The preliminary read on sentiment from the University of Michigan was a surprising bright spot in Friday's weak economic data as the headline reading improved from 71.8 up to 73.7 versus expectations for a decline to 68.0. Even with this increase, sentiment remains near a 10-year low, so it's not as though investors are actually positive, they're just less negative. While the increase in sentiment was a bit of a surprise, it makes sense. April was a month where the economy was essentially shut down, so the impact of that sudden stop on sentiment was intense. However, now that things have started to thaw a little bit, you can't fault people for becoming more optimistic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH.png))**\n\n&gt; While consumers are feeling a bit better about the way things are, they are still extremely uneasy about the future. The chart below breaks down sentiment towards current conditions and expectations about the future. While the current conditions component showed some improvement, the expectations component saw further declines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH-C-vs-E.png))**\n\n&gt; One question in the monthly survey that caused us to do a double-take was the question that asks, \"During the last few months, have you heard of any favorable or unfavorable changes in business conditions? And what did you hear?\" In this month's survey, the index that tracks instances of unfavorable news mentions hit a record high of 141. This series goes all the way back to 1959, and never before has it been near current levels. The prior high for this index was back in the depths of the financial crisis when the index peaked at 133. There hasn't been much good news lately, but even this reading is extreme.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-News.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Remain On Guard\n\n&gt; In a post earlier today, we noted that individual investors still remain overwhelmingly bearish despite the equity market's rally off the March lows. Another sentiment indicator released by TD Ameritrade supports this view that investors aren't particularly bullish right now. The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors\u2019 portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.\n\n&gt; The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index has been in existence since 2010, and in that entire history there have only been five months where the index was weaker than it is now, and that was from October 2011 through February 2012. That was also a period that marked a major low in the equity market and was followed by a nearly uninterrupted three-year rally in the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; While the Investor Movement Index is near record lows right now, it has been weak for some time, and that weakness came even as the S&amp;P 500 was climbing to record highs over the last 12-18 months. In other words, while investors are just about as cautious as they have been at any time in the last ten years, this conservatism is nothing new.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051420-Investor-Movement-Index.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$NAT** \n&gt; * **$TGT** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$SE** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$BJ** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$TTWO** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$OAS** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$MCK** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$INSE** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$FL** \n&gt; * **$DNR** \n&gt; * **$EXPE** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$CBL** \n&gt; * **$DE** \n&gt; * **$KMDA** \n&gt; * **$SPLK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$EXP** \n&gt; * **$WB** \n&gt; * **$NIU** \n&gt; * **$HZN** \n&gt; * **$TNK** \n&gt; * **$TRVG** \n&gt; * **$IGT** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$OMP** \n&gt; * **$URBN** \n&gt; * **$SNPS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/SUxpLyG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QfbW3wN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/HmyOo14.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.18.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AyHFMTJ.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5ZcrgPO.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.19.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DWLvaBT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ClIq9Ts.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7SQEwiM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vhjzEL1.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.21.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oJLC8tG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UVcv4sk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IsY2N2x.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.22.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Walmart Inc. $125.94\n&gt; **Walmart Inc.

More data in the coming week may reveal how the housing market fared in April, after the economy abruptly fell off a cliff when states shut down their economies in the second half of March.\n*****\n&gt; Investors\u2019 focus will also be on the government stimulus programs to help the economy and markets get through the coronavirus crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appear before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, as it reviews the government\u2019s trillions in spending to help the economy, businesses and individuals. An interview with Powell will also air on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday night.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season is winding down but there are a number of reports from major retailers, like Walmart and Target, which should show that the big box stores and discounters are making out better than other retailers as consumers halted many discretionary purchases and moved more shopping online.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down nearly 2.3%, in its worst week since March 20. The S&amp;P ended at 2,863. The Dow was off about 2.6% for the week, in its worst week since April 3. It finished the week at 23,598. The Nasdaq also had its worst week since April 3.\n*****\n&gt; # Home sweet home\n&gt; \u201cHousing is going to be important in that you\u2019ll see the chilling effect that Covid has had on housing as well, less on construction than on sales, but on both,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chef economist at Grant Thornton. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be an issue. One of the key things we\u2019re watching going forward is the credit market and housing. There\u2019s been a real tightening of credit because of the servicers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said the mortgage servicers are caught in the middle between the banks and people who aren\u2019t making their payments. She said it has been impacting lending. \u201cThat\u2019s something we cannot afford. Housing was on a tear before, and it has to pull us out of this,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales were down 16.4% in April, and there was an unevenness of performance across the sector. The only positive category was online shopping, up 8.4%. Clothing and accessories, the types of things department stores sell, fell by 78.8% in April. Building materials and garden equipment were down just 3.5%, and that could help Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s which report earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarket reactions to the data have been somewhat muted,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. He said stocks on Friday were reacting negatively to threats from China that U.S. companies could be targeted if the U.S. does not ease up on Huawei. \u201cThe markets right now don\u2019t need another reason to be pessimistic. It seems like both the bond market and stock market are getting a little tired. Both markets are looking for the next catalyst.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Solvency concerns\n&gt; The Fed has been given generally high marks for keeping markets liquid, but analysts say they are now more worried about the solvency of companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting kind of threshold here as we\u2019re approaching three months stay at homes or shelter in place. We\u2019re moving from a liquidity challenge, which the Fed helped us address, to a solvency challenge,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief market strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said unpaid bills start to pile up and default rates rise on credit cards and mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe longer this goes on, the harder for folks to make those payments. That\u2019s why states are eager to open even if it has some risks,\u201d Arone said.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed on Friday said the pandemic poses severe risks to businesses of all sizes and millions of households. It said there could be a sharp rise in defaults as households struggle to pay bills.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the Federal Reserve has removed worries about liquidity with its facilities and asset purchases. \u201cThe reality is the solvency issue which is the bigger focus of the economy and they go hand in hand with the employment issues as things that have to be addressed at some point,\u201d he said. \u201cLook out over the next two months, the solvency issues are based on how the economy reopens and how that medical progress looks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the Fed\u2019s corporate bond program has helped companies refinance and clean up their balance sheet so if insolvencies become a big problem it would not be until next year. He said how the economy reopens over the next few months will determine what happens.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe numbers are out in front of us. We do believe based on what we\u2019re seeing so far, this is the trough of every reading we\u2019re seeing. We do believe things are going to get better. We don\u2019t have reason to believe that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the reopenings would be graded as a \u2018B\u2019 of \u2018B+\u2019 based on how they appear to be going so far, including the infection rates. Nearly all states have resumed some level of activity.\n*****\n&gt; But the market will continue to be choppy until there is more medical progress, such as a vaccine. In a sense, the market depends on science more than ever, Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf all of a sudden, we have a commercially viable vaccine in the first half of next year that\u2019s going to be injected into peoples\u2019 arms prior to, or well before the fall of 2021, then I do think you could make the argument the market is potentially going to hit new all time highs,\u201d Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; # Range bound\n&gt; For now though, he sees the market as range bound, and the S&amp;P 500 is currently about in the middle of it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe have been very adamant about the definition of this market as being neither bull nor bear. It\u2019s bounded by the 200-day moving average on the top, which is basically 3,000 and the 200-week moving average on the bottom which is 2,667 right now,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Arone agrees stocks are going to be choppy, and could react to friction. He said one source of friction is the disagreement over state reopenings, between people who want to see a reopening and those that fear a new outbreak. He said there is also friction between Republicans and Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think until we get clarity that the economy is open and without incident and some of these economic numbers are improving, I think the market is going to remain choppy,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said it makes sense for the market to remain in a sideways range while different issues are resolved.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn a valuation basis, the market is expensive but it\u2019s not so expensive if you assume this economic period is going to be over in a couple of quarters,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cIf you return to growth in the third and fourth quarter which we don\u2019t necessarily know if that\u2019s going to be robust, but we expect it to be better next year.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said he expects a recovery to be more shaped like a bathtub, than like a V or a U, meaning it would be elongated on the bottom before an upturn.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPart of what actually supports the market is this abject negativity. When everyone is already pessimistic the presumption is they\u2019ve already done a lot of their selling so there isn\u2019t a ton of fuel for the downside there,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zvpr3QV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AG078t9.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/rZdWJAt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yC4IyAc.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HovLnbP.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hgJTyte.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iPw8MFr.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QBgwc4P.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SUxpLyG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QmygShJ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9XPyDjX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1vFPlrt.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/joZmmeD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retail Sales Telling the Economy\u2019s Story\n\n&gt; Retail sales numbers for April were released today, and the basic story was no surprise. Retail sales fell a record 16.4% in April, after declining 8.4% in March, already the largest decline since the government started keeping records in 1992.\n\n&gt; The year-over-year decline of more than -21.6% has already topped the -11.5% seen during depths of the financial crisis, as shown in the accompanying chart. But there are hints that the decline has been heavily influenced by store closures rather than shoppers tightening their belts, and that might bode well for the future as the economy gradually starts to open up.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.15.20-Retail-Sales-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cOne of the reasons for the major decline in retail sales is simply because many businesses are closed,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cAs the economy slowly opens back up, retail sales should bounce back, as pent-up demand is there\u201d\n\n&gt; For the past two months, the economy experienced an 89% decline in apparel sales and a 59.2% decline in restaurant sales. These numbers capture the effects of businesses closing. The one area of the retail sales numbers that has done relatively well? Groceries had a record April as consumers stocked up and continued to show some strength in May.\n\n&gt; While it will take time for retail sales to get back to normal, several factors are in play that should help support retail activity as the economy opens up. Pent-up demand is increasingly evident. Fiscal stimulus should help preserve incomes. And consumer balance sheets remain relatively healthy, with credit card debt declining the most in decades in March. While weakness will continue, April data may be the low point for retail sales, with good prospects for some strength in the second half of the year. A return to full strength will ultimately depend on the progress doctors and scientists make in limiting the dangers from COVID-19, but even the gradual opening up of the economy may show retail sales numbers starting to stabilize as early as next month.\n\n*****\n\n# How Expensive Are Stocks Right Now?\n\n&gt; As stocks rallied 30% off the March 23 lows and earnings expectations were cut dramatically, valuations have become increasingly concerning for many investors (including some high-profile hedge fund managers being quoted in the financial press).\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the forward (next 12 months) price-to-earnings (PE) multiple for the S&amp;P 500 Index recently eclipsed 20, which is overvalued based on historical averages and at the highest level since the tech bubble in the late 1990s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.14.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While stocks look expensive on this metric\u2014one of the reasons why we expect a correction of perhaps 10% from the April 29 highs\u2014valuations may be getting too much attention.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks look overvalued based on earnings estimates for the next year, which will probably fall further,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile the return to 2019\u2019s earnings levels may still be two years or more off, the potential for steady improvement and low interest rates suggest they may not be as stretched as they appear.\u201d\n\n&gt; So how worried should investors be? Here are three reasons not to worry too much:\n\n&gt; * Earnings will eventually come back. This recession has an end date, and eventually we\u2019ll beat this virus. So while earnings will take time to reach last year\u2019s levels, they should steadily improve starting next quarter. A vaccine could accelerate the timetable.\n&gt; * Interest rates and inflation are low. A 20 PE with a sub-1% yield on the 10-year Treasury without a whiff of inflation on the horizon is not unreasonable. And Federal Reserve support isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. In such a low-rate environment, the opportunity cost of waiting an extra year for earnings to come through is not high. Most of a stock\u2019s value is derived from the earnings the company could generate in year two and beyond.\n&gt; * Valuations are not good short-term timing tools. There is essentially no statistical relationship between PE ratios and subsequent one-year performance for the stock market. Although we expect more volatility as the path of the economy and corporate profits becomes clearer, we also expect stocks to grow into their valuations as earnings likely recover next year.\n\n&gt; Stocks are expensive on traditional PE metrics, and a correction would not surprise us. But given the environment we\u2019re in, valuations are not as worrisome as they may appear. The potential for a steady recovery in earnings over the next couple of years with low interest rates suggests that some of the valuation fears may be exaggerated.\n\n*****\n\n# Why Gold Will Continue To Shine\n\n&gt; Gold has done quite well so far in 2020, up more than 12% year to date versus the S&amp;P 500 Index which is down about 10%. We started to warm to the yellow metal late last year and continue to think it can serve as a potential hedge in a well-diversified portfolio for suitable investors.\n\n&gt; \u201cFrom COVID-19, to massive monetary stimulus, to historically lower yields, to potentially negative fed funds rates down the road, there are many reasons to think gold could continue its recent strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold based for years before breaking out last year. This is a strong chart from a technical perspective and eventual new highs over the coming years could be quite likely.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.13.20-gold-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retest Possible, But Bottom Likely In as Jobless Claims Trend Lower\n\n&gt; Initial Weekly Jobless Claims of 3.3 million, 6.9 million, 6.6 million, 5.2 million, 4.4 million, 3.8 million, 3.2 million and 3.0 million the past eight weeks, totaling 36.5 million, is astonishing. The good news is the trend is lower and as we pointed out in mid-April four weeks ago a spike peak in Initial Claims and an immediate precipitous retreat has been an effective indication of a bear market low over the years.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s chart, presented above, is from the FRED database hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis compares the recent history of Jobless claims with the Wilshire 5000. (Gaps in the Wilshire index line are market holidays.) Clearly, the March 23 low and the spike high in Claims at the end of that week correlate quite well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4e19557c405d330902008fffb0a44c9/6eb13090bbcbbb54-1c/s500x750/43d5f31c2ba69a27a6253c19a4e3323b55287794.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Sentiment Unexpectedly Improves\n\n&gt; The preliminary read on sentiment from the University of Michigan was a surprising bright spot in Friday's weak economic data as the headline reading improved from 71.8 up to 73.7 versus expectations for a decline to 68.0. Even with this increase, sentiment remains near a 10-year low, so it's not as though investors are actually positive, they're just less negative. While the increase in sentiment was a bit of a surprise, it makes sense. April was a month where the economy was essentially shut down, so the impact of that sudden stop on sentiment was intense. However, now that things have started to thaw a little bit, you can't fault people for becoming more optimistic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH.png))**\n\n&gt; While consumers are feeling a bit better about the way things are, they are still extremely uneasy about the future. The chart below breaks down sentiment towards current conditions and expectations about the future. While the current conditions component showed some improvement, the expectations component saw further declines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH-C-vs-E.png))**\n\n&gt; One question in the monthly survey that caused us to do a double-take was the question that asks, \"During the last few months, have you heard of any favorable or unfavorable changes in business conditions? And what did you hear?\" In this month's survey, the index that tracks instances of unfavorable news mentions hit a record high of 141. This series goes all the way back to 1959, and never before has it been near current levels. The prior high for this index was back in the depths of the financial crisis when the index peaked at 133. There hasn't been much good news lately, but even this reading is extreme.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-News.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Remain On Guard\n\n&gt; In a post earlier today, we noted that individual investors still remain overwhelmingly bearish despite the equity market's rally off the March lows. Another sentiment indicator released by TD Ameritrade supports this view that investors aren't particularly bullish right now. The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors\u2019 portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.\n\n&gt; The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index has been in existence since 2010, and in that entire history there have only been five months where the index was weaker than it is now, and that was from October 2011 through February 2012. That was also a period that marked a major low in the equity market and was followed by a nearly uninterrupted three-year rally in the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; While the Investor Movement Index is near record lows right now, it has been weak for some time, and that weakness came even as the S&amp;P 500 was climbing to record highs over the last 12-18 months. In other words, while investors are just about as cautious as they have been at any time in the last ten years, this conservatism is nothing new.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051420-Investor-Movement-Index.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$NAT** \n&gt; * **$TGT** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$SE** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$BJ** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$TTWO** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$OAS** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$MCK** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$INSE** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$FL** \n&gt; * **$DNR** \n&gt; * **$EXPE** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$CBL** \n&gt; * **$DE** \n&gt; * **$KMDA** \n&gt; * **$SPLK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$EXP** \n&gt; * **$WB** \n&gt; * **$NIU** \n&gt; * **$HZN** \n&gt; * **$TNK** \n&gt; * **$TRVG** \n&gt; * **$IGT** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$OMP** \n&gt; * **$URBN** \n&gt; * **$SNPS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/SUxpLyG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QfbW3wN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/HmyOo14.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.18.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AyHFMTJ.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5ZcrgPO.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.19.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DWLvaBT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ClIq9Ts.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7SQEwiM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vhjzEL1.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.21.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oJLC8tG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UVcv4sk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IsY2N2x.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.22.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Walmart Inc. $125.94\n&gt; **Walmart Inc.

And now with most of the earnings season in the books, look for the latest coronavirus headlines to fill the vacuum and weigh on stocks the rest of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Fourth-quarter profit growth for S&amp;P 500 companies came in at 3.1%, and if the energy sector is excluded, the growth rate was 6.0%, according to Refinitiv. Just about four weeks ago, analysts expected a slight decline.\n*****\n&gt; However, the deluge of solid corporate results was largely overlooked by investors who are focusing on the spillover impact from the coronavirus on U.S. corporations. Stocks post losses this week as a jump in confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths deepened concerns about slowing global economic growth. Major U.S. companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble have sounded alarms on the disease, warning of a dent in profits down the road.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe virus is totally underrated,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said on Friday.\u201cWhat I think is a little too premature is they all presume that it is going to be solved within a foreseeable time frame. At what point do we say that many, many companies are going to be hurt by the virus [and] we\u2019re paying too much for stocks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018More cautious than usual\u2019\n&gt; Wall Street analysts have been quick to slash their earnings expectations for the next quarter in light of the fast-spreading virus. Expectations for earnings growth in the first quarter have been cut in half to just 3.2% from more than 6% at the start of 2020, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Companies themselves are also lowering guidance for earnings growth in the near future. There have been more U.S. companies issuing below-consensus guidance for the next quarter than those with upbeat forecasts, marking the weakest ratio in a February since 2014, according to Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile guidance is typically weak in the first quarter as corporates set a low bar, it has been more cautious than usual this earnings season, likely due to the coronavirus,\u201d Subramanian said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have cited coronavirus during their earnings call this season, according to FactSet. These companies\u2019 average revenue exposure to China is 7.2%, compared to 4.8% exposure for the average S&amp;P 500 company.\n*****\n&gt; As of Friday, China\u2019s National Health Commission reported more than 75,000 confirmed cases and over 2,000 deaths on the mainland. South Korea has also reported more than 200 cases. Meanwhile, World health officials said the outbreak in Iran is \u201cvery worrisome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season,\u201d John Lynch, LPL Financial\u2019s chief investment strategist, said in a note. \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ePo2a9q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ClwuPuJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/jpEvLyH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/flHhHRv.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HyjYjBt.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/XCThMbQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TN0RBSk.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ixAr7Su.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ncauH0T.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/x4XfkyA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yeknvyf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hOU10RV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Earnings Season Observations\n\n&gt; The recent news that technology giant Apple would miss its fourth quarter 2020 revenue targets has understandably increased investor anxiety surrounding the potential economic impact of the coronavirus (now called COVID-19). Lost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season.\n\n&gt; \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cDespite slowing global economic growth, weakness in capital investment and manufacturing, a strong US dollar, and a huge drop in energy sector profits, S&amp;P 500 companies are impressively grinding out 1-2 percentage points of overall earnings growth.\u201d The fourth quarter earnings growth may cement the third quarter of 2019 as the trough, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some highlights of this earnings season:\n\n&gt; * **Solid revenue upside**. A solid 65% of S&amp;P 500 Index companies have beaten revenue estimates, the highest level since second quarter 2018 and well above the long-term average at 57%. S&amp;P 500 companies have produced a larger-than-normal nearly one percentage point positive revenue surprise and are tracking to a 3.5% top-line increase.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/revenue-tracking-nicely-ahead-of-expectations-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Respectable earnings upside despite headwinds**. The earnings beat rate at 71% is slightly above the 10-year average (70%). S&amp;P 500 earnings growth has surprised by a solid 4.4% so far despite economic, currency, and commodity headwinds.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Consider the energy drag**. Though 1-2% overall earnings growth isn\u2019t much, the gain is approximately 4%, excluding the energy sector.\n&gt; * **Sector standout**. One of the most China-exposed sectors produced one of the biggest upside earnings surprises: Technology. Technology sector earnings growth is tracking to a 5% year-over-year increase, about 9 percentage points above prior estimates.\n&gt; * **Reassuring outlooks**. Estimates for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share in 2020 have only fallen by about 0.9% since December 31, 2019. Though these numbers may come down a bit more in the coming days and the China situation remains fluid, this modest reduction reflects U.S. companies\u2019 resilience overall amid significant supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n# Election Year March: Performance Haunted By Steep 1980 Declines\n\n&gt; Boisterous March markets tend to drive prices up early in the month and batter stocks at month end. Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to \u201cbeware the Ides of March\u201d but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. In March 2001, DJIA plunged 1469 points (-11.8%) from March 9 to the 22.\n\n&gt; Normally a decent performing market month, March is somewhat above average in election years with advances 64.7% of the time with a 1.0% average DJIA gain since 1952. S&amp;P 500 has also advanced 64.7% of the time since 1952, but gains have been slightly better at 1.2%, on average. NASDAQ has not fared well in March in election years since 1972. Due to a 17.1% loss in 1980, March is NASDAQ\u2019s second worst month of the election year. Similarly, March 1980\u2019s steep losses adversely affect Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indices.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9950c2a54b4059c3ffe0481a83cf281a/573a7bf3eae7af17-3d/s400x600/7703526bf6d4a2214d4e4b75883edec7f23d56af.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Performance Throughout The Presidencies\n\n&gt; As markets were closed to observe Presidents Day yesterday and the 2020 Presidential election continues to ramp up, we thought it would be a good time to check up on stock performance during different administrations. In the table below, we show the performance of the Dow during the administrations of every US president since 1900 in addition to the annualized return. In the time since President Trump was sworn into office, the Dow has risen 46.9%. On an annualized basis, the 13.3% return places the current administration in 3rd place for the strongest performance. Only the Clinton administration in the 1990s and Coolidge administration in the 1920s have observed stronger annualized gains. The one caveat of course is that President Trump's term (or terms) has yet to end. Comparing Democratic and Republican administrations since 1900, Democratic presidencies have tended to average stronger returns than their Republican peers, so the stock market's returns under President Trump have deviated somewhat from the norm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-Presidents1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it is impossible to say what a candidate's election will mean for the market, at the moment betting markets favor the incumbent to win the presidency while Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg go back and forth in taking the number 2 spot, hovering around 15%-16%. Come Super Tuesday (March 3rd) when we could finally see more clarity on the Democratic side, the back and forth between Bloomberg and Sanders might become more one-sided.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-EBO.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yet Another Corona Friday\n\n&gt; The major indices decided it was five o'clock somewhere right off the bat today as they experience yet another \"Corona Friday\". More concerns around the coronavirus have sent stocks lower with the S&amp;P 500 down around 1.1% as of this writing and the Nasdaq down nearly 2% today. Declines on a Friday have become par for the course in 2020. Fridays have been the weakest day of the week so far in 2020; the only one to average a decline. On average, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.52% on Fridays while the next worst day has been Monday which has averaged a gain of 0.19%. Fridays have also been the day that the S&amp;P 500 has closed higher the least. Only 28.6% of Fridays this year have seen the S&amp;P 500 finish in the green. That compares to a positive close more than three-quarters of the time on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. While it has averaged a gain of 0.24%, Tuesdays have also experienced a positive close less than half of the time.

All three indexes are well above their respective historical averages for this time of an election year. NASDAQ has in fact already exceeded its average full election year performance going back to 1972. Bullish sentiment and momentum appear to be firmly in place and historical election year patterns suggests strength could easily continue for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 into May. NASDAQ\u2019s surge higher could be vulnerable to a retreat sooner, in March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/baea2768b612eb15dbd047fbc0cff07b/5100d48ef25e7c53-d2/s500x750/10e181f3beef5c191c7ec0ad2bf7e50a0e449324.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Dow Without Boeing (BA)\n\n&gt; For more than a year now, Boeing (BA) has been plagued by the 737 MAX crisis which has weighed on shares of the plane manufacturer with it now currently down nearly 20% from when the initial groundings took place on March 10th of last year. Despite this, while underperforming the broader market due to the 737 issues, the stock is actually still up just over 5% since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; Even though BA has lagged, it is still the highest-priced of the 30 stocks in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average. Currently trading around $338.50, the only stocks in the index holding a candle to BA are Apple (AAPL) and UnitedHealth (UNH), which also trade north of $300 per share. That means these stocks have the highest weighting in the index and therefore have a much larger impact than other stocks on the Dow's performance.\n\n&gt; With BA's issues, a number of people have pondered the what-ifs for the Dow had the company not had the issues with the 737. Would we have already broken out the Dow 30K hats were it not for BA? In the chart below, we show the actual performance of the DJIA and have overlaid the performance of an 'alternate Dow' showing its performance if BA had not been in the index since the start of 2019. We used the start of 2019 instead of the actual date of the groundings as it is a little less arbitrary. By our calculations, while we would be a bit closer, even if BA wasn't in the index since the start of 2019, we wouldn't quite be at Dow 30K yet. As shown, our alternate Dow would be almost 1% or 266 points higher if Boeing was not included in the index since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; While BA has been a drag on the DJIA since last March, it also provided a big boost to the index in early 2018 before the 737 issues hit the stock. In fact, at the start of March 2017, BA was up over 36% YTD and the spread between the Dow's performance with and without BA was around 700 points in the other direction as it is now!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow-wo-BA-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Another example of this dynamic in which high priced stocks have a greater impact on the index was observed on Tuesday when Apple's (AAPL) stock fell after the company warned that Q1 revenues would be shy of prior guidance due to the coronavirus. The warnings sent shares down over 3% at its intraday lows, but the stock only finished down 1.83%. While there were equivalent or larger declines like Dow (DOW) or Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) in Tuesday's session, AAPL's declines by far weighed on the index more than any other stock. Of the Dow's 165.89 point decline, AAPL contributed 40.35 points. Fortunately, UNH helped to mitigate some of those losses as it had a positive impact on the index of +22.79 points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow2.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BYND**\n&gt; * **$SQ** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$SPCE** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$CRON** \n&gt; * **$CHK** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$TTD** \n&gt; * **$AMRN** \n&gt; * **$SHAK** \n&gt; * **$KOS** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$ILPT** \n&gt; * **$CLVS** \n&gt; * **$TNDM** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$CRI** \n&gt; * **$SPNS** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$CTB** \n&gt; * **$ETSY** \n&gt; * **$TREE** \n&gt; * **$KEYS** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$GWPH** \n&gt; * **$W** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$WEN** \n&gt; * **$CROX** \n&gt; * **$DIN** \n&gt; * **$DNR** \n&gt; * **$LL** \n&gt; * **$DORM** \n&gt; * **$GH** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$MGI** \n&gt; * **$AMT** \n&gt; * **$JCP** \n&gt; * **$CBRL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/qvtfNhx.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/kpCRctt.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3PTK97f.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eNbMCOD.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/qV7qy6J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eNgrHgV.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FopcLUz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2yyK6HI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dsgBu6B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9VYkHyk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/5mFOqR0.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rd8JhvX.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WrX9hNT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jsCwSCH.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/fzm6EPP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lKtvBHM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Beyond Meat, Inc. $117.45\n&gt; **Beyond Meat, Inc.

And now with most of the earnings season in the books, look for the latest coronavirus headlines to fill the vacuum and weigh on stocks the rest of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Fourth-quarter profit growth for S&amp;P 500 companies came in at 3.1%, and if the energy sector is excluded, the growth rate was 6.0%, according to Refinitiv. Just about four weeks ago, analysts expected a slight decline.\n*****\n&gt; However, the deluge of solid corporate results was largely overlooked by investors who are focusing on the spillover impact from the coronavirus on U.S. corporations. Stocks post losses this week as a jump in confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths deepened concerns about slowing global economic growth. Major U.S. companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble have sounded alarms on the disease, warning of a dent in profits down the road.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe virus is totally underrated,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said on Friday.\u201cWhat I think is a little too premature is they all presume that it is going to be solved within a foreseeable time frame. At what point do we say that many, many companies are going to be hurt by the virus [and] we\u2019re paying too much for stocks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018More cautious than usual\u2019\n&gt; Wall Street analysts have been quick to slash their earnings expectations for the next quarter in light of the fast-spreading virus. Expectations for earnings growth in the first quarter have been cut in half to just 3.2% from more than 6% at the start of 2020, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Companies themselves are also lowering guidance for earnings growth in the near future. There have been more U.S. companies issuing below-consensus guidance for the next quarter than those with upbeat forecasts, marking the weakest ratio in a February since 2014, according to Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile guidance is typically weak in the first quarter as corporates set a low bar, it has been more cautious than usual this earnings season, likely due to the coronavirus,\u201d Subramanian said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have cited coronavirus during their earnings call this season, according to FactSet.

Lost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season.\n\n&gt; \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cDespite slowing global economic growth, weakness in capital investment and manufacturing, a strong US dollar, and a huge drop in energy sector profits, S&amp;P 500 companies are impressively grinding out 1-2 percentage points of overall earnings growth.\u201d The fourth quarter earnings growth may cement the third quarter of 2019 as the trough, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some highlights of this earnings season:\n\n&gt; * **Solid revenue upside**. A solid 65% of S&amp;P 500 Index companies have beaten revenue estimates, the highest level since second quarter 2018 and well above the long-term average at 57%. S&amp;P 500 companies have produced a larger-than-normal nearly one percentage point positive revenue surprise and are tracking to a 3.5% top-line increase.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/revenue-tracking-nicely-ahead-of-expectations-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Respectable earnings upside despite headwinds**. The earnings beat rate at 71% is slightly above the 10-year average (70%). S&amp;P 500 earnings growth has surprised by a solid 4.4% so far despite economic, currency, and commodity headwinds.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Consider the energy drag**. Though 1-2% overall earnings growth isn\u2019t much, the gain is approximately 4%, excluding the energy sector.\n&gt; * **Sector standout**. One of the most China-exposed sectors produced one of the biggest upside earnings surprises: Technology. Technology sector earnings growth is tracking to a 5% year-over-year increase, about 9 percentage points above prior estimates.\n&gt; * **Reassuring outlooks**. Estimates for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share in 2020 have only fallen by about 0.9% since December 31, 2019. Though these numbers may come down a bit more in the coming days and the China situation remains fluid, this modest reduction reflects U.S. companies\u2019 resilience overall amid significant supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n# Election Year March: Performance Haunted By Steep 1980 Declines\n\n&gt; Boisterous March markets tend to drive prices up early in the month and batter stocks at month end. Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to \u201cbeware the Ides of March\u201d but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. In March 2001, DJIA plunged 1469 points (-11.8%) from March 9 to the 22.\n\n&gt; Normally a decent performing market month, March is somewhat above average in election years with advances 64.7% of the time with a 1.0% average DJIA gain since 1952. S&amp;P 500 has also advanced 64.7% of the time since 1952, but gains have been slightly better at 1.2%, on average. NASDAQ has not fared well in March in election years since 1972. Due to a 17.1% loss in 1980, March is NASDAQ\u2019s second worst month of the election year. Similarly, March 1980\u2019s steep losses adversely affect Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indices.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9950c2a54b4059c3ffe0481a83cf281a/573a7bf3eae7af17-3d/s400x600/7703526bf6d4a2214d4e4b75883edec7f23d56af.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Performance Throughout The Presidencies\n\n&gt; As markets were closed to observe Presidents Day yesterday and the 2020 Presidential election continues to ramp up, we thought it would be a good time to check up on stock performance during different administrations. In the table below, we show the performance of the Dow during the administrations of every US president since 1900 in addition to the annualized return. In the time since President Trump was sworn into office, the Dow has risen 46.9%. On an annualized basis, the 13.3% return places the current administration in 3rd place for the strongest performance. Only the Clinton administration in the 1990s and Coolidge administration in the 1920s have observed stronger annualized gains. The one caveat of course is that President Trump's term (or terms) has yet to end. Comparing Democratic and Republican administrations since 1900, Democratic presidencies have tended to average stronger returns than their Republican peers, so the stock market's returns under President Trump have deviated somewhat from the norm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-Presidents1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it is impossible to say what a candidate's election will mean for the market, at the moment betting markets favor the incumbent to win the presidency while Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg go back and forth in taking the number 2 spot, hovering around 15%-16%. Come Super Tuesday (March 3rd) when we could finally see more clarity on the Democratic side, the back and forth between Bloomberg and Sanders might become more one-sided.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-EBO.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yet Another Corona Friday\n\n&gt; The major indices decided it was five o'clock somewhere right off the bat today as they experience yet another \"Corona Friday\". More concerns around the coronavirus have sent stocks lower with the S&amp;P 500 down around 1.1% as of this writing and the Nasdaq down nearly 2% today. Declines on a Friday have become par for the course in 2020. Fridays have been the weakest day of the week so far in 2020; the only one to average a decline. On average, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.52% on Fridays while the next worst day has been Monday which has averaged a gain of 0.19%. Fridays have also been the day that the S&amp;P 500 has closed higher the least. Only 28.6% of Fridays this year have seen the S&amp;P 500 finish in the green. That compares to a positive close more than three-quarters of the time on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. While it has averaged a gain of 0.24%, Tuesdays have also experienced a positive close less than half of the time.

All three indexes are well above their respective historical averages for this time of an election year. NASDAQ has in fact already exceeded its average full election year performance going back to 1972. Bullish sentiment and momentum appear to be firmly in place and historical election year patterns suggests strength could easily continue for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 into May. NASDAQ\u2019s surge higher could be vulnerable to a retreat sooner, in March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/baea2768b612eb15dbd047fbc0cff07b/5100d48ef25e7c53-d2/s500x750/10e181f3beef5c191c7ec0ad2bf7e50a0e449324.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Dow Without Boeing (BA)\n\n&gt; For more than a year now, Boeing (BA) has been plagued by the 737 MAX crisis which has weighed on shares of the plane manufacturer with it now currently down nearly 20% from when the initial groundings took place on March 10th of last year. Despite this, while underperforming the broader market due to the 737 issues, the stock is actually still up just over 5% since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; Even though BA has lagged, it is still the highest-priced of the 30 stocks in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average. Currently trading around $338.50, the only stocks in the index holding a candle to BA are Apple (AAPL) and UnitedHealth (UNH), which also trade north of $300 per share. That means these stocks have the highest weighting in the index and therefore have a much larger impact than other stocks on the Dow's performance.\n\n&gt; With BA's issues, a number of people have pondered the what-ifs for the Dow had the company not had the issues with the 737. Would we have already broken out the Dow 30K hats were it not for BA? In the chart below, we show the actual performance of the DJIA and have overlaid the performance of an 'alternate Dow' showing its performance if BA had not been in the index since the start of 2019. We used the start of 2019 instead of the actual date of the groundings as it is a little less arbitrary. By our calculations, while we would be a bit closer, even if BA wasn't in the index since the start of 2019, we wouldn't quite be at Dow 30K yet. As shown, our alternate Dow would be almost 1% or 266 points higher if Boeing was not included in the index since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; While BA has been a drag on the DJIA since last March, it also provided a big boost to the index in early 2018 before the 737 issues hit the stock. In fact, at the start of March 2017, BA was up over 36% YTD and the spread between the Dow's performance with and without BA was around 700 points in the other direction as it is now!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow-wo-BA-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Another example of this dynamic in which high priced stocks have a greater impact on the index was observed on Tuesday when Apple's (AAPL) stock fell after the company warned that Q1 revenues would be shy of prior guidance due to the coronavirus. The warnings sent shares down over 3% at its intraday lows, but the stock only finished down 1.83%. While there were equivalent or larger declines like Dow (DOW) or Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) in Tuesday's session, AAPL's declines by far weighed on the index more than any other stock. Of the Dow's 165.89 point decline, AAPL contributed 40.35 points. Fortunately, UNH helped to mitigate some of those losses as it had a positive impact on the index of +22.79 points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow2.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BYND**\n&gt; * **$SQ** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$SPCE** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$CRON** \n&gt; * **$CHK** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$TTD** \n&gt; * **$AMRN** \n&gt; * **$SHAK** \n&gt; * **$KOS** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$ILPT** \n&gt; * **$CLVS** \n&gt; * **$TNDM** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$CRI** \n&gt; * **$SPNS** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$CTB** \n&gt; * **$ETSY** \n&gt; * **$TREE** \n&gt; * **$KEYS** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$GWPH** \n&gt; * **$W** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$WEN** \n&gt; * **$CROX** \n&gt; * **$DIN** \n&gt; * **$DNR** \n&gt; * **$LL** \n&gt; * **$DORM** \n&gt; * **$GH** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$MGI** \n&gt; * **$AMT** \n&gt; * **$JCP** \n&gt; * **$CBRL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/qvtfNhx.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/kpCRctt.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3PTK97f.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eNbMCOD.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/qV7qy6J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eNgrHgV.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FopcLUz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2yyK6HI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dsgBu6B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9VYkHyk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/5mFOqR0.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rd8JhvX.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WrX9hNT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jsCwSCH.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/fzm6EPP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lKtvBHM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Beyond Meat, Inc. $117.45\n&gt; **Beyond Meat, Inc.
