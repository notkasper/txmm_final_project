I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 13th, 2020.\n\n# **Banks and health care companies will report earnings, but virus updates will matter most in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/banks-and-health-care-companies-will-report-earnings-but-virus-updates-will-matter-most-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Major banks and health care companies will be the first to reveal how the early weeks of the coronavirus shutdowns impacted their profits, outlook, work force and customers.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season begins in the week ahead, with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Johnson &amp; Johnson among the first to release first quarter earnings reports Tuesday. But the stock market that appears to be willing to overlook anticipated bad news for now.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMost of the slowdown occurred in March,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cDo we react to the hypernegative economic data we see? What we do react to is any semblance of guidance. There is no clarity about duration of the economic slowdown. You\u2019re going to see a preponderance of companies pulling their guidance for the calendar year ... I think it\u2019s going to be more companies doing that, than not.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks bounced higher in the four-day pre-Easter holiday week, with the S&amp;P 500 up 12.1%, in the best week since 1974. Investors reacted to signs that new cases of the virus may be peaking in U.S. hot spots and Europe. The stock market also got a boost Thursday from the Fed\u2019s announcement of a $2.3 trillion in programs to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The market will turn its focus to earnings in the coming week, but there are also some important economic reports, including March retail sales. The virus shutdowns resulted in a rapid closing of many retail establishments, a sudden drop off in gasoline sales, and a steep decline in auto sales. That has resulted in a forecast for a 7% decline in March retail sales.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople are more interested in news about the spread of the virus than they are about the economic data,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cWe got another massive increase in jobless claims. That\u2019s ignored because we\u2019re listening to who is plateauing ... Is New York actually getting better and we see a peak? I get the feeling people are going to look at the first quarter earnings and say, \u2018we know this and you should pull your guidance.\u2019\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Before March, analysts had expected an increase of several percent in first quarter earnings. According to Refinitiv\u2019s I/B/E/S, the forecasts and some actual numbers point to an 8.1% decline. For the second quarter, earnings are expected to decline about 20%, while economists expect an unprecedented 30% contraction in GDP during the quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Weekly claims data will also be important, now with nearly 17 million claims filed in just three weeks. Economists expect millions more to be filed for the week ending April 11.\n*****\n&gt; Other major banks report in the week ahead, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday. Hogan said companies like JPMorgan may be able to reveal how the Fed\u2019s programs are working, both those for small business lending and others that were intended to help the credit markets.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for financial companies are expected to be down 13.7%, according to I/B/E/S data. Communications services companies are expected to have fared the best in the first quarter, with an expected 7.8% earnings gain. Health care companies are expected to see a modest gain of 1.6%.\n*****\n&gt; The market will also watch Johnson &amp; Johnson and Abbott on Thursday, as they discuss not only their results but potential developments with coronavirus-related therapies or products. J&amp;J is working on a potential coronavirus vaccine, while Abbott has a new test kit for the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u2019That\u2019s going to be the more intriguing aspect of the conference call when Abbott talks about their new test kit and how fast it is, and what they can produce,\u201d said Hogan.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts are also watching to see whether companies discuss ways they are cutting back costs. \u201cAs we go through the earnings season, what we\u2019re concerned about is what companies are going to cut their dividends,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n&gt; UBS Global Wealth Management strategists said in a note that 51 companies, accounting for 27% of 2019 aggregate buybacks, have suspended their repurchase programs. More capital was returned to shareholders via buybacks than dividends.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs a result, dividend payout ratios are somewhat low compared to other regions. So despite the expected sharp decline in profits for 2020, we expect more modest dividend cuts of 6-8%,\u201d the UBS strategists wrote. \u201cFor now, we are assuming that the Federal Reserve does not require US banks to cut or suspend their dividends. We expect further dividend cuts in the consumer discretionary, energy, and real estate sectors. Healthcare, segments of tech, and consumer staples will likely report token dividend increases.\u201d\n*****\nKrosby said as the earnings season goes on, investors will be watching ways the economy could begin to return to normal.\n*****\n\u201cThe market is moving in phases right now. The most important phase is the virus itself,\u201d she said. She said it will matter a lot that New York continues to show positives, like a plateauing of cases and fewer hospitalizations.\n*****\nEventually companies will be able to talk about moving forward . \u201cAre they seeing anything in terms of green shoots? Any positives? These are going to be very important as we go through the earnings season,\u201d Krosby said. \u201cThat is complimented by when do we lift the restrictions on going back to work, and the polling data will be critical on when Americans feel comfortable going back to work, going back to a more normal environment.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jydpa4r.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/2KVnUpD.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tKEZCDV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Vl29a31.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gG1GYBJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CFxYfuM.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sDx3ZUb.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JVrX2zh.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1eH6DxY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/t9gvaNQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TTjfAqY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Annual Declines Are Rare\n\n&gt; Stocks have rallied nicely off the March 23 lows on the back of a bold policy response from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and lawmakers in Washington, DC, which was followed by signs that a peak in growth of COVID-19 cases may come soon. At Wednesday\u2019s close, the S&amp;P 500 Index stood 19% above the March 23 closing low but down 17.7% for the year. That begs the question whether a positive year is possible with a pretty big hole still left to dig out of.\n\n&gt; \u201cA positive year for the S&amp;P 500 is still possible but will require a steady recovery in economic growth and corporate profits in the second half of the year,\u201d noted Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist. \u201cWe remain hopeful that COVID-19 can be contained over the next month or two and enable the US economy to begin to open up early this summer, but it\u2019s just too early to tell.\u201d\n\n&gt; As we see in the LPL Chart of the Day, big down years are rare. In fact, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 15% just four times (1973-74, 2002, 2008).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-negative-years-are-rare.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\n&gt; So might 2020 look like 2009, a big up year for stocks as the worst of the financial crisis passed and markets looked ahead to recovery? That year the S&amp;P 500 was down 25% year to date before rallying to end the year higher. Or is this another 1973-74, or even 2000-2002, with stocks in the doldrums for an extended period?\n\n&gt; Given the possibility that the bear market catalyst might be removed over the next couple of months, we expect the bear market recovery to be relatively swift by historical standards\u2014potentially faster than the 20-month average and hopefully closer to the non-recession bear market recovery average of 10 months. The key to a possible rebound, beyond timely containment of COVID-19, will be investor confidence in recovery. The bold policy response, part of our Road to Recovery playbook, is helping bridge many businesses to the other side of the crisis.\n\n&gt; We think chances are good that 2020 ends up being closer to the middle of the accompanying chart rather than the far left. During these uncertain times, it\u2019s important for investors to keep in mind that markets are forward looking. The latest bounce off of the late-March lows provided evidence that market participants are doing just that. We don\u2019t know if a durable stock market low is in just yet, and volatility may pick up again as more bad economic news and corporate stress is revealed. Our resolve is being tested, we but we remain optimistic about prospects for a strong recovery in the second half of the year.\n\n*****\n\n# Good Friday Trading: Strength Before Weakness After\n\n&gt; Tradition can provide some solace in these historic and trying times. So as the Hirsch household grates fresh horseradish root among other family traditions to prepare for our first tele-Seder on Zoom for the first night of Passover tonight I like to wish everyone a sweet Passover and a happy, healthy and safe Easter.\n\n&gt; In keeping with our traditional seasonality posts, here is the update on the trading patterns around the Good Friday NYSE Holiday. I took the picture above of the mosaic on the interior of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Old City of Jerusalem in August 2018 on our family trip for my oldest son\u2019s bar mitzvah. It seemed apropos for today.\n\n&gt; Good Friday is the one NYSE holiday with a clear positive bias before and negativity the day after. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have solid average gains on the day before but are all net losers on the day after Easter since 1980. NASDAQ has been notably strong, up 18 of the last 19 days before Good Friday with the one loss occurring in 2017.\n\n&gt; The day after Easter has the worst post-holiday record though average losses are steeper after Presidents\u2019 Day. The S&amp;P 500 was down 16 of 20 years from 1984-2003 on the day after Easter but is has been up eleven of the last sixteen years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9dfa69c2fcbd854841afd385aa6e9945/432622d729e14bc4-95/s500x750/30391e92507c49caa1f7d1e194bde8fb75af580f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Up, Dollar Down\n\n&gt; For a majority of the past year the US dollar has been fairly range bound, but the massive move away from risk assets more recently led to major buying for what is globally considered a safe haven currency. From its 52 week low and high on March 9th and March 20th, respectively, the dollar index rose 8.28%. But since that peak just before the equity market's bottom, the dollar index has come back down; currently ~3.25% below that high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Dollar.png))**\n\n&gt; With the dollar lower, another safe haven that tends to trade inversely has benefited: gold. Since late February, the yellow metal had struggled to break out to new highs, but this week it has finally broken out. Currently, gold is at its highest level since late 2012.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# All or Nothing Days on the Rise\n\n&gt; We consider an 'all or nothing day' to be a day where the net daily breadth reading (daily advancing stocks minus declining stocks) for the S&amp;P 500 is above +400 or below -400. While these types of days were practically non-existent in the 1990s, beginning in the early 2000s, their frequency started to rise with the increased popularity of trading in the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY). Whereas investors used to buy and sell individual stocks, the increased popularity of SPY moved the market more towards the type of environment where investors were buying and selling the market.\n\n&gt; All or nothing days also increase in frequency during periods of increased market volatility, and that trend has been no different this time around either. The chart below shows the 50-day moving average of all or nothing days going back to 1990. Over the last 50 trading days, more than a third of all trading days have been all or nothing days. The only two other times where the average was higher in the last thirty years were in December 2008 and November 2011. The average got close to current levels back in late 2015 and early 2016 but was never able to quite get above 33%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-50-DMA.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at the frequency of all or nothing days on an annual basis shows another interesting trend. So far this year, there have been 19 all or nothing days for the S&amp;P 500. We may be barely a quarter into 2020 so far, but this year's total already ranks above more than half of the 31 years since 1990. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace to have 70 all or nothing days in 2020, which would tie 2011 for the most ever in a given year. It's only April, but 2020 is shaping up to be the year of record volatility.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-By-Year.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Volatility Remains High\n\n&gt; Given the big rally off the lows of late March, we've had a number of questions related to the VIX and why it remains high. As of Tuesday afternoon, the VIX was in the mid-40s which is very high relative to readings over the last decade but actually down significantly from its recent highs above 80.\n\n&gt; The reason the VIX is still in the 40s is because the market remains volatile. While volatility is typically associated with markets that are moving lower, it can actually go both ways, which is exactly what we're seeing now. The charts below do a good job of illustrating just how extraordinary the market's swings have been in recent weeks. In many cases, it's unlike anything anyone reading this has ever seen before.\n\n&gt; Over the last five weeks, the S&amp;P 500's average absolute daily percentage change has been +/-4.8%. That's higher than we saw at the height of the financial crisis, after the 1987 crash, and in the late stages of the Great Depression. The only time the S&amp;P's average daily move over a five-week period was greater was after the Crash of 1929.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Avg-Daily-Change-25.png))**\n\n&gt; Tuesday's rally also puts the S&amp;P 500 on pace for its 13th straight day of moving up or down 1% or more. That's a longer streak than anything seen during the Financial Crisis and just two shy of the 15 straight days we saw in October 2002 at the lows of that bear market. Before that, though, the only other period where there was a longer streak of 1% daily moves was during the Great Depression.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Streaks-of-1.png))**\n\n&gt; While 13 straight daily 1% moves is extreme by any measure, what makes this current streak even more notable is that it would be the second 13-day streak of 1% moves in the last 27 trading days. That's right, from 3/2 through 3/18, the S&amp;P 500 went 13 straight days of moving up or down 1%. Then, on 3/19, the S&amp;P 500 broke that streak by rallying just 0.47%. Since then, though, it's been 1% all the time again with the S&amp;P 500 on pace for its 13 straight daily move of 1% again. Looking at this another way, in the last five weeks (25 trading days) the S&amp;P 500 has seen a 1% move 24 times. The only other time that has occurred was during the Great Depression when there were two separate occurrences.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-25-Day-Rolling-Total.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Semis Holding Up Relative to Market\n\n&gt; In a post yesterday, we noted that the relative strength of semiconductors versus energy had finally eclipsed its record high from the dot-com boom in March 2000. Semis have not only exhibited relative strength versus the energy sector; they've demonstrated strength versus the broader market as well. Take the relative strength of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) versus the S&amp;P 500. In the early stages of the market decline from the February highs, semiconductors saw a sharp drop in their relative strength, but in late March, the SOX surged relative to the broader market and actually hit a record high on March 24th. With Technology playing an increased role in the stay-at-home and work-from-home economy, it makes sense that semis would hold up relatively well.\n\n&gt; From that high on 3/24, we saw a modest pullback in the strength of the semis relative to the S&amp;P 500, which then bounced again in recent days. Going forward, the key for the semis is over which level it breaks first. Will it be the March high or the short-term low three days later on 3/27 that followed.

The chart below illustrates this trend as the Vermont Senator's odds to win have dropped dramatically since Super Tuesday.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Sand.png))**\n\n&gt; As we have noted in the past, the odds of winning for the more progressive candidates on the Democratic ticket have typically had an inverse relationship to the Health Care sector's performance because their policies are more likely to shake up the business model of companies in this sector. Despite that relationship, Health Care stocks saw little in the way of a boost from Sanders dropping out of the race. There wasn't a single point in the trading day today where Health Care was the top-performing sector in the S&amp;P 500, although its performance relative to the S&amp;P 500 did pick up slightly in the afternoon after the Sanders announcement.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/ETF.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$JPM** \n&gt; * **$JNJ** \n&gt; * **$RAD** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$WFC** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$C** \n&gt; * **$APHA** \n&gt; * **$FAST** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$GS** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$TSM** \n&gt; * **$BLK** \n&gt; * **$PNC** \n&gt; * **$CBSH** \n&gt; * **$FRC** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$USB** \n&gt; * **$AMRN** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$LAKE** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$BK** \n&gt; * **$JBHT** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$SON** \n&gt; * **$WIT** \n&gt; * **$KSU** \n&gt; * **$BLX** \n&gt; * **$STT** \n&gt; * **$GHG** \n&gt; * **$HOMB** \n&gt; * **$MUSA** \n&gt; * **$RF** \n&gt; * **$BMI** \n&gt; * **$WAFD** \n&gt; * **$CFG** \n&gt; * **$SRC** \n&gt; * **$MRTN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/JVrX2zh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/B2kmHtZ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n5DF27L.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pn8vLlA.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1VMyerF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LC8fC6P.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hnVrPsq.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTAVuP4.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dNQTcXr.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.17.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. $102.76\n&gt; **JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

I think it\u2019s going to be more companies doing that, than not.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks bounced higher in the four-day pre-Easter holiday week, with the S&amp;P 500 up 12.1%, in the best week since 1974. Investors reacted to signs that new cases of the virus may be peaking in U.S. hot spots and Europe. The stock market also got a boost Thursday from the Fed\u2019s announcement of a $2.3 trillion in programs to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The market will turn its focus to earnings in the coming week, but there are also some important economic reports, including March retail sales. The virus shutdowns resulted in a rapid closing of many retail establishments, a sudden drop off in gasoline sales, and a steep decline in auto sales. That has resulted in a forecast for a 7% decline in March retail sales.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople are more interested in news about the spread of the virus than they are about the economic data,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cWe got another massive increase in jobless claims. That\u2019s ignored because we\u2019re listening to who is plateauing ... Is New York actually getting better and we see a peak? I get the feeling people are going to look at the first quarter earnings and say, \u2018we know this and you should pull your guidance.\u2019\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Before March, analysts had expected an increase of several percent in first quarter earnings. According to Refinitiv\u2019s I/B/E/S, the forecasts and some actual numbers point to an 8.1% decline. For the second quarter, earnings are expected to decline about 20%, while economists expect an unprecedented 30% contraction in GDP during the quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Weekly claims data will also be important, now with nearly 17 million claims filed in just three weeks. Economists expect millions more to be filed for the week ending April 11.\n*****\n&gt; Other major banks report in the week ahead, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday. Hogan said companies like JPMorgan may be able to reveal how the Fed\u2019s programs are working, both those for small business lending and others that were intended to help the credit markets.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for financial companies are expected to be down 13.7%, according to I/B/E/S data. Communications services companies are expected to have fared the best in the first quarter, with an expected 7.8% earnings gain. Health care companies are expected to see a modest gain of 1.6%.\n*****\n&gt; The market will also watch Johnson &amp; Johnson and Abbott on Thursday, as they discuss not only their results but potential developments with coronavirus-related therapies or products. J&amp;J is working on a potential coronavirus vaccine, while Abbott has a new test kit for the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u2019That\u2019s going to be the more intriguing aspect of the conference call when Abbott talks about their new test kit and how fast it is, and what they can produce,\u201d said Hogan.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts are also watching to see whether companies discuss ways they are cutting back costs. \u201cAs we go through the earnings season, what we\u2019re concerned about is what companies are going to cut their dividends,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n&gt; UBS Global Wealth Management strategists said in a note that 51 companies, accounting for 27% of 2019 aggregate buybacks, have suspended their repurchase programs. More capital was returned to shareholders via buybacks than dividends.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs a result, dividend payout ratios are somewhat low compared to other regions. So despite the expected sharp decline in profits for 2020, we expect more modest dividend cuts of 6-8%,\u201d the UBS strategists wrote. \u201cFor now, we are assuming that the Federal Reserve does not require US banks to cut or suspend their dividends. We expect further dividend cuts in the consumer discretionary, energy, and real estate sectors. Healthcare, segments of tech, and consumer staples will likely report token dividend increases.\u201d\n*****\nKrosby said as the earnings season goes on, investors will be watching ways the economy could begin to return to normal.\n*****\n\u201cThe market is moving in phases right now. The most important phase is the virus itself,\u201d she said. She said it will matter a lot that New York continues to show positives, like a plateauing of cases and fewer hospitalizations.\n*****\nEventually companies will be able to talk about moving forward . \u201cAre they seeing anything in terms of green shoots? Any positives? These are going to be very important as we go through the earnings season,\u201d Krosby said. \u201cThat is complimented by when do we lift the restrictions on going back to work, and the polling data will be critical on when Americans feel comfortable going back to work, going back to a more normal environment.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jydpa4r.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/2KVnUpD.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tKEZCDV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Vl29a31.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gG1GYBJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CFxYfuM.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sDx3ZUb.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JVrX2zh.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1eH6DxY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/t9gvaNQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TTjfAqY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Annual Declines Are Rare\n\n&gt; Stocks have rallied nicely off the March 23 lows on the back of a bold policy response from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and lawmakers in Washington, DC, which was followed by signs that a peak in growth of COVID-19 cases may come soon. At Wednesday\u2019s close, the S&amp;P 500 Index stood 19% above the March 23 closing low but down 17.7% for the year. That begs the question whether a positive year is possible with a pretty big hole still left to dig out of.\n\n&gt; \u201cA positive year for the S&amp;P 500 is still possible but will require a steady recovery in economic growth and corporate profits in the second half of the year,\u201d noted Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist. \u201cWe remain hopeful that COVID-19 can be contained over the next month or two and enable the US economy to begin to open up early this summer, but it\u2019s just too early to tell.\u201d\n\n&gt; As we see in the LPL Chart of the Day, big down years are rare. In fact, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 15% just four times (1973-74, 2002, 2008).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-negative-years-are-rare.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\n&gt; So might 2020 look like 2009, a big up year for stocks as the worst of the financial crisis passed and markets looked ahead to recovery? That year the S&amp;P 500 was down 25% year to date before rallying to end the year higher. Or is this another 1973-74, or even 2000-2002, with stocks in the doldrums for an extended period?\n\n&gt; Given the possibility that the bear market catalyst might be removed over the next couple of months, we expect the bear market recovery to be relatively swift by historical standards\u2014potentially faster than the 20-month average and hopefully closer to the non-recession bear market recovery average of 10 months. The key to a possible rebound, beyond timely containment of COVID-19, will be investor confidence in recovery. The bold policy response, part of our Road to Recovery playbook, is helping bridge many businesses to the other side of the crisis.\n\n&gt; We think chances are good that 2020 ends up being closer to the middle of the accompanying chart rather than the far left. During these uncertain times, it\u2019s important for investors to keep in mind that markets are forward looking. The latest bounce off of the late-March lows provided evidence that market participants are doing just that. We don\u2019t know if a durable stock market low is in just yet, and volatility may pick up again as more bad economic news and corporate stress is revealed. Our resolve is being tested, we but we remain optimistic about prospects for a strong recovery in the second half of the year.\n\n*****\n\n# Good Friday Trading: Strength Before Weakness After\n\n&gt; Tradition can provide some solace in these historic and trying times. So as the Hirsch household grates fresh horseradish root among other family traditions to prepare for our first tele-Seder on Zoom for the first night of Passover tonight I like to wish everyone a sweet Passover and a happy, healthy and safe Easter.\n\n&gt; In keeping with our traditional seasonality posts, here is the update on the trading patterns around the Good Friday NYSE Holiday. I took the picture above of the mosaic on the interior of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Old City of Jerusalem in August 2018 on our family trip for my oldest son\u2019s bar mitzvah. It seemed apropos for today.\n\n&gt; Good Friday is the one NYSE holiday with a clear positive bias before and negativity the day after. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have solid average gains on the day before but are all net losers on the day after Easter since 1980. NASDAQ has been notably strong, up 18 of the last 19 days before Good Friday with the one loss occurring in 2017.\n\n&gt; The day after Easter has the worst post-holiday record though average losses are steeper after Presidents\u2019 Day. The S&amp;P 500 was down 16 of 20 years from 1984-2003 on the day after Easter but is has been up eleven of the last sixteen years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9dfa69c2fcbd854841afd385aa6e9945/432622d729e14bc4-95/s500x750/30391e92507c49caa1f7d1e194bde8fb75af580f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Up, Dollar Down\n\n&gt; For a majority of the past year the US dollar has been fairly range bound, but the massive move away from risk assets more recently led to major buying for what is globally considered a safe haven currency. From its 52 week low and high on March 9th and March 20th, respectively, the dollar index rose 8.28%. But since that peak just before the equity market's bottom, the dollar index has come back down; currently ~3.25% below that high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Dollar.png))**\n\n&gt; With the dollar lower, another safe haven that tends to trade inversely has benefited: gold. Since late February, the yellow metal had struggled to break out to new highs, but this week it has finally broken out. Currently, gold is at its highest level since late 2012.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# All or Nothing Days on the Rise\n\n&gt; We consider an 'all or nothing day' to be a day where the net daily breadth reading (daily advancing stocks minus declining stocks) for the S&amp;P 500 is above +400 or below -400. While these types of days were practically non-existent in the 1990s, beginning in the early 2000s, their frequency started to rise with the increased popularity of trading in the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY). Whereas investors used to buy and sell individual stocks, the increased popularity of SPY moved the market more towards the type of environment where investors were buying and selling the market.\n\n&gt; All or nothing days also increase in frequency during periods of increased market volatility, and that trend has been no different this time around either. The chart below shows the 50-day moving average of all or nothing days going back to 1990. Over the last 50 trading days, more than a third of all trading days have been all or nothing days. The only two other times where the average was higher in the last thirty years were in December 2008 and November 2011. The average got close to current levels back in late 2015 and early 2016 but was never able to quite get above 33%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-50-DMA.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at the frequency of all or nothing days on an annual basis shows another interesting trend. So far this year, there have been 19 all or nothing days for the S&amp;P 500. We may be barely a quarter into 2020 so far, but this year's total already ranks above more than half of the 31 years since 1990. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace to have 70 all or nothing days in 2020, which would tie 2011 for the most ever in a given year. It's only April, but 2020 is shaping up to be the year of record volatility.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-By-Year.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Volatility Remains High\n\n&gt; Given the big rally off the lows of late March, we've had a number of questions related to the VIX and why it remains high. As of Tuesday afternoon, the VIX was in the mid-40s which is very high relative to readings over the last decade but actually down significantly from its recent highs above 80.\n\n&gt; The reason the VIX is still in the 40s is because the market remains volatile. While volatility is typically associated with markets that are moving lower, it can actually go both ways, which is exactly what we're seeing now. The charts below do a good job of illustrating just how extraordinary the market's swings have been in recent weeks. In many cases, it's unlike anything anyone reading this has ever seen before.\n\n&gt; Over the last five weeks, the S&amp;P 500's average absolute daily percentage change has been +/-4.8%. That's higher than we saw at the height of the financial crisis, after the 1987 crash, and in the late stages of the Great Depression. The only time the S&amp;P's average daily move over a five-week period was greater was after the Crash of 1929.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Avg-Daily-Change-25.png))**\n\n&gt; Tuesday's rally also puts the S&amp;P 500 on pace for its 13th straight day of moving up or down 1% or more. That's a longer streak than anything seen during the Financial Crisis and just two shy of the 15 straight days we saw in October 2002 at the lows of that bear market. Before that, though, the only other period where there was a longer streak of 1% daily moves was during the Great Depression.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Streaks-of-1.png))**\n\n&gt; While 13 straight daily 1% moves is extreme by any measure, what makes this current streak even more notable is that it would be the second 13-day streak of 1% moves in the last 27 trading days. That's right, from 3/2 through 3/18, the S&amp;P 500 went 13 straight days of moving up or down 1%. Then, on 3/19, the S&amp;P 500 broke that streak by rallying just 0.47%. Since then, though, it's been 1% all the time again with the S&amp;P 500 on pace for its 13 straight daily move of 1% again. Looking at this another way, in the last five weeks (25 trading days) the S&amp;P 500 has seen a 1% move 24 times. The only other time that has occurred was during the Great Depression when there were two separate occurrences.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-25-Day-Rolling-Total.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Semis Holding Up Relative to Market\n\n&gt; In a post yesterday, we noted that the relative strength of semiconductors versus energy had finally eclipsed its record high from the dot-com boom in March 2000. Semis have not only exhibited relative strength versus the energy sector; they've demonstrated strength versus the broader market as well. Take the relative strength of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) versus the S&amp;P 500. In the early stages of the market decline from the February highs, semiconductors saw a sharp drop in their relative strength, but in late March, the SOX surged relative to the broader market and actually hit a record high on March 24th. With Technology playing an increased role in the stay-at-home and work-from-home economy, it makes sense that semis would hold up relatively well.\n\n&gt; From that high on 3/24, we saw a modest pullback in the strength of the semis relative to the S&amp;P 500, which then bounced again in recent days. Going forward, the key for the semis is over which level it breaks first. Will it be the March high or the short-term low three days later on 3/27 that followed. Whichever way it breaks will likely dictate which way the broader market goes as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Semis-vs-SP500-With-Dates.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Health Care Gets No Booster Shot From Sanders\n\n&gt; Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Presidential race today, and while his chances of ever securing the nomination were slim to none, his dropping out does reduce a small amount of uncertainty. The chart below illustrates this trend as the Vermont Senator's odds to win have dropped dramatically since Super Tuesday.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Sand.png))**\n\n&gt; As we have noted in the past, the odds of winning for the more progressive candidates on the Democratic ticket have typically had an inverse relationship to the Health Care sector's performance because their policies are more likely to shake up the business model of companies in this sector. Despite that relationship, Health Care stocks saw little in the way of a boost from Sanders dropping out of the race. There wasn't a single point in the trading day today where Health Care was the top-performing sector in the S&amp;P 500, although its performance relative to the S&amp;P 500 did pick up slightly in the afternoon after the Sanders announcement.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/ETF.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$JPM** \n&gt; * **$JNJ** \n&gt; * **$RAD** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$WFC** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$C** \n&gt; * **$APHA** \n&gt; * **$FAST** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$GS** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$TSM** \n&gt; * **$BLK** \n&gt; * **$PNC** \n&gt; * **$CBSH** \n&gt; * **$FRC** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$USB** \n&gt; * **$AMRN** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$LAKE** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$BK** \n&gt; * **$JBHT** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$SON** \n&gt; * **$WIT** \n&gt; * **$KSU** \n&gt; * **$BLX** \n&gt; * **$STT** \n&gt; * **$GHG** \n&gt; * **$HOMB** \n&gt; * **$MUSA** \n&gt; * **$RF** \n&gt; * **$BMI** \n&gt; * **$WAFD** \n&gt; * **$CFG** \n&gt; * **$SRC** \n&gt; * **$MRTN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/JVrX2zh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/B2kmHtZ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n5DF27L.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pn8vLlA.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1VMyerF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LC8fC6P.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hnVrPsq.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTAVuP4.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dNQTcXr.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.17.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. $102.76\n&gt; **JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

I think they will consequently bleed over into Q2. However, due to their unpredictable nature, I have been left surprised many times. Like for example how they reached 1000. that was unexpected for sure. On the flip side, I truly think they are 10 years ahead of their time especially in the automotive industry. Musk is truly a very talented individual but is off the walls sometimes (making flamethrowers and calling people pedo). I don't know where I stand in terms of TSLA. I am leaning a little bit for them. I know an infamous group (AARK) promotes TSLA and speculates to be in the 3000 range in a few years. Fangay alert. Please let me know what your thoughts are. \n\nI want to make a disclaimer that this is my fun portfolio and only 10% of my total holdings. The remainder 90% are all in 401k, ROTH IRAs containing total market funds. And in contrast to the Reddit public opinion, around 50 percent of my portfolio is in cash.

I know they did really well for the first quarter which gave everyone hard ons but I'm certain they closed down a factory right towards the end of the Q1 reporting. I think they will consequently bleed over into Q2. However, due to their unpredictable nature, I have been left surprised many times. Like for example how they reached 1000. that was unexpected for sure. On the flip side, I truly think they are 10 years ahead of their time especially in the automotive industry. Musk is truly a very talented individual but is off the walls sometimes (making flamethrowers and calling people pedo). I don't know where I stand in terms of TSLA. I am leaning a little bit for them. I know an infamous group (AARK) promotes TSLA and speculates to be in the 3000 range in a few years. Fangay alert. Please let me know what your thoughts are. \n\nI want to make a disclaimer that this is my fun portfolio and only 10% of my total holdings. The remainder 90% are all in 401k, ROTH IRAs containing total market funds. And in contrast to the Reddit public opinion, around 50 percent of my portfolio is in cash. I pulled out after the first big red drop. \n\nI plan to start putting in weekly. I think I'll really start jumping in after Q1 reports come out for most of these companies.

Just a few dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report in the four-day trading week, including IBM Tuesday and Intel on Thursday. Johnson &amp; Johnson reports Wednesday; Procter &amp; Gamble is Thursday, and American Express releases results Friday. The stock market is closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump travels to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum, where he speaks Tuesday. With the China trade deal signed this past Wednesday, strategists say they are now watching for any signs of a bigger trade row brewing between the U.S. and Europe.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports, including existing home sales Wednesday; leading indicators Thursday, and the Markit PMI data for manufacturing and services on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; But it\u2019s earnings, where investors will take the pulse of corporate America, and decide whether forward guidance is justifying the stock market\u2019s record highs and price earnings ratio of more than 18.5. The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 2% in the past week, its best week since August. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,329 Friday and is now up about 3% since the start of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow and Nasdaq also ended the week at new highs. The Dow ended up 1.9% for the week, at 29,348. The Nasdaq rose 2.3% in the past week, ending at 9,388.\n*****\n&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse, said the fourth quarter could be a turning point for earnings, after a poor performance in 2019. So far, earnings are down about 0.8% this quarter, based on actual releases and estimates, according to Refinitiv. If not for the drag from energy companies, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies would have been 1.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201c2019 was a year of lousy earnings, and the fourth quarter is the end of a lousy year,\u201d said Golub. \u201cI think earnings surprises will be fine, but what the real story here is, it looks like magically the 2020 numbers are going to be much, much stronger than 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said there are two big themes this earnings season. \u201cThe first one is tech-related companies. Many of the mega caps had okay earnings, but their margins were under a lot of pressure and it subtracted earnings growth in 2019. Those trends are supposed to reverse. So what was a negative because of easy comps becomes a positive,\u201d Golub said. \u201cThe same thing with the energy sector which was a disaster in terms of earnings growth in 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market rally can continue in part because investors are not yet on board with the earnings story.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile everybody is looking at the fourth quarter, I think they\u2019re not really reading the right script, and the script they should be reading was this was the last quarter where tech margins and energy sector headwinds are overwhelming the market,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The hearings on Trump\u2019s impeachment are so far ignored by markets and will be underway in the Senate. While the market continues to shrug it off, traders are monitoring the situation for any change in tone.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWill there be new evidence/witnesses at the Senate trial to make it politically significant?,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Alan Ruskin. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that for many voters, the President seems to be the main motivator for voters on both sides of the political spectrum \u2014 for and against. This argument runs along the lines that Trump is running against himself/\u2018the anti-Trump\u2019, and, the election will be heavily impacted by which Democrat candidate least impacts the \u2018anti-Trump\u2019 vote \u2014 a view that some argue tends to support centrists like Biden.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7YCrtpo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9jQCYRG.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXureFC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/3upRv6z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O07l30Z.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BjiCdpH.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/w5fgr9y.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/L81ewyy.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vroSSfA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MMO35Qf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/dCxJl8u.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading Mixed since 1998, But Improving Lately\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 22 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.79% by DJIA to 0.14% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last eight years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef3ff1e52532ea69e189a7cd90e7b27/bf3ce263396269e9-14/s500x750/4fc5ea153df07c1e2ab94f583409f214f2eae3c6.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Closer Look At Election Years\n\n&gt; 2020 is off to a roaring start, picking up right where 2019 left off. Many investors are eyeing the upcoming presidential election as an impending storm for the stock market. In the four-year presidential cycle, pre-election years have tended to be the strongest for stocks, as sitting presidents have taken measures to boost the economy and stock market higher to garner votes. It sure worked out well last year, with the S&amp;P 500 Index\u2019s 31% total return.\n\n&gt; Returns in election years, however, have been quite bifurcated.\n\n&gt; \u201cIf an incumbent president was up for reelection, stocks tended to do extremely well,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOn the other hand, if there was a lame duck president in office, returns were quite muted.\u201d\n\n&gt; Note that a \u201clame duck president\u201d means the sitting president either isn\u2019t running for reelection or has already fulfilled the maximum two terms. It makes sense, as the president could be less motivated to do things to heat up the economy if they know they are leaving office. Possibly, investors may also get cold feet knowing a change is coming. The S&amp;P 500 was down in 2000 and 2008, and the sitting president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d both years.\n\n&gt; In the LPL Chart of the Day, we break down election years by whether the president was running for reelection or a lame duck. The chart shows the S&amp;P 500 up an impressive 11.7% on average if the President was running for reelection, compared to up an average of 2.4% if president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d.\n\n&gt; Given most presidents who have run a second time have tended to win, this could be the market\u2019s way of saying it is comfortable with the status quo over change.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another encouraging historical trend is that the S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t been lower during an election year with an incumbent president up for reelection since 1940. To be clear, stocks have been up during election years when the incumbent president actually lost. In 1980, the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 26%, but Jimmy Carter still lost to Ronald Reagan. In other words, this does support the notion of higher stocks in 2020, but higher stocks can\u2019t always tell you who will win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Q4 Earnings Season is All About 2020\n\n&gt; Fourth quarter earnings season kicked off this week with 24 S&amp;P 500 Index companies slated to report results. Our expectations are for a marginal increase in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis, based on current FactSet consensus estimates (-2% year over year) and the average historical upside of roughly 3 percentage points.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve become accustomed to meager earnings growth. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if fourth quarter results are anywhere near expectations, 2019 will end up as a year with S&amp;P 500 returns of more than 30% and no corporate earnings growth to speak of. That means expanding stock valuations drove the market\u2019s gains last year, a trend we do not expect to continue.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Earnings-blog-011520-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWe expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWith valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Accordingly, the key to this reporting season will be whether the optimistic growth outlook reflected in consensus earnings estimates for this year remains intact after companies issue guidance. Many companies will be commenting on 2020 for the first time. Our estimate of $175 per share in S&amp;P 500 EPS for the entire year represents a 6\u20137% increase from our $165 forecast for 2019. Based on the latest consensus estimates, that growth rate may get pushed up a bit. We still think $175 is attainable if capital investment picks up after stalling last year and wage growth remains stable.\n\n&gt; Trade progress may help. The United States and China will sign the phase-one trade deal later today. While negotiations on the next phase will be tougher and could even stall out, businesses would welcome the additional clarity that de-escalation can provide, something that clearly weighed on corporate profits last year.\n\n*****\n\n# January Off To Stronger Than Usual Start \u2013 But 2nd Half Is Weaker\n\n&gt; Stocks are off to a stronger that usual so far in January 2020 when compared in the chart above to the average performance over the most recent 21-year period. As of today\u2019s close DJIA is up 1.41%, S&amp;P 500 +1.61%, NASDAQ leads the pack +3.11% and the Russell 2000 was in the red until the past two days and is now up 0.44%. This is well above historical average performance in recent Januarys.\n\n&gt; The market was up nicely today until reports hit the newswires at about 1:30 pm ET creating uncertainty that the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed tomorrow between the US and China may be pabulum. The realization that the tariffs on Chinese goods may remain in place until after the election as the review process runs its course drove stocks lower this afternoon. The market gave back most of its early gains with only the Dow and Russell 2000 eking out gains today.\n\n&gt; However, as you can see in the dotted lines so far in 2020 the indices are tracking the last 21-years rather closely. If the pattern continues to pan out this year, look for a little strength over the next two days. Then weakness has been prone to appear just after mid-month after the eleventh trading day with mild average losses from on or around the eleventh trading day to the fourteenth trading day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2f102c5c61bd803b4bc407e8c4812e3/1b34c8a8e7ad3e39-e9/s500x750/829ff7ea82b52109b737d17e4b24cb0a4d28e434.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Jackpot for Stocks\n\n&gt; Solid across the board gains this year have put another January Trifecta Jackpot in our sights for 2020. So far our January Trifecta is two for two. Our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system came in positive up 0.7% on January 8 following up on a positive reading for our Santa Claus Rally (SCR) on January 3. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month\u2019s end.\n\n&gt; We just published an update on The Incredible January Barometer: Only 11 Major Errors in 82 Years that runs through the reasons behind the efficacy of the January. We discuss how the passage of the Twentieth \u201cLame Duck\u201d Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 created the January Barometer. We also compare the January Barometer results along with the full year results, the following eleven months results, and the subsequent twelve months results to all other \u201cMonthly Barometers\u201d using the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite\n\n&gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table below). In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing \u201cLast 11 Mon\u201d years, in the table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 \u201319.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.\n\n&gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain decent. Of the last 10 times since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.\n\n&gt; A positive SCR and FFD are encouraging and further clarity will be gained when the January Barometer (page 16, 2020 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac) reports at month\u2019s end. A positive January Barometer would certainly boost prospects for full-year 2020. The December Low Indicator (2020 STA, page 34) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow\u2019s December Closing Low of 27502.81 on 12/3/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1bcaf64028a60761e27f90b96cd50a5/be57098a98452149-c8/s500x750/8bde32d516bf2811adabb784ab6de926796ad504.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equities Closing In On A Breakout\n\n&gt; Below is a chart of the Bloomberg World Equity Market index, which is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 publicly listed companies around the world (including the US). While the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 15% from its January 2018 high, it's notable that we still haven't seen equities break out on a global scale. As shown, the Bloomberg World Index is now just a hair below its prior all-time highs (22 basis points to be exact).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-BBG-World.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-SP-5-years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Three Months And Counting Since Last 1% Decline\n\n&gt; It has now been over three months since the S&amp;P 500's last decline of 1% or more back on 10/9. While it seems like an eternity, the current streak of 67 trading days is nowhere near any sort of record on either a long or short-term basis. The chart below shows historical streaks without a decline of 1%+ for the S&amp;P 500 dating back to 1928. The record for the longest streak was back in 1963 when the S&amp;P 500 went 174 trading days - a full eight months - without a 1% drop. Even more impressive is the fact that in both the 1950s and 1960s there were numerous streaks of 100 or more days. For a decade that is looked back on as one with a lot of upheaval in the US, the 1960s was a period of relative calm for the equity market.\n\n&gt; More recently, the current streak of 67 trading days doesn't look all that impressive relative to streaks we saw back in 2017 and 2018. Right after the election in 2016 and into March of 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had a 109-day streak without a 1% decline, and then from late 2017 through January 2018, there was another streak of 112 trading days without a 1% drop. Even in October 2018, there was another streak of 74 trading days. In other words, in just the last three years there have been three longer streaks without a 1% decline than the current one.

The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,329 Friday and is now up about 3% since the start of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow and Nasdaq also ended the week at new highs. The Dow ended up 1.9% for the week, at 29,348. The Nasdaq rose 2.3% in the past week, ending at 9,388.\n*****\n&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse, said the fourth quarter could be a turning point for earnings, after a poor performance in 2019. So far, earnings are down about 0.8% this quarter, based on actual releases and estimates, according to Refinitiv. If not for the drag from energy companies, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies would have been 1.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201c2019 was a year of lousy earnings, and the fourth quarter is the end of a lousy year,\u201d said Golub. \u201cI think earnings surprises will be fine, but what the real story here is, it looks like magically the 2020 numbers are going to be much, much stronger than 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said there are two big themes this earnings season. \u201cThe first one is tech-related companies. Many of the mega caps had okay earnings, but their margins were under a lot of pressure and it subtracted earnings growth in 2019. Those trends are supposed to reverse. So what was a negative because of easy comps becomes a positive,\u201d Golub said. \u201cThe same thing with the energy sector which was a disaster in terms of earnings growth in 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market rally can continue in part because investors are not yet on board with the earnings story.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile everybody is looking at the fourth quarter, I think they\u2019re not really reading the right script, and the script they should be reading was this was the last quarter where tech margins and energy sector headwinds are overwhelming the market,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The hearings on Trump\u2019s impeachment are so far ignored by markets and will be underway in the Senate. While the market continues to shrug it off, traders are monitoring the situation for any change in tone.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWill there be new evidence/witnesses at the Senate trial to make it politically significant?,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Alan Ruskin. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that for many voters, the President seems to be the main motivator for voters on both sides of the political spectrum \u2014 for and against. This argument runs along the lines that Trump is running against himself/\u2018the anti-Trump\u2019, and, the election will be heavily impacted by which Democrat candidate least impacts the \u2018anti-Trump\u2019 vote \u2014 a view that some argue tends to support centrists like Biden.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7YCrtpo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9jQCYRG.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXureFC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/3upRv6z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O07l30Z.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BjiCdpH.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/w5fgr9y.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/L81ewyy.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vroSSfA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MMO35Qf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/dCxJl8u.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading Mixed since 1998, But Improving Lately\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 22 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.79% by DJIA to 0.14% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last eight years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef3ff1e52532ea69e189a7cd90e7b27/bf3ce263396269e9-14/s500x750/4fc5ea153df07c1e2ab94f583409f214f2eae3c6.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Closer Look At Election Years\n\n&gt; 2020 is off to a roaring start, picking up right where 2019 left off. Many investors are eyeing the upcoming presidential election as an impending storm for the stock market. In the four-year presidential cycle, pre-election years have tended to be the strongest for stocks, as sitting presidents have taken measures to boost the economy and stock market higher to garner votes. It sure worked out well last year, with the S&amp;P 500 Index\u2019s 31% total return.\n\n&gt; Returns in election years, however, have been quite bifurcated.\n\n&gt; \u201cIf an incumbent president was up for reelection, stocks tended to do extremely well,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOn the other hand, if there was a lame duck president in office, returns were quite muted.\u201d\n\n&gt; Note that a \u201clame duck president\u201d means the sitting president either isn\u2019t running for reelection or has already fulfilled the maximum two terms. It makes sense, as the president could be less motivated to do things to heat up the economy if they know they are leaving office. Possibly, investors may also get cold feet knowing a change is coming. The S&amp;P 500 was down in 2000 and 2008, and the sitting president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d both years.\n\n&gt; In the LPL Chart of the Day, we break down election years by whether the president was running for reelection or a lame duck. The chart shows the S&amp;P 500 up an impressive 11.7% on average if the President was running for reelection, compared to up an average of 2.4% if president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d.\n\n&gt; Given most presidents who have run a second time have tended to win, this could be the market\u2019s way of saying it is comfortable with the status quo over change.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another encouraging historical trend is that the S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t been lower during an election year with an incumbent president up for reelection since 1940. To be clear, stocks have been up during election years when the incumbent president actually lost. In 1980, the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 26%, but Jimmy Carter still lost to Ronald Reagan. In other words, this does support the notion of higher stocks in 2020, but higher stocks can\u2019t always tell you who will win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Q4 Earnings Season is All About 2020\n\n&gt; Fourth quarter earnings season kicked off this week with 24 S&amp;P 500 Index companies slated to report results. Our expectations are for a marginal increase in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis, based on current FactSet consensus estimates (-2% year over year) and the average historical upside of roughly 3 percentage points.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve become accustomed to meager earnings growth. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if fourth quarter results are anywhere near expectations, 2019 will end up as a year with S&amp;P 500 returns of more than 30% and no corporate earnings growth to speak of. That means expanding stock valuations drove the market\u2019s gains last year, a trend we do not expect to continue.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Earnings-blog-011520-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWe expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWith valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Accordingly, the key to this reporting season will be whether the optimistic growth outlook reflected in consensus earnings estimates for this year remains intact after companies issue guidance. Many companies will be commenting on 2020 for the first time. Our estimate of $175 per share in S&amp;P 500 EPS for the entire year represents a 6\u20137% increase from our $165 forecast for 2019. Based on the latest consensus estimates, that growth rate may get pushed up a bit. We still think $175 is attainable if capital investment picks up after stalling last year and wage growth remains stable.\n\n&gt; Trade progress may help. The United States and China will sign the phase-one trade deal later today. While negotiations on the next phase will be tougher and could even stall out, businesses would welcome the additional clarity that de-escalation can provide, something that clearly weighed on corporate profits last year.\n\n*****\n\n# January Off To Stronger Than Usual Start \u2013 But 2nd Half Is Weaker\n\n&gt; Stocks are off to a stronger that usual so far in January 2020 when compared in the chart above to the average performance over the most recent 21-year period. As of today\u2019s close DJIA is up 1.41%, S&amp;P 500 +1.61%, NASDAQ leads the pack +3.11% and the Russell 2000 was in the red until the past two days and is now up 0.44%. This is well above historical average performance in recent Januarys.\n\n&gt; The market was up nicely today until reports hit the newswires at about 1:30 pm ET creating uncertainty that the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed tomorrow between the US and China may be pabulum. The realization that the tariffs on Chinese goods may remain in place until after the election as the review process runs its course drove stocks lower this afternoon. The market gave back most of its early gains with only the Dow and Russell 2000 eking out gains today.\n\n&gt; However, as you can see in the dotted lines so far in 2020 the indices are tracking the last 21-years rather closely. If the pattern continues to pan out this year, look for a little strength over the next two days. Then weakness has been prone to appear just after mid-month after the eleventh trading day with mild average losses from on or around the eleventh trading day to the fourteenth trading day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2f102c5c61bd803b4bc407e8c4812e3/1b34c8a8e7ad3e39-e9/s500x750/829ff7ea82b52109b737d17e4b24cb0a4d28e434.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Jackpot for Stocks\n\n&gt; Solid across the board gains this year have put another January Trifecta Jackpot in our sights for 2020. So far our January Trifecta is two for two. Our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system came in positive up 0.7% on January 8 following up on a positive reading for our Santa Claus Rally (SCR) on January 3. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month\u2019s end.\n\n&gt; We just published an update on The Incredible January Barometer: Only 11 Major Errors in 82 Years that runs through the reasons behind the efficacy of the January. We discuss how the passage of the Twentieth \u201cLame Duck\u201d Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 created the January Barometer. We also compare the January Barometer results along with the full year results, the following eleven months results, and the subsequent twelve months results to all other \u201cMonthly Barometers\u201d using the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite\n\n&gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table below). In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing \u201cLast 11 Mon\u201d years, in the table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 \u201319.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.\n\n&gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain decent. Of the last 10 times since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.\n\n&gt; A positive SCR and FFD are encouraging and further clarity will be gained when the January Barometer (page 16, 2020 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac) reports at month\u2019s end. A positive January Barometer would certainly boost prospects for full-year 2020. The December Low Indicator (2020 STA, page 34) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow\u2019s December Closing Low of 27502.81 on 12/3/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1bcaf64028a60761e27f90b96cd50a5/be57098a98452149-c8/s500x750/8bde32d516bf2811adabb784ab6de926796ad504.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equities Closing In On A Breakout\n\n&gt; Below is a chart of the Bloomberg World Equity Market index, which is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 publicly listed companies around the world (including the US). While the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 15% from its January 2018 high, it's notable that we still haven't seen equities break out on a global scale. As shown, the Bloomberg World Index is now just a hair below its prior all-time highs (22 basis points to be exact).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-BBG-World.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-SP-5-years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Three Months And Counting Since Last 1% Decline\n\n&gt; It has now been over three months since the S&amp;P 500's last decline of 1% or more back on 10/9. While it seems like an eternity, the current streak of 67 trading days is nowhere near any sort of record on either a long or short-term basis. The chart below shows historical streaks without a decline of 1%+ for the S&amp;P 500 dating back to 1928. The record for the longest streak was back in 1963 when the S&amp;P 500 went 174 trading days - a full eight months - without a 1% drop. Even more impressive is the fact that in both the 1950s and 1960s there were numerous streaks of 100 or more days. For a decade that is looked back on as one with a lot of upheaval in the US, the 1960s was a period of relative calm for the equity market.\n\n&gt; More recently, the current streak of 67 trading days doesn't look all that impressive relative to streaks we saw back in 2017 and 2018. Right after the election in 2016 and into March of 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had a 109-day streak without a 1% decline, and then from late 2017 through January 2018, there was another streak of 112 trading days without a 1% drop. Even in October 2018, there was another streak of 74 trading days. In other words, in just the last three years there have been three longer streaks without a 1% decline than the current one. In the S&amp;P 500's history, there have been 26 other streaks that have been as long or longer than the current one, and half of those went on to last at least 100 trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011420-Streaks-Without-a-1-Percent-Decline.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 17th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$TAL** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$TEAM** \n&gt; * **$KMI** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SWKS** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$MBWM** \n&gt; * **$TXN** \n&gt; * **$COF** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$UNP** \n&gt; * **$AMTD** \n&gt; * **$FNB** \n&gt; * **$SBNY** \n&gt; * **$RCI** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$STM** \n&gt; * **$AUB** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$BKR** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$NAVI** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$APH** \n&gt; * **$NTRS** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$TER** \n&gt; * **$ZION**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/cCUTW9b.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/HZqsu6j.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.
