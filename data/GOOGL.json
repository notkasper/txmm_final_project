This is my personal observation. \n\nTo make the post more interesting let me introduce a grading or tier system for Alphabets various products\n\nTier 1 - Supreme Monopoly\n\nTier 2 - Monopoly but competition exist \n\nTier 3 - Excellent market share but not a monopoly \n\nTier 4 - Good market share but somewhat far from the big boys\n\nTier 5 - Decent market share and significantly far away from the mainstream products. \n\nTier 6 - Future Potential\n\nYesterday, GOOGL closed at 1757.76 and GOOG closed at 1758.72. Current P/E ratio is 35.42 and 35.47 respectively. S&amp;P 500 average P/E ratio at market close is at 37.56. Cheap tech stock what! \n\nI am gonna try my best to justify why Alphabet is that one stock you buy and hold forever, Alphabet is a safe bet, pun intended.\u00a0\n\nAs mentioned above, we will divide Alphabet into levels or tiers, with tier 1 product being the supreme one, supreme product is something that is irreplaceable and competition is not possible unless a company messes it up themself.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA company is absolutely safe for investment if they have a moat that is almost impossible to beat. For example, Amazon! there online retail business is almost impossible to beat. Because investment alone won't be enough to out do what they have achieved, amazon has amazing delivery time logistics, lots of products and so on.\u00a0\n\nThen there are monopolies that a competitor can challenge for example google maps! we have apple maps and recently amazon announced AWS maps for company use.\u00a0\n\nSo what does Alphabet has that is unbeatable that is Level 1.\u00a0\n\n you might think ''google search'', but the\u00a0\n\nanswer is Youtube.\u00a0\n\nYoutube is a beast like no other, the thing is a product becomes indispensable when money is not the only investment involved. Billions of hours of our lives is on this platform. From tutorials to how to videos to live shows to TV shows to News Channels to personal video to everythinggggggg. Youtube is essential and no matter how much money a competitor throws for a competing product it aint gonna be worth it because not only it will be extremely expensive to set up the data centres required and to maintain at the level of Youtube but more importantly you are also relying on people to invest there time in it in the form of uploads and to ditch an established streaming service in favour of something new.\u00a0A variable not in your control. Based on this absolute monopoly alone that very few companies in the world possess Alphabet is a buy and hold forever! \n\nIn contrast Google search for example is a monopoly at the moment and probably will always remain the number 1 search platform in the world but companies left and right release competitive products such as bing because the only investment required here is money.\u00a0\n\nAnd Youtube has not achieved its full potential yet, there is still room for growth, especially as it moves towards a subscription based model and then you have the Youtube TV/Google TV product in USofA, wait till that becomes mainstream.\u00a0\n\nI think inn the near Future streaming services like Netflix, Disney plus, Prime TV on one side and Youtube alone on other side (because there is no one like Youtube) will dominate and TV channels will slowly get absorb into them.\u00a0 \n\nNow what about Alphabets other monopolies: Google search, Chrome, Android, Google maps, Gmail. I mean they are the best products in what they offer but they have pretty good competition namely bing, internet explorer/Firefox (love chrome as it over took Internet explorer), iOS, Apple maps, outlook. But having said that these products are likely to lead their respective markets although they will share the customers with their competitors. All of these products are monopoly level products but given they have good competition we label them as Level 2 product. \n\nNow let's talk about tier 3 products. Again these are the products that are extremely good but the market leader is someone else. Alphabet has amazing products in this tier that are providing revenues in the billions such as Google Cloud Platform(GCP) on one hand and on the other extreme with modest revenue Google Nest products. \n\nGCP is too big to be named in the same breadth as the other products here, the revenue that GCP\u00a0 is projected to grow is significant, especially in comparison to other Alphabet revenue sources. If you look at the last quarter, 2020 Q3, GCP brought in 3.44 billion dollars, this is a 45% year over year growth in GCP revenue! pretty sweet; plus by 2025 Cloud market is projected to triple in revenue and hence GCP will be responsible for a bigger chunk of the parent company's revenue, currently it sits around 10% of the total revenue.\n\n Other products at level 3 includes google sheets/slides/docs (An excellent alternative to MS office. Its free! but it's unlikely to challenge Microsoft's monopoly in this regard. Office is such a strong moat even though it is a paid service, google sheets etc will likely remain number 2 in this game)\n\n please note Many of Google products come under the domain of Android and I have made a conscious effort to not name them separately unless they have a massive presence of their own.\n\n another notable entry here, in the near future, will be the fitbit smartwatch (Once that long awaited deal goes through World wide) \u00a0\n\nNow we bring our attention to tier 4 products. Again these are those products that are pretty good but are slightly far away at the moment from the main competition. This includes other Google hardware products such as Chromebooks and Pixel Phones. I am sure it won't be long before these products will move up to Level 3 but are unlikely to gain significant market share in the presence of Apple and Samsung. \n\nLevel 5 includes those products that are far away from the main competing brands, a good example includes the Stadia. Which, frankly speaking is amazing but is very unlikely to reach the likes of Nintendo, Microsoft or Sony. Unless Alphabet buys big developers or something. \n\nLevel 6 includes those potential products that might have a huge impact in the future, obviously we are talking about Alphabets moonshot division X. X has a lot of projects, I will briefly touch 4 of them. Waymo is the front runner here, followed by Verily, Deepmind and Quantum computer.\u00a0\n\nWaymo main competition I think is Tesla. Not sure who is gonna come on top but one thing is for sure Waymo will have a significant market share. \n\nVerily is all about using Alphabets massive data for medicine, and Pharmaceutical companies are already paying verily for it's data to fine tune there future products. \n\nDeepmind another example of Alphabet's commitment to medicine, using Alphabet AI research to predict how a protein folds. Leading to a new chapter of medicine research and development. \n\nFinally and the project that is in it's infancy. Quantum computing is as fantastic, as tremendous as Elon's SpaceX mission to Mars. It will be at least a decade before we start understanding and making products with QC. But if successful, it will have the highest potential out of all X's projects. \n\nIf Alphabets projected is achieved than EPS will likely double in around 5-6 years time. Stock price should at least double as well. \n\nThere you have it folks.

And just between us, I\u2019m about to add a new high-momentum holding that\u2019s the talk of Wall Street. Who knew investing through an S&amp;P 500 index fund could turn me into such a market swashbuckler?\n\nMy standouts, of course, are tech\u2019s Bunyanesque five: Apple \ufffc (ticker: AAPL), Microsoft \ufffc (MSFT), Amazon.com \ufffc (AMZN), Alphabet \ufffc (GOOGL), and Facebook  \ufffc(FB). The S&amp;P 500 weights companies by size, which means when I jump into a trend trade without realizing it, I apparently like to go big. Earlier this month, these five briefly made up 25% of my index fund. That dwarfs the 18% weighting held by the stars of the dot-com stock bubble two decades ago.\n\nNow here comes Tesla \ufffc (TSLA). The caretakers of the S&amp;P 500 say they will add the stock to the index just before Christmas. By all appearances, they\u2019re not so much rolling out a welcome mat as they are diving out of the way while Tesla founder Elon Musk jumps a CybertruckDukes-of-Hazzard-style over the security gate and through the front door.\n\nSee, just over a year ago, when Tesla passed General Motors \ufffc (GM) to become the most valuable U.S. car company, its absence in the S&amp;P 500 was already glaring. But Tesla wasn\u2019t yet consistently profitable. What if its stock value turned out to be temporary market puffery? S&amp;P passed. Since then, customer demand for Tesla has been fierce, and profits, convincing. Also, Tesla stock is up another 775%.\n\nTesla is now more valuable than most major car makers combined. A year ago, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway \ufffc (BRK.B) could have paid cash to buy Tesla\u2014twice. This past week, the car maker passed Berkshire Hathaway in market value to become the sixth-largest U.S. company.\n\nI\u2019m trying not to resort to using outdated investing tools, like skepticism and math. But now that S&amp;P is about to make Tesla one of my top retirement holdings, I\u2019m wondering two things. First, what does the bull case look like from here? Tesla\u2019s value is now so high that car-making profits alone, even looking out a decade and assuming massive market-share gains, might not be enough. Where will the other money come from? And second, if Tesla\u2019s stock rise falters, can my S&amp;P 500 fund still shine?\n\nAs for bull cases, those are becoming a bit easier to find. Among analysts who cover Tesla, 35% now say to buy shares, recently near $600. That\u2019s up from 19% who said to buy back during the March stock downturn, when Tesla fell below $100, split-adjusted.\n\nAdam Jonas at Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight on Nov. 18, predicting 22% upside, to $540. The stock delivered that in just four days. Not to worry: Jonas also has a separate \u201cbull case\u201d price target, which assumes things go even better than the \u201cbase case\u201d behind his Overweight rating. That price target is $1,068, suggesting plenty of upside potential left.\n\nMore interesting than targets is the thinking behind them. Jonas\u2019 base case for Tesla assumes its sales will rise to 3.8 million vehicles in the year 2030, with operating margins of just over 12%. Bull case: eight million vehicles, with 20% margins. Compare either of those with the one million electric vehicles Jonas expects General Motors to sell in 2030, and you get a sense of why GM recently announced a surge in EV spending.\n\nMore interesting still is that Tesla\u2019s core car business accounts for only 43% of Jonas\u2019s bull-case target. He expects that Tesla will eventually make more profit per vehicle selling network services and insurance than from selling the vehicles themselves. Tesla buyers today can pay thousands extra for full self-driving capability, or to unlock faster acceleration, or to upgrade infotainment systems on older vehicles. There\u2019s talk of a subscription plan for battery charging. And so on.\n\nAll of that starts to sound rather Apple-like. One thing that has helped propel the iPhone maker\u2019s shares from 15 times earnings two years ago to nearly 30 times earnings now is that it has ramped up sales of high-margin services, such as cloud storage and streaming, to its vast user base, and it takes a cut of software sales through its App Store.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives says Tesla\u2019s gains have also been driven by explosive growth in China, where it has a massive new factory to make Model 3 sedans and Model Y midsize SUVs. Ives says China could account for 40% of demand in just two years. That adds risk of a trade breakdown between the U.S. and China, of course. Ives also expects sales to surge in Europe amid a regulatory push for lower carbon emissions. \u201cWe\u2019re going into a golden age of EV demand,\u201d he says.\n\nThat makes me feel a little better about being force-fed Tesla stock via index fund next month. But what if it turns out I\u2019m getting in at the top? Maybe value stocks can help make up for it. Value stocks have been outperforming the rest of the S&amp;P 500 since Pfizer \ufffc (PFE) announced excellent results for an experimental Covid-19 vaccine earlier this month.\n\nIf life begins returning to normal sometime next year, the thinking goes, Old Economy stocks that have been hit hard by the pandemic can rebound. Goldman Sachs recently calculated that if shares of the aforementioned five tech giants fall 10% from here, while shares of the remaining S&amp;P 500 members rise 10%, the net result would be a gain for the overall index of 5%. If the tech giants merely stall instead of decline, and the rest rise 20%, the index would gain 16%.\n\nI\u2019m still working the numbers on what happens if Tesla stock climbs another 700% by Easter, while everything else falls.

Roblox RBLX acknowledged in its official paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it is experiencing a huge boost from users isolated during shelter-in-place policies related to coronavirus, but seeks to appeal to a wider, and older, audience to continue growing when things go back to \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nRoblox originally filed for an IPO on Nov. 19, after disclosing a month before that it was beginning the process. Roblox said in the original filing that it sought to raise up to $1 billion; this figure is typically a placeholder that will be updated in later filings, but suggests a larger fundraising goal than the typical large IPO, which uses a $100 million target.\n\nRoblox expects to trade under the ticker \u201cRBLX\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange. There are six banks underwriting the deal, led by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and J.P. Morgan. 2020 has been a good year for IPOs with the Renaissance IPO ETF IPO up 94% for the year to date, compared with a 12% gain in the S&amp;P 500 index SPX , and a 35% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP .\n\nHere are five things to know about Roblox as it becomes a public company.\n\n1. If you don\u2019t have tweens, you\u2019ve probably never heard of it\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of Roblox, you probably haven\u2019t been around a pre-teen much in recent years. The company said that more than half of its 31.1 million daily users are younger than 13 years old. Back in 2018, the service claimed about 12 million daily users.\n\nSince most online accounts require users to be at least 13, the company has faced criticism for inappropriate content on its service. In the prospectus, Roblox said it uses a human review team to screen content and has reviewed more than 68 million \u201cassets\u201d in the first nine months, and has \u201chad a human respond\u201d to more than 9 million customer inquiries within 10 minutes on average. The company hopes to appeal to older users and to retain current users as they grow up.\n\n\u201cWe ultimately aim to be a brand that serves all ages,\u201d the company said in its SEC filing. \u201cAn early sign of what is possible: our 17 to 24-year-old user age group grew faster than our core under 13 age group in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u201d\n\n2. COVID-19 generated a huge boost of traffic\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, Roblox growth exploded as tweens and others who were sheltering in place flocked to the online community. The number of daily users surged 82% over the past 12 months and the average user was on the service for more than two-and-a-half hours a day.\n\n\u201cWe have experienced rapid growth \u2026 given our users have been online more as a result of global COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies,\u201d the company said.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2020, Roblox said DAUs, or daily average users, grew to 31.1 million from 17.1 million in the same period during 2019. Year-over-year, Roblox reported 17.6 million DAUs in 2019, compared with 12 million in 2018.\n\nSimilarly, total hours spent on Roblox more than doubled to 22.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with 10 billion in the same period in 2019. Year-over-year, users spent 13.7 billion hours on Roblox in 2019, versus 9.4 billion in 2018.\n\n3. Its revenue is derived from the model that has Epic Games fighting Apple\n\nRoblox makes money by using a virtual currency called \u201cRobux\u201d that users buy to upgrade avatar and make purchases, but that developers also use within the platform. That means Roblox pays a lot of money to third-party distributors like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. at a time when those practices are being disputed by others.\n\nBack in August, the popular videogame \u201cFortnite,\u201d made by Epic Games, was banned from Apple\u2019s AAPL App Store and Alphabet\u2019s GOOG GOOGL Google Play stores because Epic tried to work around the 30% cuts the companies were getting from in-game purchases, and loudly disputed the practice.\n\nRoblox said it also pays 30% of its one-time purchases to both Apple and Google when they are made on the respective stores. The company said for the first nine months of 2020, 34% of its revenue came from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases. That\u2019s compared with 30% of revenue from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases in 2019.\n\nThe company said its bookings surged 171% to $1.24 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with $458 million in the same period in 2019. From 2018 to 2019, bookings grew 39%. If defines bookings as \u201csales of our virtual currency which we record as deferred revenue and then recognize that revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user.\u201d\n\nBooking per DAU rose to $39.93 in the first nine months of 2020 from $26.75 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIn a nod to COVID-19\u2019s part in the surge, the company said: \u201cWe do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline.\u201d\n\n4. As revenue has soared, losses have widened\n\nWhile Roblox reported a 68% surge in revenue for the first nine months of 2020, losses for the period more than quadrupled.\n\nRoblox reported revenue of $588.7 million and a loss of $203.2 million in the period, compared with $349.9 million in revenue and a loss of $46.3 million for the first nine months of 2019. Roblox reported revenue of$488.2 million and a narrower loss of $86 million in 2019, compared with revenue of $312.8 million and a loss of $97.2 million in 2018.\n\nThe biggest culprits in 2020\u2019s widening loss were payments to content developers and administration fees connected with the run up to the IPO.\n\n\u201cDeveloper exchange fees track closely with our overall bookings performance as more users on the platform and Robux purchased by our users drives more Robux earned by developers and creators,\u201d the company said in its filing.\n\nThose fees soared 190% to $209.2 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared with the same period a year ago.\n\nIn the same period, general and administrative fees soared 125% to $64.9 million. While $27.7 million of that increase was due to higher personnel costs including stock-based compensation expenses, the company also cited \u201can increase in headcount in our finance, accounting, people, IT and legal functions associated with our anticipated public offering.\u201d\n\n5. Early investors get a big upper hand\n\nThe IPO is for Class A shares, which get one vote per share, as opposed to Class B shares that get 20 votes per share and are convertible to Class A shares.\n\nThose Class B shares belong mostly to early investors, the first of which were Altos Ventures and First Round Capital. Altos has a 23.9% stake in the company with 114.3 million shares and First Round has a 7% stake with 33.6 million shares.\n\nLater investors include Meritech Capital Partners and Index Ventures. Meritech owns an 11.6% stake at 55.3 million shares, while Index has an 11.1% stake at 53.1 million shares.\n\nTiger Global Management, which entered the picture in 2018, has an 8.2% stake at 39.3 million shares.\n\nEarlier in the year, Andreessen Horowitz led a $150 million investment round in the company but doesn\u2019t even break into the list of \u201cgreater than 5%\u201d stockholders. \n\n[Source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/roblox-ipo-5-things-to-know-about-the-tween-centric-gaming-platform-11606499231)", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 931861, "public", "self", "Roblox IPO: 5 things to know about the tween-centric gaming platform", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k286yz/roblox_ipo_5_things_to_know_about_the/", "all_ads", 6, 1606502790.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Brothanogood", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_d29iz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606506390, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k286yz/roblox_ipo_5_things_to_know_about_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k286yz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "news", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "866eb162-65e6-11e5-a903-1252b640afe9", "link_flair_text": "News", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 62, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/k286yz/roblox_ipo_5_things_to_know_about_the/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "tpIMnlKEYIYYx2yRVynuo1qbcZxnAK9Myre0GAWUGi4", "resolutions": [{"height": 54, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ba8c59d74e8ff6e92f6ac36181a0b05bec1d4a3", "width": 108}, {"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11dd624a0f2c6cf9001ea1c3cabafd71efedc018", "width": 216}, {"height": 160, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bac411c45daeb5adf984022b95fa39bf4cdf3721", "width": 320}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cc34167a5424a2b3dd89482d4d374b73a1b2e67", "width": 640}, {"height": 480, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c75ba6b59a03006dd5447e0a903e54b185e86562", "width": 960}, {"height": 540, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1116b460b4deec6c16b600251673f6bef66a9536", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 640, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b4b2253c418f739208498d73d43dd9966967519d", "width": 1280}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1606506401, "score": 1, "selftext": "Roblox Corp. is planning an initial public offering amid strong momentum as millions of tweens and teenagers are glued to their mobile devices during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe San Mateo, Calif.-based gaming platform features a variety of \u201c3-D digital worlds\u201d that are built by users and developers, providing virtual communities where users can play with friends.

That\u2019s compared with 30% of revenue from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases in 2019.\n\nThe company said its bookings surged 171% to $1.24 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with $458 million in the same period in 2019. From 2018 to 2019, bookings grew 39%. If defines bookings as \u201csales of our virtual currency which we record as deferred revenue and then recognize that revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user.\u201d\n\nBooking per DAU rose to $39.93 in the first nine months of 2020 from $26.75 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIn a nod to COVID-19\u2019s part in the surge, the company said: \u201cWe do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline.\u201d\n\n4. As revenue has soared, losses have widened\n\nWhile Roblox reported a 68% surge in revenue for the first nine months of 2020, losses for the period more than quadrupled.\n\nRoblox reported revenue of $588.7 million and a loss of $203.2 million in the period, compared with $349.9 million in revenue and a loss of $46.3 million for the first nine months of 2019. Roblox reported revenue of$488.2 million and a narrower loss of $86 million in 2019, compared with revenue of $312.8 million and a loss of $97.2 million in 2018.\n\nThe biggest culprits in 2020\u2019s widening loss were payments to content developers and administration fees connected with the run up to the IPO.\n\n\u201cDeveloper exchange fees track closely with our overall bookings performance as more users on the platform and Robux purchased by our users drives more Robux earned by developers and creators,\u201d the company said in its filing.\n\nThose fees soared 190% to $209.2 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared with the same period a year ago.\n\nIn the same period, general and administrative fees soared 125% to $64.9 million. While $27.7 million of that increase was due to higher personnel costs including stock-based compensation expenses, the company also cited \u201can increase in headcount in our finance, accounting, people, IT and legal functions associated with our anticipated public offering.\u201d\n\n5. Early investors get a big upper hand\n\nThe IPO is for Class A shares, which get one vote per share, as opposed to Class B shares that get 20 votes per share and are convertible to Class A shares.\n\nThose Class B shares belong mostly to early investors, the first of which were Altos Ventures and First Round Capital. Altos has a 23.9% stake in the company with 114.3 million shares and First Round has a 7% stake with 33.6 million shares.\n\nLater investors include Meritech Capital Partners and Index Ventures. Meritech owns an 11.6% stake at 55.3 million shares, while Index has an 11.1% stake at 53.1 million shares.\n\nTiger Global Management, which entered the picture in 2018, has an 8.2% stake at 39.3 million shares.\n\nEarlier in the year, Andreessen Horowitz led a $150 million investment round in the company but doesn\u2019t even break into the list of \u201cgreater than 5%\u201d stockholders. \n\n[Source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/roblox-ipo-5-things-to-know-about-the-tween-centric-gaming-platform-11606499231)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 931861, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Roblox IPO: 5 things to know about the tween-centric gaming platform", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k286yz/roblox_ipo_5_things_to_know_about_the/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1606502790.0}], [[], false, "buu_jr", null, [], null, "text", "t2_12s2vs", false, false, [], false, false, 1606328316, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k0xjk5/analyzing_stock_why_i_think_google_googl_stock_is/", {}, "k0xjk5", false, false, false, false, false, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 0, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/k0xjk5/analyzing_stock_why_i_think_google_googl_stock_is/", false, "self", {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Ucl4wE_-v34pC3I6zySTtd2FsFs8wspjD4Hny-4dqBU", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/emJyjaYEG8T5tBQ7coZCKdL8Qk-2omDm35YMGrlstdE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a658b851b9feae952fe7aa3ea430106e9b1b2e4", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/emJyjaYEG8T5tBQ7coZCKdL8Qk-2omDm35YMGrlstdE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de3d2e6691f109cf36c31f3a194b3de279f1466a", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/emJyjaYEG8T5tBQ7coZCKdL8Qk-2omDm35YMGrlstdE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00cc2a7cc509e6db68fe60aca3d9bd4b02c73961", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/emJyjaYEG8T5tBQ7coZCKdL8Qk-2omDm35YMGrlstdE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=2ec4b337176fa0a47415fec865512da8e56dd657", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, 6, "moderator", 1606328327, 1, "[removed]", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 926412, "public", "self", "Analyzing Stock -

Still, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs, the five largest U.S. tech companies actually aren\u2019t overvalued.\n\nFirst off, these stocks\u2014Facebook \ufffc (ticker: FB), Apple \ufffc (AAPL), Amazon \ufffc (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft \ufffc (MSFT)\u2014are up about 49% year-to-date on average. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 is up just under 12% for the year. Before Sept. 2, these five stocks had an average multiple on the next two years of earnings of roughly 35 times, against 12 times for the other 495 stocks on the S&amp;P 500, according to Goldman Sachs data. That was the widest valuation gap between the group and the broader market since 2000\u2014before the tech bubble burst.\n\nLately, investors have taken note of the drastic surge in the five stocks\u2019 valuations. Since September 2, the group is down about 3% on average. Meanwhile, large-cap value stocks, judging by the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (VOOV), have climbed 5.2%. Now, the so-called FAAMG group is trading at roughly 31 times earnings, compared with 20 times for the other 495 stocks.\n\nMany on Wall Street are wary of big tech as these multiples would seem bound to continue falling after their meteoric rise this year, and as interest rates rise when the economy starts to see a more solid recovery. Tech stocks, after all, would see less of a benefit from a firming economy. Mostly, growth stocks such as these five tend to have idiosyncratic revenue drivers that aren\u2019t affected by changes in the economy\u2014while the revenues of value stocks like consumer discretionary are very much tied to consumer spending trends and economic growth.\n\nEvercore strategists recently said they only see S&amp;P 500 gains of roughly 5% in the next year or so because they don\u2019t expect big tech to outperform the way it has in recent history.\n\nBut David Kostin, Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief US equity strategist, argues in a note that \u201cfundamentals support higher valuation for FAAMG.\u201d\n\nKostin noted that the near-term earnings outlook for FAAMG stocks supports the current valuations. Goldman is looking for S&amp;P 500 companies to post a median annual earnings per share growth of 8% for the next few years. The tech group is expected to see EPS growth of about 17%.\n\nComparing these companies\u2019 earnings multiples to their near-term earnings growth rates\u2014which many analysts do to determine how fair a valuation is\u2014further justifies Kostin\u2019s point. Facebook\u2019s PEG ratio\u2014calculated by taking the stock\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio and dividing by its projected earnings growth rate\u2014is 1.2 times, roughly in line with in its five-year average of 1.1, according to data from FactSet. Amazon\u2019s PEG ratio is 1.6 times, notably lower than its five-year average of 2.4. Alphabet\u2019s PEG is at 1.9 against an average of 1.5, although its five-year high is above 2. Microsoft\u2019s PEG is 2, in line with its average. Apple is the most overvalued by the metric, with a PEG of 2.6 against an average of 1.5.\n\nWith the exception of Apple, these companies are expected to see EPS compound an annual rate between the midteens in percentage terms to above 30%. If investors are willing to pay top dollar for these stocks, earnings growth could continue to take them higher.\n\nAll five have dominant platforms that create seemingly endless synergies. Amazon\u2019s new online drug business, for example, offers perks to their roughly 70 million Prime members. This can drive adoption of the new offering, but can also drive new prime customers.\n\nThe point is tech stocks are pricey for good reason\u2014don\u2019t count them out.\n\nSource: Barron's", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 915427, "public", "self", "Facebook, Apple and Other Big Tech Stocks Aren\u2019t Too Expensive.

opened today\u2019s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe.\n\nAfter an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up.\n\nOn Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus \n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until \u201cat least 2023\u201d. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed\u2019s monetary support. In early October, Powell said, \u201ctoo little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000. While this estimate would the sixth month of net payroll gains, it would also be the four, straight month of deceleration, indicating the pace of recovery is slowing. The unemployment rate is also predicted to tick lower, from 7.9% to 7.6%. However, worryingly, there appears to be a trend towards long-term unemployment for many Americans. The number of individuals filing continuing claims, people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, has continued to increase the past several weeks. This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly.\n\nThe US just set a new record for the highest seven-day average of daily new cases: 81,336 as of Sunday. That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has increased only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project. \n\nLast week, Europe recorded around 1.5 million new cases of coronavirus, a new record, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. England, in response to the surge, announced a nationwide lockdown for at least the next four weeks.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday an event for Nov. 10 where it\u2019s expected to announce new Macs that are powered by their own chips powered by ARM processors, instead of the Intel chips it had been using.

NIO delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, doubling from a year ago. The result is doubly impressive because NIO very recently raised its manufacturing capacity to 5,000 vehicles a month. The company is selling all the cars it can make. This stock is an absolute monster and is one we love at PsychoTrader!\n* Alibaba (BABA), is doubling its Singles\u2019 Day offerings this year, running the massive online sales event across two periods rather than one. Alibaba says it expanded the shopping window for Singles\u2019 Day to provide more relief for merchants that have been hit hard by the pandemic. Single\u2019s day is a counter to Valentine\u2019s Day that celebrates being single. Normally it\u2019s held on Nov 11. This is the world\u2019s largest shopping festival. According to Fortune Magazine, BABA shipped $38.4 billion in gross merchandise value on Singles\u2019 Day last year. Amazon\u2019s Prime Day, by comparison, sold around $6 billion in goods last year.\n* Asian shares were mostly higher on Monday buoyed by further signs of recovery in China's manufacturing sector.

Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus \n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until \u201cat least 2023\u201d. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed\u2019s monetary support.

But there were more revealing details to be found beneath the headlines.\n\nWaiting for 5G: Let\u2019s start with Apple (ticker: AAPL), still the largest company on Earth by market capitalization, but now worth less than $2 trillion as its shares have fallen 20% from their 2000 high. This was an awkward quarter for Apple. Investors are buzzed about the new iPhone 12 line, but the phones have just started shipping, and weren\u2019t available in the September quarter. Apple CEO Tim Cook said iPhone sales in the quarter beat internal expectations, but they were a little shy of Wall Street consensus estimates. Worrisome was a sharp drop in sales in \u201cGreater China.\u201d They fell 29% from a year ago. The apparent issue: China is ahead of the U.S. on 5G, and other phone makers already have 5G phones on the market. Would you buy a 4G phone now? Didn\u2019t think so.\n\nApple didn\u2019t give formal guidance, but it gave some solid hints. It expects iPhone sales to rise year over year, despite the late start for the new iPhones, with double-digit revenue growth for every other hardware line and services. Apple also expects a return to growth in China. And, by the way: Macs, iPads, and Wearables together generated almost $24 billion in sales in the quarter, up a combined 30% year over year. On a run-rate basis, Apple\u2019s non-iPhone hardware this quarter will surpass $100 billion. Services is approaching $60 billion. Apple bought back $18 billion of stock in the quarter. Stop worrying; Apple will be fine.\n\nShop! In the Name of Love: U.S. online holiday shopping is expected to grow 33% this year to $189 billion, according to a report last week from Adobe Systems \ufffc, based on data gathered from 80 of the 100 largest online retailers. Amazon (AMZN) didn\u2019t need to read that report. The e-commerce giant posted 39% sales growth in North America in the September quarter. But profit-margin guidance for the fourth quarter gave investors pause: Amazon expects to have $4 billion in Covid-related costs in the quarter, up from $2.5 billion in the third quarter. Also, this year Prime Day fell in the fourth quarter; Amazon notes that those aren\u2019t the company\u2019s highest-margin sales. But let\u2019s not forget that Amazon crushed operating-income guidance for the September quarter. It wouldn\u2019t be shocking if it did it again. Amazon vowed last week to hire 100,000 temporary workers for the holidays. No company has benefited more from the acceleration in online shopping.\n\nBuy Stuff Now! Online-ad platforms are also benefiting from the e-commerce surge. Amazon had \u201cother revenue\u201d\u2014mostly ads\u2014of $5.4 billion in the quarter, up 50%. eBay \ufffc\u2019s [EBAY] ad revenue rose 77% in the period. Snap \ufffc [SNAP] and Pinterest \ufffc [PINS] recently posted ad-driven earnings beats, spurring huge stock moves. So it was no surprise that both Alphabet [GOOGL] and Facebook [FB] blew away top-line estimates. Remember the Facebook ad boycott? Heh. It\u2019s not working. Google parent Alphabet has been the megacap laggard this year, with a gain of under 20%, but it was the star Thursday. YouTube alone had $5 billion in ad sales, up 32%. And then there\u2019s Google Cloud.\n\nIn Clouds We Trust: All that hype about the public cloud? It\u2019s understated. Microsoft \ufffc [MSFT] said its commercial cloud business was up 31% in the September quarter\u2014and Azure was up 48%. Amazon Web Services revenue rose 29%; Google Cloud\u2019s jumped 45%. The German enterprise-software giant SAP \ufffc [SAP] slashed its revenue outlook this past week, declaring itself determined to accelerate its cloud transition, and the stock lost more than a quarter of its value. There is a lack of pure plays on the public cloud. You could do worse than owning a basket of Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nDeciphering Jeff: A standard part of every earnings press release is the CEO quote. Usually the boss waxes poetic about the quarter, or raves about the company\u2019s engineers or huge addressable market. Amazon\u2019s release this quarter quotes CEO Jeff Bezos saying that retailers everywhere should match the company\u2019s $15-an-hour minimum-wage rate: \u201cWe hope other large employers will also make the jump to $15. Now would be a great time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a strange quote for an earnings release. A PR move to show Amazon is a solid corporate citizen? An attempt to embarrass lower-paying rivals? It\u2019s weird.\n\nMerlin\u2019s Beard! The loser on Tech Trillions Thursday was Twitter [TWTR]. Earlier in the week, CEO Jack Dorsey was grilled by Senate Republicans who think social networks censor conservative political content. Dorsey appeared on screen for the virtual hearing with a long beard\u2014a little bit Confucius, a little ZZ Top. Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) accused Dorsey of being a pawn of the left, but the senator is worrying about the wrong platform. Twitter added just one million daily average users in the quarter, well below expectations. It has under 200 million users. Facebook\u2019s platforms have a combined 2.5 billion daily actives\u2014about a third of the world\u2019s population. There\u2019s a reason Twitter\u2019s valuation is just 5% of Facebook\u2019s.

Facebook\u2019s platforms have a combined 2.5 billion daily actives\u2014about a third of the world\u2019s population. There\u2019s a reason Twitter\u2019s valuation is just 5% of Facebook\u2019s.

Volatility has dominated markets in the last few weeks, with investors spooked by the uncertainty of the US presidential elections, a record number of coronavirus infections in the US and Europe, and a new wave of lockdowns across Europe.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) performed the worst, ended the day 2.54% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) ended the day 1% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) 0.52% down.\n\nYesterday after-hours, heavily-weighted tech companies, like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) reported their quarterly earnings. Though most reported third-quarter results that exceeded expectations, shares of these companies (except Alphabet) pulled back steeply today. After the strong performance of these stocks compared to the broader market this year, market participants had set their expectations exceptionally high. In other words, traders expected these companies to beat expectations by a much greater margin than they did. The earnings results for all these companies can be found in yesterday\u2019s issue of the daily recap. \n\nToday, the Federal Reserve announced it lowered the minimum loan size for its Main Street lending program to $100,000 from $250,000 and that \u201cfees have been adjusted to encourage the provision of these smaller loans\u201d. Demand for the lending program has been weak thus far, with the Fed having offered just 400 loans totaling $3.7 billion, out of the total $600 billion capacity. As many pundits have pointed out, many small- and mid-sized businesses have stayed on the sidelines from taking on more loans that they would eventually need to pay back during the pandemic.\n\nUnfortunately, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, there were 88,521 new coronavirus infections reported in the US yesterday, another record, and 9,540 more cases than were reported Wednesday. The trend this week is worrying, given that only last Friday, the US set its previous record for daily new infections. According to the Washington Post, The total number of infections reported nationwide since February is virtually guaranteed to reach 9 million on Friday, just 15 days after the tally hit 8 million. At least 228,000 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in the country.\n\nEurope is in the thralls of a second surge in coronavirus, with the continent now accounting for 46% of global cases and nearly a third of total deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO) Spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris, compared to last week, daily cases in Europe have risen by \u201cabout a third\u201d and daily deaths by \u201cclose to 40%\u201d this week. This month, both France and Spain have declared states of emergency, imposing more restrictions to try to ease up pressure on hospital ICU departments. In France, the worst-hit country, more than half of ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.\n\nToday is the last Friday before the US presidential election on Tuesday. Regardless of political leanings, the results of this election are sure to have a massive effect on the stock market, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how markets react to whatever the US decides.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an announcement Friday that it will allow U.S. cruise ships to begin a phased approach to resume sailing in U.S. waters starting this Sunday. \u201cAfter expiration of CDC\u2019s No Sail Order (NSO) on October 31, 2020, CDC will take a phased approach to resume cruise ship passenger operations in U.S. waters,\u201d according to the CDC\u2019s newly published \u201cFramework for Conditional Sailing Order for Cruise Ships.\u201d Cruise stocks spiked immediately following the announcement.\n* Electric automaker Fisker completed its merger and debuted at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. \n* Alphabet's Google must tell a district court how it will respond to a federal antitrust lawsuit by mid-November, with the two sides making initial disclosures later in the month, U.S. Judge Amit Mehta said in a brief order on Friday.\n* Netflix (NFLX) on Thursday announced a price increase for U.S. subscribers. The price of a standard Netflix plan climbs by $1 a month to $13.99, from $12.99. The price for premium plans jumps by $2 a month to $17.99 from $15.99.

Comes after US equities rebounded on Thursday from a big Wednesday selloff. However, S&amp;P on pace for worst week since early September, Nasdaq since March. Weakness largely chalked up to renewed coronavirus concerns, election uncertainty and lack of fiscal stimulus. All sectors lower with tech (AAPL-US ), consumer discretionary (AMZN-US ) trailing. Healthcare, financials, comm services (GOOGL-US ) faring somewhat better. Treasuries little changed to a bit weaker in belly of the curve. Dollar little changed on the major crosses. Gold up 0.6%. WTI crude down 1.8%, on pace for \\~11% weekly decline, worst since late April.\n* **Big tech results have received a lot of the blame for the pullback** even though the group reported beat on revenue and EPS and there did not seem to be any meaningful shift in the very upbeat fundamental and secular growth narratives.

analysts characterized Las Vegas results as soft though Macau better; noted LV strip recovery remains highly uncertain due to reliance on air travel and group/convention business.\n* \\-6.1% **FB-US** (Facebook): Q3 beat big on key metrics with recovery in demand for digital ads the widely discussed tailwind on SMB, eComm, Retail, CPG strength; however, US and Canada users down and company warned they could fall more in Q4; also highlighted risks surrounding privacy changes, regulatory environment; guidance for a big investment ramp another overhang.\n* \\-5.3% **AAPL-US** (Apple): Sep Q revenue and EPS ahead but upside limited, iPhone revenue missed, China soft and company did not provide revenue guidance;

Weakness largely chalked up to renewed coronavirus concerns, election uncertainty and lack of fiscal stimulus. All sectors lower with tech (AAPL-US ), consumer discretionary (AMZN-US ) trailing. Healthcare, financials, comm services (GOOGL-US ) faring somewhat better. Treasuries little changed to a bit weaker in belly of the curve. Dollar little changed on the major crosses. Gold up 0.6%. WTI crude down 1.8%, on pace for \\~11% weekly decline, worst since late April.\n* **Big tech results have received a lot of the blame for the pullback** even though the group reported beat on revenue and EPS and there did not seem to be any meaningful shift in the very upbeat fundamental and secular growth narratives. In terms of some of the sticking points, **AAPL-US** missed on iPhone sales and the later iPhone 12 launch weighed on China, **AMZN-US** guided Q4 operating income below on another $4B of coronavirus investments and **FB-US** highlighted looming risks surrounding engagement, platform changes and regulatory. **GOOGL-US** has bucked the trend with the focus on an ad spending recovery, expense control and upcoming cloud disclosures.\n* Busy earnings outside of big tech. **SBUX-US** beat and saw sequential comp improvement. **SYK-US** saw continued recovery in elective procedures but no guidance. **ATVI-US** beat but Q4 EPS guidance missed. **TEAM-US** revenue growth decelerated. **TWTR-US** beat on ad strength but mDAUs missed and it guided for higher costs. **CVNA-US** missed slightly on retail units. **HIG-US** beat on better margins. **FIVN-US** beat and raised on enterprise momentum. **DECK-US** had a big beat on strength in UGG and HOKA. **COLM-US** missed and guided below. **DVN-US** raised production guidance. **CAKE-US** beat and said comps have improved in Q4.\n* Nothing particularly incremental surrounding some of the higher-profile themes outside of earnings. **Worsening coronavirus trends** in Europe and US continue to grab a lot of headlines and have raised concerns about recovery headwinds. **Election uncertainty** another overhang as Biden's lead in the polls offset by the potential for Trump to deliver another 2016 surprise. **Fiscal stimulus** on the backburner other than the seeming breakdown in the Pelosi-Mnuchin relationship. **Central bank policy support** another area of focus following the ECB though there also continue to be worries about both depleted arsenals and fatigue.\n\n**Notable Gainers:**\n\n* \\+6.2% **RMD-US** (ResMed): FQ1 earnings and revenue beat; noted sequential improvement in core apnea patient volume; analysts positive on better-than-expected sleep improvement amid declining Covid ventilator tailwinds; upgraded at JP Morgan.\n* \\+4.4% **ZEN-US** (Zendesk): Q3 EPS, revenue beat; billings, deferred revenue, cash from operations all better; guided Q4 revenue, operating income

advertiser spend in Search and YouTube, along with continued strength in Google Cloud and Play; takeaways noted YouTube ad growth back near pre-pandemic levels (DR strong and brand spending rebounded); expense control another bright spot; Street also positive on company's plan to provide more disclosure on Google Cloud revenue and profitability.\n* \\+3% **FLEX-US** (Flex): Fiscal Q2 results ahead with company highlighting a coronavirus tailwind for health solutions, a rebound in auto, industrial growth from power solutions and renewables, and better networking and cloud growth (helped offset enterprise IT weakness); guidance ahead of expectations; Street also positive on update on NEXTracker solar business ($1B+ revenues and double digit operating margins).\n* \\+2.5% **CL-US** (Colgate-Palmolive): Q3 EPS, revenue beat; organic growth ahead on big Latin America, Europe upside; guided net and organic sales up MSD against consensus for 2.1% growth; also guided GM ahead; analysts noted GM expansion a record which allowed strong brand investments.\n* \\+2.4% **FIVN-US** (Five9): Q3 EPS, EBITDA, revenue beat on billings upside; announced acquisition of Inference Solutions, terms not disclosed; guided Q4 revenue midpoint ahead, EPS slightly better; upgraded to overweight from equal-weight at Stephens, citing improve revenue growth visibility, faster mid-market/enterprise adoption.\n* \\+1.6% **UAA-US** (Under Armour): Q3 revenue, operating income, EPS all ahead; guided FY20 EPS, revenue ahead of Street; management also highlighted margin growth vs 2019 on channel mix benefits, supply chain efficiencies; analysts positive on MyFitnessPal spinoff as sign of focus on core business, management focus on brand elevations and profitability.\n\n**Notable Decliners:**\n\n* \\-19.5% **TWTR-US** (Twitter): Q3 earnings and revenue beat on stronger advertising though monetizable daily active users sharply missed heightened expectations; noted favorable trends continued through October; analysts highlighted delay of MAP offering into 2021 due to new privacy standards, increased cost commentary for Q4 and pull forward of users during Q1/Q2.\n* \\-17% **COLM-US** (Columbia Sportswear): Q3 earnings and revenue missed with guidance below expectations; noted store traffic well below prior years, supply chain constraints related to Covid, cost containment actions; analysts highlighted weak implied gross margins in Q4 due to expected promotions though larger inventories than peers a potential benefit going into holiday season.\n* \\-9.3% **TEAM-US** (Atlassian): FQ1 earnings and revenue beat; new-customer growth and billings among the bright spots; next-Q guidance a bit weaker than the Street; analysts noted report generally positive but concerns about decelerating growth and lumpiness amid cloud transition.\n* \\-7.5% **MGM-US** (MGM Resorts): Q3 EPS and revenue missed; analysts characterized Las Vegas results as soft though Macau better; noted LV strip recovery remains highly uncertain due to reliance on air travel and group/convention business.\n* \\-6.1% **FB-US** (Facebook): Q3 beat big on key metrics with recovery in demand for digital ads the widely discussed tailwind on SMB, eComm, Retail, CPG strength; however, US and Canada users down and company warned they could fall more in Q4; also highlighted risks surrounding privacy changes, regulatory environment; guidance for a big investment ramp another overhang.\n* \\-5.3% **AAPL-US** (Apple): Sep Q revenue and EPS ahead but upside limited, iPhone revenue missed, China soft and company did not provide revenue guidance; however, other products beat (WFH tailwind) and company was positive on early iPhone 12 read-throughs; Street noted lack of guidance more of a supply issue, still expects a very powerful upgrade cycle and continued to talk up the favorable ecosystem narrative.\n* \\-4.2% **AMZN-US** (Amazon.com): Q3 revenue and operating profit well above consensus; however, Q4 operating income guide below with $4B of coronavirus costs vs $2B+ in Q3; also some focus on fulfillment productivity challenges; however, takeaways still positive, highlighting accelerated structural shift to eCommerce, strong Q4 sales guidance, stable AWS, advertising and subscription growth acceleration.\n\n10:01:07 AM CDT on 30 Oct

On Tuesday, it reported more than 33,400 new cases and 523 coronavirus deaths in 24 hours, as well as a net increase of 74 admissions to intensive care, bringing the total  to 2,918, over half the country's overall capacity of 5,800. French President Emmanuel Macron announced nationwide restrictions for the next four weeks. Germany joined France, imposing its own four-week nationwide lockwide, which includes curfew and restrictions on businesses like gyms, bars, restaurants, hairdressers etc.\n\nYesterday, President Trump publicly acknowledged that an agreement on additional stimulus would not happen until after the election. While he signaled that his administration was still willing to negotiate, with the election a mere 6 days away, the chances of stimulus passing before then are practically zero.\n\nHighlights\n\n* The Volatility Index (VIX), which can be seen as a measure of investor sentiment, shot up 12% today at the time of writing, indicating increased risk aversion among market participants.\n* The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation began holding a hearing with Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai to discuss Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which has helped protect online platforms from liability over user-created content.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) slid 5% today even after reporting better-than-expected Q3 earnings but dropped forecast for revenue from Windows operating system\n* General Electric (GE) outperformed the market today, climbing around 4.5% today, after reporting better-than-expected earnings that surprised Wall Street \n* Microsoft (MSFT) had target raised by:\n   * JPMorgan (JPM) from $245 to $249 at OVERWEIGHT\n   * Piper Sandler from $218 to $245 at OVERWEIGHT\n* Sherwin-Williams (SHW) price target increase by $JPM from $700 to $740 at OVERWEIGHT\n* Xilinx (XLNX) had price target raise by JP Morgan (JPM) from $96 to $138\n* Lululemon (LULU) price target increase by Deutsche Bank $DB from $298 to $396 at BUY.\n* Harley Davidson (HOG)  reiterated by Morgan Stanley (MS) with price target $38 at EQUAL WEIGHT.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 26th, 2020.\n\n# **There\u2019s a big week ahead for the market with an earnings deluge, GDP data and stimulus negotiations  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/theres-a-big-week-ahead-for-the-market-with-an-earnings-deluge-gdp-data-and-stimulus-negotiations.html)**\n*****\n&gt; About a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings, including Apple and Microsoft, but uncertainty around stimulus and the presidential election could loom larger for markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There is also important economic data on the calendar, with a first look at third-quarter gross domestic product Thursday. After the second quarter\u2019s shocking 31.4% decline following coronavirus shutdowns, the economy bounced back with growth of 32.5% expected in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly 170 companies report earnings in the coming week, with a diverse group of blue chips among them, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell, and Merck. There is also a big showing from large tech names. Microsoft reports Tuesday, and Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all report in a small window just after the market close on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFor some of these stocks that have run a long way, the bar for those stock to respond to good earnings is higher,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivative strategy at BTIG.\n*****\n&gt; So far about 85% of S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings beat estimates, about 20 percentage points more than the long term average. Companies have been reporting earnings more than 16% above estimates, and the expectation is that earnings overall will be down about 18%, based on actual results and forecasts, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.95% for the week, breaking a 3-week win streak as coronavirus fiscal negotiations dragged on and tech shares declined.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve offered compromises, the speaker on a number of issues is still dug in,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday. \u201cIf she wants to compromise, there will be a deal. But we\u2019ve made lots of progress in lots of areas, but there\u2019s still some significant areas that we\u2019re working through.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; His comments knocked stocks down a bit midday Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s been a muted reaction to earnings overall,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cSo I\u2019m disappointed, in a way, as a fundamentally focused chief investment officer, that the stimulus saga seems to be what it\u2019s all about day in and day out, hour by hour. It\u2019s the stimulus saga, the election looming and the Covid resurgence. Those three things have sort of made earnings a page four story.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; With a week to go before the Nov. 3 election, the market could be a bit more volatile, especially if the outcome looks increasingly less certain.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to focus on the state of stimulus. It\u2019s going to focus on whether the polls are tightening or widening with regard to the probability of having an unclear outcome, contested outcome or both,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s lead has narrowed slightly but he is still ahead in swing state polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe are experiencing a little bit of the calm before the storm here. I do think we are going to get some 1%, 2% daily moves depending on the news...I think you could see a 3% to 5% down opening the following day [after the election] pretty easily,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cI think the market has grown increasingly comfortable with a cleaner result, even if the cleaner result is an all blue result, which potentially would result in a higher tax regime.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market began to focus more on the possibility of a Democratic sweep, where Democrats take the White House and Congress. That could mean a bigger stimulus package, and some strategists believe tax hikes would be delayed until the economy is on more solid ground.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs we get closer to the election, we\u2019re likely to see more volatility no matter what the outcome,\u201d said Grohowski.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said investors are not adequately hedged for an uncertain outcome. \u201cActive managers have the most net long positions they\u2019ve had in a number of years because they\u2019re fearful of missing a year-end rally,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe options market in no way, shape or form is telling you people are hedged right here. The market is discounting a slight volatility, not expected to be persistent into year end.\u201d\n*****\nEmanuel said the options market indicates investors do expect some volatility but not through year end, as some investors began hedging for several months ago.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat we see by and large is again the bump in volatility. It\u2019s really only anticipating a 2% or 3% move in the market either way, after the election, and then the expectation is to likely moderate after that,\u201d Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; The final trading day of October is on Friday, so there could also be some added volatility as fund managers readjust their portfolios between bonds and stocks. In the past week, Treasury yields broke out of a four-month range. The 10-year yield rose above 0.80% for the first time since June, and while it could move higher, strategists expect its move to be contained.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/67jHHD1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/M13Rd10.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ROEcV0O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zqElHD7.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9iotJBk.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lrNGV86.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xGvBBYL.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tR0QKgZ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iXkAMua.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/80umQkP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4BQenwD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rZFBz4D.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq vs. Dow Outperformance\n\n&gt; You may not realize it, but while the Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up a ridiculous 28% so far in 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still in the red on the year.\n\n&gt; Below is a table showing the Dow and Nasdaq's annual percentage change since 1972 when the Nasdaq came into existence. Were the year to end now, the Nasdaq would be outperforming the Dow by 28.65 percentage points. This would be the third strongest outperformance for the Nasdaq on record and the strongest since 1999 when the spread was 60 percentage points!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/dowavg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/downazpctchg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/spreaduse.png))**\n\n&gt; Below are all years since 1972 in which the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by at least ten percentage points. The Nasdaq has posted an annual gain of 20%+ in seventeen different years, but never in a year when the Dow was in the red. Probably the year that most resembles 2020 in terms of the performance spread is 1979 when the Nasdaq rose 28.11% and the Dow rose just 4.19%. Following that year in 1980, both the Dow and Nasdaq surged again and the Nasdaq outperformed by another 18.9 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Interestingly, of the twelve years where the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by more than ten percentage points, the Nasdaq went on to beat the Dow again in the next year eleven out of twelve times. The only time we've seen the Nasdaq crumble versus the Dow in the following year was in 2000 after 1999's outperformance. In 1999, the Nasdaq beat the Dow by a humongous 60 percentage points. After that large gap, though, the Nasdaq ran out of gas in 2000 and underperformed the Dow by 33 percentage points when the Dot Com Bubble finally burst.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/outperfo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Show Slowing Pace of Economic Recovery\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) Beige Book presented qualitative data that suggested the pace of the economic recovery had been tapering, as we discussed in the LPL Research blog, Beige Book Shows Pace of Recovery is Moderating, but now we have quantitative data that is confirming the survey data. The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) increased 0.7% month over month in September to beat Bloomberg consensus expectations of 0.6%, but slowed after rising 1.4% in August and 2% in July.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the leading indicators are still growing, but at a slower rate than the blistering pace seen in the initial months after emerging from lockdowns.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.23.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Growth in the LEI in September was primarily driven by the improvement in jobless claims, as well as continued strength in building permits for new private housing\u2014a trend that matches the behavioral shifts to accommodate work from home conditions during the pandemic. The pullback in stock prices last month and manufacturers\u2019 new orders were the lone detractors from the LEI in September.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt comes as no surprise that growth began to level off after the surge over the summer, and the softer LEI print is suggesting the economy could be losing momentum heading into the fourth quarter,\u201d said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cHowever, despite the slowing momentum, we still expect solid economic growth in Q4, just not quite at the same rate in Q3.\u201d\n\n&gt; The decline in manufacturers\u2019 new orders is likely in relation to election uncertainty, which should prove transitory. However, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in both Europe and the United States may cause business activity to slow, even if no additional lockdowns are mandated. As we head into the fourth quarter, we will continue to monitor real-time data for any additional clues about the pace of the economic recovery.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Halloween Trading Strategy: S&amp;P 500 Up 85% of the Time\n\n&gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 26 years. From the tables above &amp; below:\n\n&gt; * Dow up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.05%.\n&gt; * S&amp;P up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.11%.\n&gt; * NASDAQ up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.67%.\n&gt; * Russell 2000 up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.31%.\n\n&gt; Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course \u201cSell in May\u201d. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac that most of the market\u2019s gains have been made from October 31 to April 30, while the market tends to go sideways to down from May through October.\n\n&gt; Recent market weakness has held off our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal so far, but it could trigger anytime now. Uncertainty abounds with surging covid-19 cases, a heated presidential election and persistently elevated unemployment. However, each day that passes is one day closer to a covid-19 vaccine. Interest rates are low and ample liquidity is available to support the market and the economy. Additional fiscal stimulus also appears to be coming soon. Debate continues on the amount, but both parties do appear to agree it is needed in one form or another.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/79a067fc10d5ee40688ccec4ecb3fe2d/5899f7da34b8b8c0-e3/s500x750/4b0222300348a79e152bf80a85a41faf34984e3e.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/120a6a895b102be90ac05d6d5cbcdf2a/5899f7da34b8b8c0-26/s500x750/94df00168310f90a644b7aaa6f94820f807a4080.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/545ec0f231cb05daf30bc162745dc559/5899f7da34b8b8c0-25/s500x750/d84cab3903b5c92e70d470a07c469e2d646d38b8.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a59dd0402f777bcb3f8fd3fb014a35ed/5899f7da34b8b8c0-82/s500x750/f54029e610ed2abc990f8b7c6ea9678925bc0a5a.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # \"Quitters\"\n\n&gt; Like an old pair of \"quitters\" that keep falling down because their elasticity is shot, the market has had its own trouble staying up over the last few trading days. Today isn't over yet, but if the S&amp;P 500 finishes around current levels it will mark the fourth straight day of finishing down at least half of one percent from its intraday high. Compared to the three days before, today's pullback from an intraday high has actually been pretty mild up to this point. Following Monday's 2%+ decline from the intraday high shortly after the open, yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 traded down close to 1% from its afternoon high. These two reversals followed Friday's late-day sell-off when the S&amp;P 500 finished the day down 0.75% from its intraday high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Last-Four-Days1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it's disheartening to see the market erasing early gains as the day goes on, it's helpful to put the last four trading days into perspective. Over the last 25 years, it hasn't been uncommon for the S&amp;P 500 to finish the day down at least 0.5% from an intraday high for four days in a row. The current streak, if it holds, would be the 158th such streak of four or more days. That works out to more than six a year. There have also been a number of streaks that were much longer than the current one. In fact, it was only a month ago that the S&amp;P 500 went 11 straight days of finishing the day down at least 0.5% from its intraday high, and besides that streak, there have been five other streaks that spanned ten or more trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Streaks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # October Optimism For Homebuilders\n\n&gt; Given housing inventories remain historically low thanks to still strong demand, homebuilders have plenty to be optimistic about. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has continued to show this strength as its monthly sentiment survey set a record high for the month of October. Back in August, the index tied the previous record level of 78 from December of 1998. Over the past two months, it has only raised that bar, coming in at 85 this month; 2 points above forecasts and last month's reading of 83.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The rise in the index comes on broad strength across each of the sub-indices. Present Sales, Future Sales, and Traffic all matched or made record highs in October. The only sub-index that was not higher was for Traffic, though, it was unchanged at a record high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Table1.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the look across each of the four US regions, the West and Northeast both saw sizeable upticks to new records, but sentiment in the Midwest and South were actually slightly lower. For the Northeast, this is the third record in a row. Meanwhile, the West's record high in October finally surpassed the prior high of 91 from October of 2005. Finally, even though sentiment fell in the Midwest and South, both remain at higher levels now than any month other than September's record highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Regions.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 23rd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.25.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$TWLO** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$FSLY** \n&gt; * **$PINS** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$MRNA** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$ETSY** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$LGND** \n&gt; * **$FVRR** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$RTX** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$OSTK** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$ATVI** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$SHW** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$NVS** \n&gt; * **$NRZ** \n&gt; * **$MRK**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8wcVG2D.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.26.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AaPzlgn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9GgF3Hb.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rwj1IS3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/k4Rx5gI.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YjH86d9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LUzqajk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/NcPneVZ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/AMyjDf6.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/312QBRU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/mjgt9Gs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZJ4Y4Vk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3pFmMuz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SZg9uyc.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IGm07VC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IRNiQEm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SLRmoZE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.30.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7OhLjkG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Apple, Inc. $115.04\n**Apple, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 26th, 2020.\n\n# **There\u2019s a big week ahead for the market with an earnings deluge, GDP data and stimulus negotiations  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/theres-a-big-week-ahead-for-the-market-with-an-earnings-deluge-gdp-data-and-stimulus-negotiations.html)**\n*****\n&gt; About a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings, including Apple and Microsoft, but uncertainty around stimulus and the presidential election could loom larger for markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There is also important economic data on the calendar, with a first look at third-quarter gross domestic product Thursday. After the second quarter\u2019s shocking 31.4% decline following coronavirus shutdowns, the economy bounced back with growth of 32.5% expected in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly 170 companies report earnings in the coming week, with a diverse group of blue chips among them, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell, and Merck. There is also a big showing from large tech names. Microsoft reports Tuesday, and Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all report in a small window just after the market close on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFor some of these stocks that have run a long way, the bar for those stock to respond to good earnings is higher,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivative strategy at BTIG.\n*****\n&gt; So far about 85% of S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings beat estimates, about 20 percentage points more than the long term average. Companies have been reporting earnings more than 16% above estimates, and the expectation is that earnings overall will be down about 18%, based on actual results and forecasts, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.95% for the week, breaking a 3-week win streak as coronavirus fiscal negotiations dragged on and tech shares declined.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve offered compromises, the speaker on a number of issues is still dug in,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday. \u201cIf she wants to compromise, there will be a deal. But we\u2019ve made lots of progress in lots of areas, but there\u2019s still some significant areas that we\u2019re working through.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; His comments knocked stocks down a bit midday Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s been a muted reaction to earnings overall,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cSo I\u2019m disappointed, in a way, as a fundamentally focused chief investment officer, that the stimulus saga seems to be what it\u2019s all about day in and day out, hour by hour. It\u2019s the stimulus saga, the election looming and the Covid resurgence. Those three things have sort of made earnings a page four story.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; With a week to go before the Nov. 3 election, the market could be a bit more volatile, especially if the outcome looks increasingly less certain.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to focus on the state of stimulus. It\u2019s going to focus on whether the polls are tightening or widening with regard to the probability of having an unclear outcome, contested outcome or both,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s lead has narrowed slightly but he is still ahead in swing state polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe are experiencing a little bit of the calm before the storm here. I do think we are going to get some 1%, 2% daily moves depending on the news...I think you could see a 3% to 5% down opening the following day [after the election] pretty easily,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cI think the market has grown increasingly comfortable with a cleaner result, even if the cleaner result is an all blue result, which potentially would result in a higher tax regime.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market began to focus more on the possibility of a Democratic sweep, where Democrats take the White House and Congress. That could mean a bigger stimulus package, and some strategists believe tax hikes would be delayed until the economy is on more solid ground.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs we get closer to the election, we\u2019re likely to see more volatility no matter what the outcome,\u201d said Grohowski.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said investors are not adequately hedged for an uncertain outcome. \u201cActive managers have the most net long positions they\u2019ve had in a number of years because they\u2019re fearful of missing a year-end rally,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe options market in no way, shape or form is telling you people are hedged right here. The market is discounting a slight volatility, not expected to be persistent into year end.\u201d\n*****\nEmanuel said the options market indicates investors do expect some volatility but not through year end, as some investors began hedging for several months ago.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat we see by and large is again the bump in volatility. It\u2019s really only anticipating a 2% or 3% move in the market either way, after the election, and then the expectation is to likely moderate after that,\u201d Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; The final trading day of October is on Friday, so there could also be some added volatility as fund managers readjust their portfolios between bonds and stocks. In the past week, Treasury yields broke out of a four-month range. The 10-year yield rose above 0.80% for the first time since June, and while it could move higher, strategists expect its move to be contained.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/67jHHD1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/M13Rd10.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ROEcV0O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zqElHD7.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9iotJBk.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lrNGV86.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xGvBBYL.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tR0QKgZ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iXkAMua.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/80umQkP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4BQenwD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rZFBz4D.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq vs. Dow Outperformance\n\n&gt; You may not realize it, but while the Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up a ridiculous 28% so far in 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still in the red on the year.\n\n&gt; Below is a table showing the Dow and Nasdaq's annual percentage change since 1972 when the Nasdaq came into existence. Were the year to end now, the Nasdaq would be outperforming the Dow by 28.65 percentage points. This would be the third strongest outperformance for the Nasdaq on record and the strongest since 1999 when the spread was 60 percentage points!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/dowavg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/downazpctchg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/spreaduse.png))**\n\n&gt; Below are all years since 1972 in which the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by at least ten percentage points. The Nasdaq has posted an annual gain of 20%+ in seventeen different years, but never in a year when the Dow was in the red. Probably the year that most resembles 2020 in terms of the performance spread is 1979 when the Nasdaq rose 28.11% and the Dow rose just 4.19%. Following that year in 1980, both the Dow and Nasdaq surged again and the Nasdaq outperformed by another 18.9 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Interestingly, of the twelve years where the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by more than ten percentage points, the Nasdaq went on to beat the Dow again in the next year eleven out of twelve times. The only time we've seen the Nasdaq crumble versus the Dow in the following year was in 2000 after 1999's outperformance. In 1999, the Nasdaq beat the Dow by a humongous 60 percentage points. After that large gap, though, the Nasdaq ran out of gas in 2000 and underperformed the Dow by 33 percentage points when the Dot Com Bubble finally burst.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/outperfo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Show Slowing Pace of Economic Recovery\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) Beige Book presented qualitative data that suggested the pace of the economic recovery had been tapering, as we discussed in the LPL Research blog, Beige Book Shows Pace of Recovery is Moderating, but now we have quantitative data that is confirming the survey data. The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) increased 0.7% month over month in September to beat Bloomberg consensus expectations of 0.6%, but slowed after rising 1.4% in August and 2% in July.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the leading indicators are still growing, but at a slower rate than the blistering pace seen in the initial months after emerging from lockdowns.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.23.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Growth in the LEI in September was primarily driven by the improvement in jobless claims, as well as continued strength in building permits for new private housing\u2014a trend that matches the behavioral shifts to accommodate work from home conditions during the pandemic. The pullback in stock prices last month and manufacturers\u2019 new orders were the lone detractors from the LEI in September.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt comes as no surprise that growth began to level off after the surge over the summer, and the softer LEI print is suggesting the economy could be losing momentum heading into the fourth quarter,\u201d said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cHowever, despite the slowing momentum, we still expect solid economic growth in Q4, just not quite at the same rate in Q3.\u201d\n\n&gt; The decline in manufacturers\u2019 new orders is likely in relation to election uncertainty, which should prove transitory. However, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in both Europe and the United States may cause business activity to slow, even if no additional lockdowns are mandated. As we head into the fourth quarter, we will continue to monitor real-time data for any additional clues about the pace of the economic recovery.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Halloween Trading Strategy: S&amp;P 500 Up 85% of the Time\n\n&gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 26 years. From the tables above &amp; below:\n\n&gt; * Dow up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.05%.\n&gt; * S&amp;P up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.11%.\n&gt; * NASDAQ up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.67%.\n&gt; * Russell 2000 up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.31%.\n\n&gt; Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course \u201cSell in May\u201d. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac that most of the market\u2019s gains have been made from October 31 to April 30, while the market tends to go sideways to down from May through October.\n\n&gt; Recent market weakness has held off our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal so far, but it could trigger anytime now. Uncertainty abounds with surging covid-19 cases, a heated presidential election and persistently elevated unemployment. However, each day that passes is one day closer to a covid-19 vaccine. Interest rates are low and ample liquidity is available to support the market and the economy. Additional fiscal stimulus also appears to be coming soon. Debate continues on the amount, but both parties do appear to agree it is needed in one form or another.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/79a067fc10d5ee40688ccec4ecb3fe2d/5899f7da34b8b8c0-e3/s500x750/4b0222300348a79e152bf80a85a41faf34984e3e.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/120a6a895b102be90ac05d6d5cbcdf2a/5899f7da34b8b8c0-26/s500x750/94df00168310f90a644b7aaa6f94820f807a4080.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/545ec0f231cb05daf30bc162745dc559/5899f7da34b8b8c0-25/s500x750/d84cab3903b5c92e70d470a07c469e2d646d38b8.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a59dd0402f777bcb3f8fd3fb014a35ed/5899f7da34b8b8c0-82/s500x750/f54029e610ed2abc990f8b7c6ea9678925bc0a5a.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # \"Quitters\"\n\n&gt; Like an old pair of \"quitters\" that keep falling down because their elasticity is shot, the market has had its own trouble staying up over the last few trading days. Today isn't over yet, but if the S&amp;P 500 finishes around current levels it will mark the fourth straight day of finishing down at least half of one percent from its intraday high. Compared to the three days before, today's pullback from an intraday high has actually been pretty mild up to this point. Following Monday's 2%+ decline from the intraday high shortly after the open, yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 traded down close to 1% from its afternoon high. These two reversals followed Friday's late-day sell-off when the S&amp;P 500 finished the day down 0.75% from its intraday high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Last-Four-Days1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it's disheartening to see the market erasing early gains as the day goes on, it's helpful to put the last four trading days into perspective. Over the last 25 years, it hasn't been uncommon for the S&amp;P 500 to finish the day down at least 0.5% from an intraday high for four days in a row. The current streak, if it holds, would be the 158th such streak of four or more days. That works out to more than six a year. There have also been a number of streaks that were much longer than the current one. In fact, it was only a month ago that the S&amp;P 500 went 11 straight days of finishing the day down at least 0.5% from its intraday high, and besides that streak, there have been five other streaks that spanned ten or more trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Streaks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # October Optimism For Homebuilders\n\n&gt; Given housing inventories remain historically low thanks to still strong demand, homebuilders have plenty to be optimistic about. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has continued to show this strength as its monthly sentiment survey set a record high for the month of October. Back in August, the index tied the previous record level of 78 from December of 1998. Over the past two months, it has only raised that bar, coming in at 85 this month; 2 points above forecasts and last month's reading of 83.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The rise in the index comes on broad strength across each of the sub-indices. Present Sales, Future Sales, and Traffic all matched or made record highs in October.

However, also noted that big differences remain. While White House increased its offer to nearly $1.9T, Pelosi is sticking to a $2.2-2.4T range. Pelosi also noted earlier that the two sides have not bridged their differences on issues such as state and local government funding and liability protections. These are the same issues that have weighed on stimulus talks for months. Even if the two sides are able to reach a deal, there is significant resistance to a large stimulus package among Senate Republicans.

Trial has been on hold in the US since early September after a participant in the company's UK trial became ill with what was suspected to be transverse myelitis. However, it has resumed elsewhere, including the UK. Follows comments from Moderna (MRNA-US) CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel, who said the FDA could grant emergency use authorization to the company's coronavirus vaccine in December if it gets positive interim results in November from a large clinical trial. Despite some recent trial pauses, vaccine optimism has remained elevated. Pfizer (PFE-US) reiterated last week that it may know if its coronavirus vaccine is effective by the end of the month and could file for emergency use authorization by late November.\n\n**September housing starts missed on multifamily weakness while building permits beat:**\n\n* September **housing starts** came in at 1.415M SAAR, below consensus for 1.457M and August's 1.388M downwardly revised pace (was 1.416M). Up 1.9% m/m and up 11.1% y/y. Single-family starts up 8.5% m/m. Northeast and South stronger and Midwest weaker. Multifamily starts fell 14.7% m/m. September **building permits** at 1.553M SAAR above consensus for 1.515M and August's revised 1.476M level (previously 1.470M). Up 5.2% m/m and 8.1% y/y. Strength was similarly concentrated in single family permits. Comes after a record **NAHB housing market index** for October released yesterday. Coming up are Sep **existing home sales** (cons 6.25M, prior 6M) on Thursday, Sep **new home sales** (cons 1M, 1.011M prior) on Monday, Sep **pending home sales** (cons and prior 132.8K) next Thursday.\n\n**Earnings activity picks up:**\n\n* Following the latest batch of Q3 results, just over 13% of the S&amp;P 500 has now reported Q3 results. According to FactSet, 88% of reporters have surpassed consensus EPS expectations, well above the 73% one- and five-year averages. In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings more than 18% above expectations, much better than the 8% and 5.6% one- and five-year average positive surprise rates. Following the record beat rate for Q2 earnings and positive revision trends during Q3, there has been some focus on a higher bar. Companies leveraged to at-home trends continue to report some of the strongest results. The Street remains upbeat on margin expansion/protection given the softer macro backdrop. Guidance raises have also been fairly well received amid lingering Q4 uncertainty. Capital return announcements have been another bright spot.\n\n**All sectors higher, with energy, financials the leaders:**\n\n* **Energy** led the market, with E&amp;Ps and oil-services names rallying. **Financials** outperformed on strength from banks (particularly regionals) after latest batch of earnings. **Communication services** was boosted by the megacap internets (a bit of drag from telecom space). **Consumer discretionary** beat the tape with help from autos/suppliers, multiline retailers, and hotels/leisure. Transports, building product helped **industrials**, but A&amp;D was mixed (LMT-US ). **Tech** sector was mixed.

Added that Biden has a modest or wide lead over Trump on all of the most pressing issues at stake in the election, except the economy, where voters are now evenly split after long favoring Trump. While Biden has long held a solid lead over Trump in the national polls, the battleground polls have been tighter and fit with thoughts that the race is by no means over. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-battlegrounds-poll/trump-appears-to-cut-into-bidens-lead-in-pennsylvania-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN2742P9) noted that the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Biden's lead in Pennsylvania fall to 4 points from 7 points last week. In addition, Biden's lead in Florida halved to 2 points. However, Biden saw his lead over Trump expand in Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina, and remain unchanged at 8 points in Michigan.\n\n**DoJ set to file suit against Alphabet over Google antitrust:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-to-file-long-awaited-antitrust-suit-against-google-11603195203) reported Justice Department to file an antitrust suit today against Alphabet (GOOGL-US), alleging that Google engaged in anticompetitive conduct to preserve monopolies in search and search-advertising. Comes amid broader regulatory scrutiny on tech giants, with nearly all state attorneys general separately investigating Google, and House antitrust subcommittee releasing report that Google, Facebook (FB-US), Apple (AAPL-US), and Amazon (AMZN-US) all wield monopoly power ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-panel-calls-for-congress-to-break-up-tech-giants-11602016985?mod=hp_lead_pos3)). Despite increased antitrust threat, there has been minimal market impact. Analysts have noted investigations likely to result in fines or tweaks to business models rather than full breakups with little bipartisan agreement on how to handle antitrust issues, while market still focused on leveraged to structural growth theme.\n\n**Energy M&amp;A picking up, but low-premium deals highlight industry struggles:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/business/energy-environment/conocophillips-concho-oil-merger.html) and [Bloomberg](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/business/energy-environment/conocophillips-concho-oil-merger.html) discussed the pickup in M&amp;A activity in the energy sector. Noted that with companies having already cut back drilling, laid off workers and written off assets, they are increasingly focused on M&amp;A to reduce costs. These trends have been driven by the demand headwinds from the pandemic. Industry has also faced pressure from years of elevated debt loads, lackluster shareholder returns, value-destroying deals, and climate change concerns. All of these dynamics have weighed on takeover prices as more than half of the shale deals this year came with a premium of less than 10% over already depressed stock prices. Following Cononco's $9.7B acquisition of Concho Resources on Monday, [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pioneer-natural-resources-is-in-talks-to-buy-parsley-energy-11603153466?mod=hp_lista_pos2) reported Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD-US) is in talks to acquire Parsley Energy (PE-US).\n\n**Democrats will go big on spending in the event of a November sweep:**\n\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/19/democrats-budget-plans-november-win-430169) and [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/upshot/biden-stimulus.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage) discussed how a Democratic sweep in November could unleash a big wave of government spending. The former noted that Democrats are already eyeing a special legislative vehicle known as reconciliation to disperse trillions of dollars in policy priorities, including infrastructure, clean energy, child care and more. The latter discussed how cognizant of failures of Obama-era stimulus, Biden and Democrats will look to go big on coronavirus relief measures. It pointed out that the package would likely be similar to the $3T+ measure House Democrats passed in the spring. This compares to the estimated \\~$600B of pandemic-related stimulus that would follow a Trump victory and Republican retention of Senate control. Both articles also fit with calls for a greater focus on the Senate races than the presidential contest.\n\n**Some high-frequency indicators suggest US economic rebound losing momentum:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/recovery-tracker/?sref=L75TRUmI) said that a number of indicators on its weekly dashboard of high-frequency, alternative and market-based data suggest the US economic rebound is losing momentum. These include jobless claims and restaurant bookings. Flagged waning stimulus, rising coronavirus cases and cooler weather as headwinds. Also discussed continued softness in public transportation and air travel. However, it did point out that a weekly measure of retail sales has continued to advance and housing remains a recovery bright spot. Morgan Stanley has said that even without stimulus, there is enough momentum in the recovery to keep the US economy on pace to return to pre-Covid levels of real GDP by the middle of next year.

Added that Biden has a modest or wide lead over Trump on all of the most pressing issues at stake in the election, except the economy, where voters are now evenly split after long favoring Trump. While Biden has long held a solid lead over Trump in the national polls, the battleground polls have been tighter and fit with thoughts that the race is by no means over. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-battlegrounds-poll/trump-appears-to-cut-into-bidens-lead-in-pennsylvania-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN2742P9) noted that the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Biden's lead in Pennsylvania fall to 4 points from 7 points last week. In addition, Biden's lead in Florida halved to 2 points. However, Biden saw his lead over Trump expand in Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina, and remain unchanged at 8 points in Michigan.\n\n**DoJ set to file suit against Alphabet over Google antitrust:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-to-file-long-awaited-antitrust-suit-against-google-11603195203) reported Justice Department to file an antitrust suit today against Alphabet (GOOGL-US), alleging that Google engaged in anticompetitive conduct to preserve monopolies in search and search-advertising. Comes amid broader regulatory scrutiny on tech giants, with nearly all state attorneys general separately investigating Google, and House antitrust subcommittee releasing report that Google, Facebook (FB-US), Apple (AAPL-US), and Amazon (AMZN-US) all wield monopoly power ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-panel-calls-for-congress-to-break-up-tech-giants-11602016985?mod=hp_lead_pos3)). Despite increased antitrust threat, there has been minimal market impact. Analysts have noted investigations likely to result in fines or tweaks to business models rather than full breakups with little bipartisan agreement on how to handle antitrust issues, while market still focused on leveraged to structural growth theme.\n\n**Energy M&amp;A picking up, but low-premium deals highlight industry struggles:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/business/energy-environment/conocophillips-concho-oil-merger.html) and [Bloomberg](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/business/energy-environment/conocophillips-concho-oil-merger.html) discussed the pickup in M&amp;A activity in the energy sector. Noted that with companies having already cut back drilling, laid off workers and written off assets, they are increasingly focused on M&amp;A to reduce costs. These trends have been driven by the demand headwinds from the pandemic. Industry has also faced pressure from years of elevated debt loads, lackluster shareholder returns, value-destroying deals, and climate change concerns. All of these dynamics have weighed on takeover prices as more than half of the shale deals this year came with a premium of less than 10% over already depressed stock prices. Following Cononco's $9.7B acquisition of Concho Resources on Monday, [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pioneer-natural-resources-is-in-talks-to-buy-parsley-energy-11603153466?mod=hp_lista_pos2) reported Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD-US) is in talks to acquire Parsley Energy (PE-US).\n\n**Democrats will go big on spending in the event of a November sweep:**\n\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/19/democrats-budget-plans-november-win-430169) and [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/upshot/biden-stimulus.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage) discussed how a Democratic sweep in November could unleash a big wave of government spending. The former noted that Democrats are already eyeing a special legislative vehicle known as reconciliation to disperse trillions of dollars in policy priorities, including infrastructure, clean energy, child care and more. The latter discussed how cognizant of failures of Obama-era stimulus, Biden and Democrats will look to go big on coronavirus relief measures. It pointed out that the package would likely be similar to the $3T+ measure House Democrats passed in the spring. This compares to the estimated \\~$600B of pandemic-related stimulus that would follow a Trump victory and Republican retention of Senate control. Both articles also fit with calls for a greater focus on the Senate races than the presidential contest.\n\n**Some high-frequency indicators suggest US economic rebound losing momentum:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/recovery-tracker/?sref=L75TRUmI) said that a number of indicators on its weekly dashboard of high-frequency, alternative and market-based data suggest the US economic rebound is losing momentum. These include jobless claims and restaurant bookings. Flagged waning stimulus, rising coronavirus cases and cooler weather as headwinds. Also discussed continued softness in public transportation and air travel. However, it did point out that a weekly measure of retail sales has continued to advance and housing remains a recovery bright spot. Morgan Stanley has said that even without stimulus, there is enough momentum in the recovery to keep the US economy on pace to return to pre-Covid levels of real GDP by the middle of next year.

He keeps Outperform ratings on Facebook and Snap, and Market Perform ratings on Pinterest and Twitter.\n\nBut the story Shmulik likes best is Google. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for upside potential, it\u2019s hard to look past Google,\u201d he writes in a research note. \u201cThe mid cap stocks (Twitter, Snap, Pinterest) have had quite the run these past few months and the embedded expectations are sky high. Facebook should do just fine, but again the expectations appear embedded in the price.\n\n\u201cThat leaves Google, the \u2018Internet stock left behind\u2019 during the recovery off the bottom.

[tweeted](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1313551794623127552) he has rejected House Speaker Pelosi's $2.4T proposal for a fifth round of coronavirus stimulus, suggesting much of the amount would be used to bail out Democratic-run states. Said he will stop negotiating until after the election, expecting that he will pass a major stimulus bill after he is reelected. Added Senate Majority Leader McConnell should focus on upcoming confirmation hearings for his SCOTUS nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. Abrupt end to stimulus talks comes after a weeks-long back and forth between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin that did not seem to be closing the gap between Democrats' offer and the White House's $1.6T. Pelosi criticized Trump's move, saying it shows the White House is in complete disarray. However, still a lot of focus on whether more stimulus could come in January in the event Democrats win the White House and control in the Senate.\n\n**Most sectors lower with big tech, energy the big underperformers:**\n\n* Pullback in FAANG names after a strong session Monday was a weight on **consumer discretionary**, **communication services**, and **tech**. Entertainment, homebuilders, retail/apparel were some of the other drags in these sectors. **Energy** another underperformer despite another big day for crude (WTI up almost 10% this week). **Healthcare** just beat the tape, helped by a smattering of gainers among MedTech. **Materials** was largely down, but sector had some support from select chemical firms. Airlines were a weight on **industrials**, but machinery was mixed. **Financials** saw credit cards down but regional banks were not so bad overall. **Consumer staples** saw some help from HPCs. **Utilities** was the only sector in the green.\n\n**Trump says will hit campaign trail soon, will participate in next week's debate:**\n\n* President Trump said today he would be back on the campaign trail soon, while his campaign said that he intends to be ready to participate in the second presidential debate scheduled for Thursday, 15-Oct in Miami ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/trump-looking-forward-to-second-debate-with-biden-after-covid-diagnosis.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain)). [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-06/trump-is-considering-televised-speech-after-return-from-hospital?srnd=premium) reported Trump wants to return to the Oval Office today, and while some aides don't want the president to leave the residence, they're unsure how long he'll continue to isolate himself. Elsewhere, General Milley, top US military official, among members of Joint Chiefs of Staff in self-quarantine after Coast Guard's vice commandant tested positive ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-06/military-s-chief-to-quarantine-after-an-admiral-tests-positive?srnd=premium&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B)). Comes after President Trump was discharged from Walter Reed Medical Center on Monday evening and returned to the White House, tweeted a video in which he said he was feeling better and urged Americans not to be afraid of the coronavirus. Trump's physician today said the president reported no symptoms after first night back at White House.\n\n**Powell cautiously optimistic, again makes case for further support:**\n\n* No big surprises from Fed Chair Powell's [keynote speech](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20201006a.htm) at the NABE annual conference today. Noted combination of fiscal and monetary actions have for now muted recessionary dynamics, but cautioned outlook remains highly uncertain due to the coronavirus. Warned about risk rapid reopening gains could transition to a longer-than-expected slog back, noting in particular increase in permanent job losses. Suggested risks of policy intervention are asymmetric, with too little leading to unnecessary hardship while relief that proves greater than needed will still not go to waste. His comments on monetary policy and forward guidance were tightly in line with recent Fed pronouncements and broke no new ground.\n\n**Biden 16 points ahead of Trump in new national poll:**\n\n* [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/politics/cnn-poll-biden-trump-2020-election/index.html) said that a new nationwide CNN Poll conducted by SSRS showed that Joe Biden's advantage over President Trump has widened to 16 points, his largest of the cycle. The prior survey at the beginning of September showed Biden with an 8-point lead. Report noted that similar to a recently released WSJ-NBC News poll, the CNN poll suggests Biden likely received a bump from the first presidential debate. However, it also pointed out that the poll does not show any meaningful pullback in support for Trump. It said Trump's core backers remain as supportive of him as they have been, if not more. It also stressed that the election will ultimately come down to a handful of swing stakes, where Biden has a narrower lead. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-battlegrounds-poll/reuters-ipsos-poll-shows-biden-leading-in-pennsylvania-wisconsin-idUSKBN26Q2ZT) said Reuters/Ipsos polls out on Monday showed Biden 5 points ahead of Trump in Pennsylvania and 6 points ahead in Wisconsin, while today's [Monmouth](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_pa_100620.pdf/) poll showed Biden holding a 12-point lead across registered voters in Pennsylvania.\n\n**White House agrees to FDA guidance for two-month vaccine followup:**\n\n* The US FDA today released expected [guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download) saying that data from phase 3 studies for coronavirus vaccine candidates should include two months of follow-up data in order to qualify for emergency use authorization (EUA), meaning it is most likely a vaccine will not be cleared for use until after the 3-Nov presidential election. Recall that the Trump administration had voiced objections to the FDA's likely guidance, with Trump himself saying the FDA needed to move quickly and hinting he \"may or may not\" approve such guidance, saying it seemed like a political move. However, the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-agrees-to-fdas-guidelines-for-vetting-covid-19-vaccines-11602011953) reported today that the White House has endorsed the guidelines. For its part, the FDA said it hoped the guidance will help the public understand that its practices help ensure quality, safety, and efficacy for any vaccine it authorizes.\n\n**Democrats on House panel to recommend measures that could make it easier to break up big tech platforms:**\n\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/05/gop-democrats-tech-antitrust-proposals-426528) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-05/house-panel-to-recommend-breakup-of-tech-giants-republican-says?srnd=premium&amp;sref=L75TRUmI) reported that Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee are poised to propose sweeping reforms that could make it easier to break up big tech platforms. However, these proposals have already been previewed by Representative David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat leading the investigation. He said back in August that his panel's inquiry confirmed Google (GOOGL-US ), Apple (AAPL-US ), Amazon (AMZN-US ) and Facebook (FB-US ) are abusing their market power to crush competitors and Congress needs to respond. Republican Representative Ken Buck of Colorado said that while he agrees with Cicilline on the need to rein in the power of big tech and provide more resources for antitrust enforcers, the more aggressive proposals like legislation creating structural separation are \"non-starters\" for Republicans. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/scoop-house-dems-briefing-biden-team-on-tech-antitrust-report-843b1d7d-fbc1-43b4-b425-96bcc872bd93.html) also reported House Judiciary Democrats to brief Biden's team today.\n\n**Central banks focused on need for fiscal stimulus but face decisions on QE:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-cenbanks/mid-recovery-coronavirus-spreading-global-central-bankers-take-stock-idUSKBN26R0JS) discussed how leading central bankers are expected to continue to stress the need for additional fiscal policy support to cushion the global economy from the coronavirus pandemic. However, it also pointed out that the Fed, ECB and BOJ all face decisions in the coming weeks over their next crisis-fighting measures, particularly when it comes to the question of whether and how to expand the amounts and types of assets they are buying each month. One of the disappointments coming out of the September FOMC meeting was that while the Fed tweaked the QE rationale to include helping to foster accommodative financial conditions, it did not adjust the size or composition of the asset purchase program. The Fed's Mester said on Monday she does not see a current need for more bond buying (Fed's Evans was also cautious last week) but wants the option to extend duration.", false, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 868043, "public", "self", "Top Stories - Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2020", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j6chyx/top_stories_tuesday_oct_6_2020/", "all_ads", 6, 1602011270.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "spacej3di", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_kdm2ull", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1602014870, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j6chyx/top_stories_tuesday_oct_6_2020/", "gildings": {}, "id": "j6chyx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "resources", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "a376614c-65e6-11e5-b6e7-123c7cc7e97b", "link_flair_text": "Resources", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/j6chyx/top_stories_tuesday_oct_6_2020/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Ptp7NpWYrlVad3rOJ1SZRbeyyLhs1-ReJ7rOaKgyQrs", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kNn-VUL_WDT2fli5KjAY1_sfQ9UUFDD-62N_yt6iQ-4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c031fb0494affe012dc3651121742690d35a49ab", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kNn-VUL_WDT2fli5KjAY1_sfQ9UUFDD-62N_yt6iQ-4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e7d9e9531981df6a1bbee0deff47372d0633251", "width": 216}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kNn-VUL_WDT2fli5KjAY1_sfQ9UUFDD-62N_yt6iQ-4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=127b51ab3933b005daa4bf19ca1b5099f828bfd1", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 400, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kNn-VUL_WDT2fli5KjAY1_sfQ9UUFDD-62N_yt6iQ-4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d6d70346b02c13e65b977992ffa9f82e4af5d161", "width": 400}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1602014880, "score": 1, "selftext": "Summarized to save you time.\n\n**Trump says he is done negotiating with Democrats over stimulus:**\n\n* President Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1313551794623127552) he has rejected House Speaker Pelosi's $2.4T proposal for a fifth round of coronavirus stimulus, suggesting much of the amount would be used to bail out Democratic-run states.

GM also mentioned that sales improved sequentially each month within Q3 and that both industry and GM sales rebounded significantly in October, finishing the month with y/y sales increases. The articles highlighted strong consumer demand for SUVs, trucks and hybrids. These groups were longstanding outperformers before the coronavirus pandemic as well. Demand underpinned by a combination of broader economic recovery and low rates. A number of other companies with leverage to autos have also highlighted the sector recovery in their recent updates. These include dealers, semis and electronics.\n\n**Fed extends dividend and buyback restrictions on banks:**\n\n* Fed [announced ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200930b.htm)Wednesday after the close that none of the 33 banks with more than $100B of assets would be allowed to resume share repurchases in Q4 and that it would also maintain a cap on dividend payments. Fed said move intended to ensure the banks maintain a high level of capital resilience. Added that the capital positions of the big banks have remained strong during Q3 while such restrictions were in place. Move was widely expected by the Street. A number of banks that presented at the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference last month expressed an interest in resuming buyback activity as soon as possible. Capital return uncertainty has been an overhang on the group. The other big headwind has been lower NII guidance from softer loan demand and an uptick in repayments. However, banks have been more upbeat on asset quality.\n\n**Senate panel votes to subpoena tech executives:**\n\n* [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/519101-senate-panel-votes-to-subpoena-big-tech-executives) noted that the Senate Commerce Committee voted Thursday to subpoena the CEOs of Twitter (TWTR-US ), Google (GOOGL-US ) and Facebook (FB-US ). The vote compels the CEOs to testify at a hearing on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that will discuss social media's alleged conservative bias. The move was previewed last week. DOJ has already recommended that Congress pare back Section 230 laws, which give sites broad immunity from lawsuits for words, images, and videos. Back in May, President Trump signed an executive order to limit protections for online platforms. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/congress-looks-to-squeeze-big-tech-ahead-of-election-8deb407a-8e2a-4989-9682-dade915583a8.html) recently discussed how it's nearly certain that neither a Section 230 reform bill from the Senate nor the antitrust legislation that could come out of the House will pass anytime soon. Market has also tended to ignore the continued pickup in regulatory scrutiny in favor of secular growth and disruption themes.\n\n**Mixed vaccine headlines:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-30/oxford-astra-covid-vaccine-review-said-to-start-in-europe?srnd=premium-asia&amp;sref=L75TRUmI) reported European regulators set to announce an accelerated review of the coronavirus candidate from AstraZeneca (AZN-US ) and the University of Oxford. This will allow them to see trial data while the study is ongoing and potentially speed up the approval process. However, [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-vaccine-astrazenec/exclusive-fda-widens-u-s-safety-inquiry-into-astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-sources-idUKKBN26L3T8) reported the FDA has broadened its investigation of a serious illness in the AstraZeneca trial and will look at data from earlier trials developed by the same scientists. Noted this raises likelihood of further delays for what has been one of the most advanced vaccine candidates. CEO of Moderna (MRNA-US ) told the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/9b242ecc-3dce-4534-9171-cdf624468a2a) that his company would not be able to apply to the FDA for emergency use authorization of its coronavirus vaccine until at least late November.

This is up from an original proposal of $1T though Mnuchin has previously expressed a willingness to go up to $1.5T. The new offer includes $250B in funding for state and local governments, up from $100B, but below the nearly $400B+ sought by Democrats in their latest proposal. It also features $400 a week of additional unemployment benefits, up from their prior $300 a week offer but still below the $600 sought by Democrats.

New orders index down 7.4 at 60.2, production index down 2.3 at 61, employment index up 3.2 at 49.6, new export orders index up 1 at 54.3. The report indicated expansion in the economy for the fifth month since contraction in April with manufacturers becoming better at maintaining output in reconfigured factories. Elsewhere, September **IHS Markit final manufacturing PMI** of 53.2 slightly lower than flash 53.5 and above 53.1 in August.

Recent layoff announcements have come from Disney (DIS-US ), Goldman Sachs (GS-US ), Allstate (ALL-US ), Marathon Petroleum (MPC-US ), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS-GB ), Elanco (ELAN-US ), and the airlines. The article highlighted concerns that job losses have begun to spill over the from the service sector that initially suffered the brunt of the layoffs from the coronavirus pandemic with more companies now looking to protect margins. Cost-cutting has been a key component of the earnings resilience theme.

In a research note Thursday, Nowak repeats his Overweight rating on the search giant's shares (ticker: GOOGL), lifting his price target on the stock to $1,800 from $1,760. His primary thesis is that Google is the first place consumers turn when they are researching purchases and comparing prices on almost anything -- and the company's ad revenue should benefit from a holiday season in which many consumers will likely shop from home.\n\nA new Morgan Stanley survey finds that 50% of Americans use Google when researching products, with 33% using the search engine to compare prices.

In a research note Thursday, Nowak repeats his Overweight rating on the search giant's shares (ticker: GOOGL), lifting his price target on the stock to $1,800 from $1,760. His primary thesis is that Google is the first place consumers turn when they are researching purchases and comparing prices on almost anything -- and the company's ad revenue should benefit from a holiday season in which many consumers will likely shop from home.\n\nA new Morgan Stanley survey finds that 50% of Americans use Google when researching products, with 33% using the search engine to compare prices.

Pointed out that 27 states and Puerto Rico have shown an increase in the seven-day average of new confirmed cases since the final week of August. Also discussed how countries that had been successful early on in dampening viral transmission are now struggling with new waves of cases and instituting new lockdowns. While the resurgence in Europe has been flagged as one of several overhangs on stocks over the last few weeks, the market has long tended to overlook rising case counts in favor of better treatment methods, an unwillingness to revert to the more draconian mitigation measures and most importantly, expectations of a near-term vaccine breakthrough.\n\n**Biden could end up being tougher on China than Trump:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/world/asia/biden-china-election-trump.html) noted that according to analysts in China, Joe Biden could end up being tougher on China than President Trump if he wins in November.

In addition, unlike Trump, Biden expected to pursue a multilateral approach with America's allies to push back against China's global ambitions.

Analysts also discussed the very elevated expectations surrounding the event, execution and operational challenges, investment requirements and premium valuation.\n\n**Health experts worried about an autumn surge in coronavirus cases:**\n\n* [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-states-cases-increase/2020/09/22/105826b4-f9ef-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html) said progress in slowing the coronavirus has stalled in much of the US, exacerbating concerns about a surge in cases as colder weather settles across the nation. Pointed out that 27 states and Puerto Rico have shown an increase in the seven-day average of new confirmed cases since the final week of August. Also discussed how countries that had been successful early on in dampening viral transmission are now struggling with new waves of cases and instituting new lockdowns. While the resurgence in Europe has been flagged as one of several overhangs on stocks over the last few weeks, the market has long tended to overlook rising case counts in favor of better treatment methods, an unwillingness to revert to the more draconian mitigation measures and most importantly, expectations of a near-term vaccine breakthrough.\n\n**Biden could end up being tougher on China than Trump:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/world/asia/biden-china-election-trump.html) noted that according to analysts in China, Joe Biden could end up being tougher on China than President Trump if he wins in November. Noted Biden has already promised to take a harder line on climate change and China's crackdowns on ethnic minorities and Hong Kong. In addition, unlike Trump, Biden expected to pursue a multilateral approach with America's allies to push back against China's global ambitions. However, article pointed out that many Chinese officials have come around to the view that China will likely face a harsher political environment in the US, regardless of who wins in November. Biden has already said he would not keep tariffs on China ([NPR](https://twitter.com/lourdesgnavarro/status/1291001056630112262)) and some Wall Street strategists have suggested that a less hawkish approach on trade could offset some of the market concerns surrounding his push for higher corporate taxes.\n\n01:08:07 PM CDT on 23 Sep '20", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 856747, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Top Stories - Wednesday, Sept. 23, 2020", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iyfnqh/top_stories_wednesday_sept_23_2020/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1600881401.0}], [[], false, "7thAccountDontDelete", null, [], null, "text", "t2_wf4by", false, false, [], false, false, 1600759474, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ixisw9/unh_unitedhealth_group_inc/", {}, "ixisw9", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "tickerdiscussion", [], "612ee368-65e6-11e5-b53f-129e4297eb59", "Ticker Discussion", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 1, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/ixisw9/unh_unitedhealth_group_inc/", false, 6, 1600759485, 1, "UnitedHealth Group Incorporated is the largest healthcare services provider in the world.

[WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-pushes-for-u-s-control-of-tiktok-11600295711?mod=hp_lead_pos2) also reported Trump administration officials have sought to ensure US investors hold significant majority stake in the company that will take over TikTok, headlined by Oracle (ORCL-US ) and Walmart (WMT-US ).\n\n**Fed survey shows improvement to households' financial strain from government support:**\n\n* The Fed's [update](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2019-report-economic-well-being-us-households-update-202009.pdf) to its Report on the Economic Well-Being of US Households survey, which was conducted in July, said that employment outcomes differed markedly across workers of different incomes and education levels. It also said that the extraordinary governmental measures in response to the pandemic helped ease families' financial strain, with financial well-being higher in the July survey than early April before the financial relief efforts were in place. The report was in line with recent Fed commentary on the need for more fiscal policy stimulus. Fed Chair Powell said in the post-FOMC press conference this week that while fiscal support has been essential to the recent recovery, more fiscal support is likely to be needed given the 11M people still out of work due to the pandemic, struggling small businesses, and declining revenues across state and local governments.\n\n**Companies see higher taxes post-election, no matter who wins:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-brace-for-higher-taxes-after-u-s-election-11600366918) reported that financial executives at major US companies expect corporate tax rates to rise following the November election, no matter who wins, according to PwC survey. Former VP Biden said he supports raising corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, add new surtax to companies that make products overseas and sell them back to US and raise minimum tax on foreign income. Trump hasn't proposed any changes, but the article noted that executives anticipate higher taxes on expectation government will have to fund stimulus spending, tax deferrals, and other federal COVID-related relief. Also said if Trump is re-elected, executives will likely spend more on companies' supply chains to protect against fallout of US-China tensions.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 850881, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Top Stories - Friday, Sept. 18, 2020", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iva9px/top_stories_friday_sept_18_2020/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1600445744.0}], [[], false, "perplexedkawa", null, [], null, "text", "t2_7rtlvp58", false, false, [], false, false, 1600377598, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iusoks/23yo_just_started_investing_and_id_like_to_get/", {}, "iusoks", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 4, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/iusoks/23yo_just_started_investing_and_id_like_to_get/", false, 6, 1600377609, 1, "2k parked in VFFVX\n\n3k in MGK \n\n22 shares of AAPL\n\n30 shares of AMD\n\n2 shares of GOOGL\n\n2 shares of AMZN \n\nI know I\u2019m not diversified to a great degree, but is this a good spread to start out with?

Meanwhile, Facebook was down nearly 4%, Amazon and Microsoft over 4%, and Apple over 5%. And on Tuesday, workplace collaboration app Slack ([WORK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WORK/)) saw its stock plummet over 15% in after-hours trading [following a disappointing earnings report](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/slack-second-quarter-earnings-work-from-home-202052097.html).\n\nThat\u2019s led to rumblings that the market \u2014 which has been bounced around by these and other massive tech names \u2014 is careening toward a second coming of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s that came crashing down 20 years ago. That era was best epitomized by Pets.com, which, despite a flashy advertising campaign, flamed out just 9 months after its initial public offering.\n\n But according to Capital Economics\u2019 senior markets economist Oliver Jones, the rapid growth in tech stocks is different from the dot-com bubble for two reasons \u2014 most big-name tech stocks are fundamentally sound companies, and, despite recent volatility, tech stocks have provided a safe haven as other industries have faltered amid the pandemic.\n\n## Tech firms are delivering on fundamentals\n\n[As Jones writes in a research note](https://www.capitaleconomics.com/clients/publications/capital-daily/capital-daily-publication/what-options-can-tell-us-about-the-latest-swings-in-stock-markets/?tk=c63709907946e8cbf7b30754fbfa76d993088517), one of the key differences between the dot-com bubble and the current Big Tech market leaders is that, unlike many of those first-generation websites that took off, firms like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft have solid fundamentals.\n\n\u201cWhile options market shenanigans may have contributed a bit lately, the main catalyst for their rally is simply the fact that their businesses have done extremely well, in both absolute and relative terms, during the coronavirus crisis. That has not changed in the past week,\u201d Jones wrote in note.\n\nThe tech firms aren\u2019t just making money \u2014 they\u2019re doing so on a sustained basis and cruising past their prior year earnings even amid a global pandemic crippling other parts of the economy.\n\n\u201cBears will start to make comparisons to the \\[dot-com bubble\\] of the late nineties,\u201d David Nelson, chief strategist of Belpointe Asset Management, wrote in a note Tuesday. \u201cAs a veteran of that war I can tell you there's little resemblance. While valuations are stretched most of the big cap secular growth stocks are profitable. That was not the case in 2000.\u201d\n\n Take Apple. [In the second quarter of 2020](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-q2-earnings-2020-203115363.html), the pandemic shuttered production facilities in China and then forced it to close stores around the world outside of Mainland China. The company still managed to increase revenue year-over-year by 1% to $58.3 billion. [In Q3 2020](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-q3-earnings-2020-203224360.html), the company saw revenue grow 11% year-over-year to $59.7 billion.\n\nAmazon and Microsoft, meanwhile, have already been on a roll thanks to the performance of their cloud platforms as the pandemic spurs demand for such services. Amazon, of course, has also benefited immensely thanks to its positioning as a lifeline for essential goods when many people were stuck in their homes in the early portion of the pandemic.\n\nGoogle\u2019s parent Alphabet was the outlier, with revenue decreasing year-over-year [in Q2 2020](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-googl-q2-earnings-revenues-214509856.html) by 2%, partly due to a pullback in ad sales.\n\n## The tech industry has been a bright spot despite recent volatility\n\nThose performance metrics come as entire swaths of the economy have been decimated by the coronavirus pandemic including the hotel business and airlines. STR, [a data analytics firm for the hospitality industry](https://str.com/press-release/str-us-hotel-results-week-ending-29-august), found the U.S. hotel occupancy was down 27% year-over-year for the week ending Aug. 29. What\u2019s more, revenue per room was off 44.5%.\n\nThe airline industry has laid off thousands, as consumers either avoid airports entirely or are unable to travel internationally.

Meanwhile, Facebook was down nearly 4%, Amazon and Microsoft over 4%, and Apple over 5%. And on Tuesday, workplace collaboration app Slack ([WORK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WORK/)) saw its stock plummet over 15% in after-hours trading [following a disappointing earnings report](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/slack-second-quarter-earnings-work-from-home-202052097.html).\n\nThat\u2019s led to rumblings that the market \u2014 which has been bounced around by these and other massive tech names \u2014 is careening toward a second coming of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s that came crashing down 20 years ago. That era was best epitomized by Pets.com, which, despite a flashy advertising campaign, flamed out just 9 months after its initial public offering.\n\n But according to Capital Economics\u2019 senior markets economist Oliver Jones, the rapid growth in tech stocks is different from the dot-com bubble for two reasons \u2014 most big-name tech stocks are fundamentally sound companies, and, despite recent volatility, tech stocks have provided a safe haven as other industries have faltered amid the pandemic.\n\n## Tech firms are delivering on fundamentals\n\n[As Jones writes in a research note](https://www.capitaleconomics.com/clients/publications/capital-daily/capital-daily-publication/what-options-can-tell-us-about-the-latest-swings-in-stock-markets/?tk=c63709907946e8cbf7b30754fbfa76d993088517), one of the key differences between the dot-com bubble and the current Big Tech market leaders is that, unlike many of those first-generation websites that took off, firms like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft have solid fundamentals.\n\n\u201cWhile options market shenanigans may have contributed a bit lately, the main catalyst for their rally is simply the fact that their businesses have done extremely well, in both absolute and relative terms, during the coronavirus crisis. That has not changed in the past week,\u201d Jones wrote in note.\n\nThe tech firms aren\u2019t just making money \u2014 they\u2019re doing so on a sustained basis and cruising past their prior year earnings even amid a global pandemic crippling other parts of the economy.\n\n\u201cBears will start to make comparisons to the \\[dot-com bubble\\] of the late nineties,\u201d David Nelson, chief strategist of Belpointe Asset Management, wrote in a note Tuesday. \u201cAs a veteran of that war I can tell you there's little resemblance. While valuations are stretched most of the big cap secular growth stocks are profitable. That was not the case in 2000.\u201d\n\n Take Apple. [In the second quarter of 2020](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-q2-earnings-2020-203115363.html), the pandemic shuttered production facilities in China and then forced it to close stores around the world outside of Mainland China. The company still managed to increase revenue year-over-year by 1% to $58.3 billion. [In Q3 2020](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-q3-earnings-2020-203224360.html), the company saw revenue grow 11% year-over-year to $59.7 billion.\n\nAmazon and Microsoft, meanwhile, have already been on a roll thanks to the performance of their cloud platforms as the pandemic spurs demand for such services. Amazon, of course, has also benefited immensely thanks to its positioning as a lifeline for essential goods when many people were stuck in their homes in the early portion of the pandemic.\n\nGoogle\u2019s parent Alphabet was the outlier, with revenue decreasing year-over-year [in Q2 2020](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-googl-q2-earnings-revenues-214509856.html) by 2%, partly due to a pullback in ad sales.\n\n## The tech industry has been a bright spot despite recent volatility\n\nThose performance metrics come as entire swaths of the economy have been decimated by the coronavirus pandemic including the hotel business and airlines. STR, [a data analytics firm for the hospitality industry](https://str.com/press-release/str-us-hotel-results-week-ending-29-august), found the U.S. hotel occupancy was down 27% year-over-year for the week ending Aug. 29. What\u2019s more, revenue per room was off 44.5%.\n\nThe airline industry has laid off thousands, as consumers either avoid airports entirely or are unable to travel internationally. Airlines including American ([AAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAL?p=AAL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), Delta ([DAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DAL?p=DAL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), and United ([UAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UAL?p=UAL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) have even gone as far as to eliminate change fees on domestic flights to further entice consumers to fly.\n\nThe restaurant industry has been similarly impacted by the virus, first by shutdowns and then by an inability to host in-door dining in some states.\n\nAs Jones explains, there\u2019s little else for investors to be excited about outside of Big Tech. According to his note, there\u2019s been no surge in call options for equity indices, indicating investors were willing to buy, while there has been a slight increase in put volumes, indicating investors are willing to sell if the price is right.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that investors\u2019 primary concern has been protecting themselves against broad-based weakness, the opposite of the caution-to-the-wind behavior you might expect to see in a bubble,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn other words, investors have likely been looking at tech as a safe haven while other industries struggled amid the pandemic.

I upped it to 100k after feeling like i knew what i was doing.  \n6-7 months later, i'm at 200k. I was wondering whether this is a success story or normal. I've done over several hundred of trades to reach this point.\n\nI thought i'd share this in case it helps anyone and also for gloating purposes. Also open to advice from more experienced people. See below what i've done to reach 100% return in 7 months.\n\n**How i pick a stock**\n\n* I look for opportunities by researching online news, reddits, i do my own technical analysis, i follow 1-2 people on tradingview who's ideas are most of the time accurate etc.\n\n**How often do i trade?**\n\n* Every few days. During non hype or Earnings/Dividend periods, i'll typically buy on one day and sell the next with \\~2-5% profit. Rarely, i'll catch a 10% pump on an individual stock.\n\n**How many stocks am i invested in at any given time?**\n\n* Usually 2. Rarely when i'm very sure that a stock will do well, i'll go 70%-100% yolo on it. \n\n**Strategy?**\n\n* The reason why i keep a small amount of stocks in my portfolio is so that i can more easily monitor/guesstimate the market sentiment. \n* I have plenty of price alerts on the stocks i monitor. If one drops by a bit, i quickly open up tradingview and see what various indicators like the RSI or F1 Ducks (as well as a few others) to see how far off my own technical analysis is. This is typically enough to tell me whether i should hold or sell and it's served me well just moments before big selloffs where I've lost only 2% instead of 8% for example.\n* During non dividend/earnings or release periods, when there's nothing special going on for a stock and it's stagnant, i'll take profits at +2-5%. During special periods, i'll take profits at 5-11%, sell and rebuy what are usually minor dips before the next pump. This means buying on one day and selling the next. Sometimes i have to use a day trade to lock in max profits.\n\n**Most traded stocks**\n\n* **AMD.** Corona AMD Q1 was easy to trade as if you did a basic technical analysis, you'd see that its very cyclical and you can easily tell where to buy in and where to exit. The Q2 earnings period was a no brainer for me. Corona bulged up the datacenter market due to computing needs. I run a video web conferencing platform similar to zoom and we grew 1300% during corona. We had to increase our datacenter capacity similarly. Near the end of Q2 is where the platform fell to 400% usage and we stopped renting many of our servers. This tells me Q3 for AMD will be normal. Stocks like Zoom will have to drop a bit. This stock made me plenty of money.\n* **TSMC.** Only traded it a few times recently when it was going up. Made me plenty of money.\n* **GOOGL.** Traded it during corona when it was at it's lows. Made me plenty of money.\n* **MSFT.** Only traded it a few times recently when it was going up. Made me decent money.\n* **NIO.** Only traded it a few times recently when it was going up. Made me money.\n* **Sutter Rock Capital.** I trade it every now and then. Made me money. Has weird +10% days.\n* **UPS.** Traded it during Corona. Made me money.\n* **Nvidia.** I trade it every now and then. Made me decent money.\n* **MGM.** Traded it during Corona. Made me money.\n* Plenty more...\n\n**Stocks i lost money on**\n\n* United States Steel. Would buy again, but to make any profit i'd need to wait several years.\n* Embraer. Would buy again at it's current price, but i'd need to wait several years for a good return. \\~400% within the decade is what i expect.\n* TherapeuticsMD\n* Nbev, Ambev. Trash, never buy these. Nbev specifically had a repeating pattern of spiking by +1300% every 2 years that was supposed to repeat this year 2020, but didn't. Was the only reason i bought it. Beyond this, it's a very mediocre penny stock. I watched one of the live earnings broadcasts, sounded like they were run by a bunch of headless chickens.\n* Constellation Brands. (Corona Beer)\n\n**What i'm currently trading**\n\nNvidia. I'm all in on Nvidia. I expect 518 by the \\~10th of September.

I upped it to 100k after feeling like i knew what i was doing.  \n6-7 months later, i'm at 200k. I was wondering whether this is a success story or normal. I've done over several hundred of trades to reach this point.\n\nI thought i'd share this in case it helps anyone and also for gloating purposes. Also open to advice from more experienced people. See below what i've done to reach 100% return in 7 months.\n\n**How i pick a stock**\n\n* I look for opportunities by researching online news, reddits, i do my own technical analysis, i follow 1-2 people on tradingview who's ideas are most of the time accurate etc.\n\n**How often do i trade?**\n\n* Every few days. During non hype or Earnings/Dividend periods, i'll typically buy on one day and sell the next with \\~2-5% profit. Rarely, i'll catch a 10% pump on an individual stock.\n\n**How many stocks am i invested in at any given time?**\n\n* Usually 2. Rarely when i'm very sure that a stock will do well, i'll go 70%-100% yolo on it. \n\n**Strategy?**\n\n* The reason why i keep a small amount of stocks in my portfolio is so that i can more easily monitor/guesstimate the market sentiment. \n* I have plenty of price alerts on the stocks i monitor. If one drops by a bit, i quickly open up tradingview and see what various indicators like the RSI or F1 Ducks (as well as a few others) to see how far off my own technical analysis is. This is typically enough to tell me whether i should hold or sell and it's served me well just moments before big selloffs where I've lost only 2% instead of 8% for example.\n* During non dividend/earnings or release periods, when there's nothing special going on for a stock and it's stagnant, i'll take profits at +2-5%. During special periods, i'll take profits at 5-11%, sell and rebuy what are usually minor dips before the next pump. This means buying on one day and selling the next. Sometimes i have to use a day trade to lock in max profits.\n\n**Most traded stocks**\n\n* **AMD.** Corona AMD Q1 was easy to trade as if you did a basic technical analysis, you'd see that its very cyclical and you can easily tell where to buy in and where to exit. The Q2 earnings period was a no brainer for me. Corona bulged up the datacenter market due to computing needs. I run a video web conferencing platform similar to zoom and we grew 1300% during corona. We had to increase our datacenter capacity similarly. Near the end of Q2 is where the platform fell to 400% usage and we stopped renting many of our servers. This tells me Q3 for AMD will be normal. Stocks like Zoom will have to drop a bit. This stock made me plenty of money.\n* **TSMC.** Only traded it a few times recently when it was going up. Made me plenty of money.\n* **GOOGL.** Traded it during corona when it was at it's lows. Made me plenty of money.\n* **MSFT.** Only traded it a few times recently when it was going up. Made me decent money.\n* **NIO.** Only traded it a few times recently when it was going up. Made me money.\n* **Sutter Rock Capital.** I trade it every now and then. Made me money. Has weird +10% days.\n* **UPS.** Traded it during Corona. Made me money.\n* **Nvidia.** I trade it every now and then. Made me decent money.\n* **MGM.** Traded it during Corona. Made me money.\n* Plenty more...\n\n**Stocks i lost money on**\n\n* United States Steel. Would buy again, but to make any profit i'd need to wait several years.\n* Embraer. Would buy again at it's current price, but i'd need to wait several years for a good return. \\~400% within the decade is what i expect.\n* TherapeuticsMD\n* Nbev, Ambev. Trash, never buy these. Nbev specifically had a repeating pattern of spiking by +1300% every 2 years that was supposed to repeat this year 2020, but didn't. Was the only reason i bought it. Beyond this, it's a very mediocre penny stock. I watched one of the live earnings broadcasts, sounded like they were run by a bunch of headless chickens.\n* Constellation Brands. (Corona Beer)\n\n**What i'm currently trading**\n\nNvidia. I'm all in on Nvidia. I expect 518 by the \\~10th of September. After that, i'm looking for a good entry point on AMD which should correct itself a bit within the next 30 days as there's no more momentum by AMD right now to excuse consolidation at the 85 dollar price.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/the-jobs-report-and-congressional-politics-may-matter-more-for-markets-than-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The market could lose some of its exuberance in the week ahead as the calendar turns to August, and investors await Friday\u2019s July employment report and keep their eyes on Washington.\n*****\n&gt; The focus will also be squarely on politicians, as Congress struggles to find a middle ground on a new fiscal spending package and decide the fate of the $600 a week unemployment supplement that was set to expire July 31. Former vice president Joe Biden is also expected to name his running mate in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; The jobs data will be crucial, particularly since the number of people filing for unemployment benefits has been edging higher, instead of falling back, as expected. According to Refinitiv, about 1.36 million new jobs are expected, well below the 4.8 million added in June, and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.7% from 11.1%.\n*****\n&gt; Trading around the report could be volatile, since some economists expect more than 2 million jobs were added, and some even see flat or negative payrolls.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have done well for the month of July, with the S&amp;P 500 finishing at 3,271, a gain of 5.5%. The Nasdaq has performed the best, rising 6.8% for the month to 10,745, after a 3.7% gain for the past week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAugust has traditionally been a challenging month for investors,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The market is entering what historically has been the worst two months for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; According to Stovall, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher in August 53% of the time, and its average move is a gain of just 0.01%, going back to World War II. September is worse, down 0.51% on average, and up just 48% of the time.\n*****\n&gt; In presidential election years, however the odds for August gains are better, as it rose 63% of the time and 73%, when the incumbent is up for re-election.\n*****\n&gt; There are also about 120 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, but the big earnings show for markets was this past week when four of the five biggest tech giants all reported Thursday afternoon. Three of those stocks \u2014 Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 surged, helping Nasdaq outperform Friday with a more than 1.5% gain.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings scorecard\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re only a month into the reporting period, and things are going to become less and less important from an earnings perspective,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cI think investors are sort of disappointed in that the bar was set so low for second quarter earnings that expectations were that we were going to see a lot of companies beat, which we have. But we were also going to see a gradual uplift of earnings expectations for forward quarters. We\u2019re not seeing that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Eighty-two percent of the companies reporting so far have beaten estimates, well above the average 65%, according to Refinitiv. The earnings decline is now looking closer to 33% from an initial 40%, and tech, which has been leading the market is one of the best performers. Profits for the sector now look to be up 1.4%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Because the tech names have contributed so much to market gains, their earnings were an important test for the market, and they didn\u2019t disappoint. But they didn\u2019t manage to pull up the whole market very far on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Among the names reporting in the coming week are a diverse group, including Disney, ViacomCBS, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Berkshire Hathaway, AIG, Clorox, and Wayfair, to name a few.\n*****\n&gt; # Politics now in play\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings story is over. My call had been once we had gotten through the earnings season, we would be more vulnerable to a sustainable pullback,\u201d said Barry Knapp, Ironside Macroeconomics managing partner and director of research. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s volatility season, but it\u2019s also an election year. ... We\u2019re more vulnerable to that next week and earnings won\u2019t hold us up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said if President Donald Trump and Republicans do not begin to perform better in the polls by Labor Day, the market is likely to focus on what a Democratic win would mean for taxes and regulation. That could be a negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf he hasn\u2019t made headway by then, it\u2019s likely he\u2019s done.That\u2019s about the point when things become pretty set in stone. The market will presume that\u2019s the case,\u201d Knapp said.\n*****\n&gt; The politics of the stimulus package could also reverberate through markets, until it looks like the Senate Republicans and House Democrats can find common ground.\n*****\n&gt; The two sides look to be at a standoff, but an agreement is still expected in early August. The market is particularly watching to see what happens with the enhanced unemployment benefits. Republicans have proposed cutting it to $200, but Democrats support keeping it.\n*****\n&gt; # The economy\n&gt; Cutting the size of the payments back might be good for the labor market and persuade more workers to return to work, some strategists say. However, there is also concern that the funding has helped stimulate the economy and keep the unemployed from defaulting on loans and payments. Consumer spending on goods in June was even higher than last year, and that was also seen as getting a lift from stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the jobs report, there are other important data like ISM manufacturing on Monday. There are also monthly vehicle sales Monday, and ISM nonmanufacturing data Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the macro data is going to be fine next week,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cI\u2019m not in the camp that thinks the payroll number is going to be negative.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; NatWest Markets economist Kevin Cummins is one of the economists who expects the jobs gains to be much smaller than the past two months. He expects the payrolls to come in at just 200,000. \u201cYou look at jobless claims, and you see a stalling out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Fed is right. There is significant downside risk to the economy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # A trade to watch\n&gt; Treasury yields, in the 2-year to 7-year range, fell to new lows in the past week. The 10-year yield, not yet at a record low, was also falling and was at 0.53% Friday. At the same time, the dollar was down more than 1% on the week and 4% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Gold was a beneficiary of the lower interest rates, weaker dollar trade, rising about 5% for the week and 10% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Strategist say investors are reacting to super-low interest rates, concerns about the economy, and the possibility that huge government spending will send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Investors are also jumping into inflation-protected bonds. According to Refinitiv\u2019s Lipper, inflation-protected bond funds took in $271 million of net new money for the fund-flows week ended July 29, the sixth week of gains. About $1 billion went into the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, (GLD) in the last week, Lipper said.\n*****\n&gt; During this time period, the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities funds recorded their two best weekly net inflows ever with increases of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the fund-flows weeks of June 24 and July 1.\n*****\n&gt; Lipper said investors started to put money into TIPS funds in the middle of the second quarter, and the flows have been . net positive in 11 out of 13 weeks since the beginning of May. This its second-worst quarterly net outflows ever as oil prices slumped in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this is going to be a much more inflationary decade. It will start out slowly. [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell is right that more forces are putting downward pressure on inflation at present. But the market looks past that,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cThe big story in 2021 will be the recovery of inflation. You\u2019re already seeing it in import prices.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Vu3udbe.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/h0BBbe1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LKORgeK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/MZnSQFC8/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LhH7odo.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/p9QIWyG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HmN0IBf.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZlnNJZU.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/wvkv3FfP/er83720.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vu4Bq8q.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/kKZeaRL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/O6zeqaG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SkGddqX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/5XLqRrO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/zl5gQpo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August: Top NASDAQ &amp; Russell 2000 Month of Election Years\n\n&gt; August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 32 years, 1988-2019 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.\n\n&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%\u2014which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts\u2019 average decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e8afe7e1e8656f8b9beeaf3291cf8f62/02ca1964ef3531ea-f0/s400x600/77f035157f33a261b7608dc9cc36fc09a768f385.jpg))**\n\n&gt; However, in election years since 1950, Augusts\u2019 rankings improve: #6 DJIA, #5 S&amp;P 500, #1 NASDAQ (since 1971), #1 Russell 1000 and #1 Russell 2000 (since 1979). This year, the market\u2019s performance in August will likely depend heavily on how July closes and whether or not the rate of covid-19 infection continues to accelerate which could force some areas to roll back reopenings.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August\u2019s First Trading Day Bearish Last 23 Years\n\n&gt; From the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 (page 88), it is known that the first trading days of each month combined gain nearly as much as all other days combined. However, the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2020 Almanac. In the past 23 years DJIA has risen just 30.4% (up 7, down 16) of the time on the first trading day of August. Average and median losses are on the mild side due to a few sizable advances. Over the past nine years, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have both declined nine times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8f6234b8e365d9e861563b4d5b2efa5d/42d5f6b50757b324-8c/s500x750/6269fe4480533724c565c9852bf543a4c59ea172.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Stronger Underneath the Surface\n\n&gt; Earlier today we posted a chart showing S&amp;P 500 sector performance since the Nasdaq's recent peak on 7/20 when Technology stocks began what has now been a 10-day period of consolidation. Below we have updated these performance numbers to include today's moves. While not as many sectors remain in positive territory, the majority of sectors continue to outperform the S&amp;P 500, while Technology drags the market lower. Along with Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary are the only other sectors that have lagged the S&amp;P 500, and their performance has been dragged down by the mega-cap tech-like stocks of Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Expanding on this theme of underlying strength in the index, the chart below shows the average performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 grouped by sector. On an equal-weighted basis, the S&amp;P 500 is actually up 1.3% since 7/20, and only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen negative average returns. On the upside, Real Estate (4.1%) has been the big winner followed by Consumer Discretionary (3.3%), and Consumer Staples (2.2%). The fact that Consumer Discretionary at the cap-weighted sector level is down over 1.4% while the average performance of stocks in the sector has been a gain of 3.3% illustrates what a mammoth impact AMZN has on that sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Breadth among S&amp;P 500 stocks has also been overwhelmingly positive. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, 59% of stocks in the index have had positive returns since the close on 7/20. Only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen fewer than half of their components post positive returns over that time, while Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Utilities have seen roughly three-quarters of their components rally since 7/20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Percent-Up1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far\n\n&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**\n\n&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/eps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # China Running Away YTD\n\n&gt; Every Wednesday, we publish our Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high-level summary of market and economic data of some of the world's largest economies. Of the 23 stock markets tracked, just six including the US are positive year to date at the moment (in local currency). In the chart below we show the YTD performance of these six countries as well as the global median in 2020. As shown, even though it was actually the first to tip into the green YTD following the global sell-off in February and March very briefly back in early June, the US is up the least of this group with a YTD gain of 0.4%. China's stock market is up the most at +14%. Taiwan, South Korea, South Africa, and Malaysia are also outperforming the US but are up more modestly than China with the best of these, Taiwan, gaining 4.53% this year. Meanwhile, the median country in our Global Macro Dashboard remains down 6.2% YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-GMD-ytd.png))**\n\n&gt; Given it is up the most on a year to date basis, China has also gained the largest share of global equity market cap in 2020. As shown in the table below, China has gained 1.7 percentage points of global market cap in 2020 and now takes up 10.14%. China now joins the US as the only other country with a double-digit share of total world market cap. Despite this, China has actually lost share since the bear market lows on 3/23. Meanwhile, the US, Germany, Canada, India, South Korea, and Australia have all gained a significant share since 3/23.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-Mkt-Cap-World.png))**\n\n&gt; # Do the Top 5 Stocks Pose a Risk to the Market?\n\n&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. These five stocks have helped spawn a number of acronyms as they try to capture the rise of mega-cap tech stocks that have led the market higher for much of the past decade. The average return for those five stocks so far this year has been a gain of more than 30%, while the broad S&amp;P 500 Index is just marginally positive, at 0.4% through July 30.\n\n&gt; While many other areas of the market have remained largely static, the total market value of these stocks has dramatically increased, making them an increasingly large piece of market cap-weighted indexes such as the S&amp;P 500. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the combined weight of the top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 has increased to its highest level ever, at nearly 22%. Only one of those five stocks (Microsoft) was a top five name in the index during the previous peak of March 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But does this pose a risk to the index? From a diversification standpoint, one could certainly argue it does. For instance, if any shared risks should come up, from regulation, for example, it could do outsized damage to cap-weighted indexes. However, we believe that the recent gains have been justified by the fundamentals, and we continue to favor both large caps over small caps, and growth-style stocks over value stocks. According to analysis from Credit Suisse, over the past 12 months, the top five stocks in the index have grown revenues at 11.2% vs. just 0.8% for the rest of the S&amp;P 500. Further, the remainder of the S&amp;P 500 has subtracted roughly $17 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS), while the top five stocks have added more than $12.\n\n&gt; Finally, while these stocks have been the face of the recent \u201cstay-at-home trend\u201d and may be more insulated from broader economic weakness, they are far from the only stocks making money this year. On July 30, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index hit a new all-time high and is now up more than 15% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; \u201cAfter a huge run, many of these top stocks may be due for a pause,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, looking out over the next 6 to 12 months, we believe that investors will continue to place a premium on companies that are able to organically grow sales, especially in a low-growth environment.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/the-jobs-report-and-congressional-politics-may-matter-more-for-markets-than-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The market could lose some of its exuberance in the week ahead as the calendar turns to August, and investors await Friday\u2019s July employment report and keep their eyes on Washington.\n*****\n&gt; The focus will also be squarely on politicians, as Congress struggles to find a middle ground on a new fiscal spending package and decide the fate of the $600 a week unemployment supplement that was set to expire July 31. Former vice president Joe Biden is also expected to name his running mate in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; The jobs data will be crucial, particularly since the number of people filing for unemployment benefits has been edging higher, instead of falling back, as expected. According to Refinitiv, about 1.36 million new jobs are expected, well below the 4.8 million added in June, and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.7% from 11.1%.\n*****\n&gt; Trading around the report could be volatile, since some economists expect more than 2 million jobs were added, and some even see flat or negative payrolls.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have done well for the month of July, with the S&amp;P 500 finishing at 3,271, a gain of 5.5%. The Nasdaq has performed the best, rising 6.8% for the month to 10,745, after a 3.7% gain for the past week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAugust has traditionally been a challenging month for investors,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The market is entering what historically has been the worst two months for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; According to Stovall, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher in August 53% of the time, and its average move is a gain of just 0.01%, going back to World War II. September is worse, down 0.51% on average, and up just 48% of the time.\n*****\n&gt; In presidential election years, however the odds for August gains are better, as it rose 63% of the time and 73%, when the incumbent is up for re-election.\n*****\n&gt; There are also about 120 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, but the big earnings show for markets was this past week when four of the five biggest tech giants all reported Thursday afternoon. Three of those stocks \u2014 Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 surged, helping Nasdaq outperform Friday with a more than 1.5% gain.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings scorecard\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re only a month into the reporting period, and things are going to become less and less important from an earnings perspective,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cI think investors are sort of disappointed in that the bar was set so low for second quarter earnings that expectations were that we were going to see a lot of companies beat, which we have. But we were also going to see a gradual uplift of earnings expectations for forward quarters. We\u2019re not seeing that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Eighty-two percent of the companies reporting so far have beaten estimates, well above the average 65%, according to Refinitiv. The earnings decline is now looking closer to 33% from an initial 40%, and tech, which has been leading the market is one of the best performers. Profits for the sector now look to be up 1.4%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Because the tech names have contributed so much to market gains, their earnings were an important test for the market, and they didn\u2019t disappoint. But they didn\u2019t manage to pull up the whole market very far on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Among the names reporting in the coming week are a diverse group, including Disney, ViacomCBS, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Berkshire Hathaway, AIG, Clorox, and Wayfair, to name a few.\n*****\n&gt; # Politics now in play\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings story is over. My call had been once we had gotten through the earnings season, we would be more vulnerable to a sustainable pullback,\u201d said Barry Knapp, Ironside Macroeconomics managing partner and director of research. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s volatility season, but it\u2019s also an election year. ... We\u2019re more vulnerable to that next week and earnings won\u2019t hold us up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said if President Donald Trump and Republicans do not begin to perform better in the polls by Labor Day, the market is likely to focus on what a Democratic win would mean for taxes and regulation. That could be a negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf he hasn\u2019t made headway by then, it\u2019s likely he\u2019s done.That\u2019s about the point when things become pretty set in stone. The market will presume that\u2019s the case,\u201d Knapp said.\n*****\n&gt; The politics of the stimulus package could also reverberate through markets, until it looks like the Senate Republicans and House Democrats can find common ground.\n*****\n&gt; The two sides look to be at a standoff, but an agreement is still expected in early August. The market is particularly watching to see what happens with the enhanced unemployment benefits. Republicans have proposed cutting it to $200, but Democrats support keeping it.\n*****\n&gt; # The economy\n&gt; Cutting the size of the payments back might be good for the labor market and persuade more workers to return to work, some strategists say. However, there is also concern that the funding has helped stimulate the economy and keep the unemployed from defaulting on loans and payments. Consumer spending on goods in June was even higher than last year, and that was also seen as getting a lift from stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the jobs report, there are other important data like ISM manufacturing on Monday. There are also monthly vehicle sales Monday, and ISM nonmanufacturing data Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the macro data is going to be fine next week,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cI\u2019m not in the camp that thinks the payroll number is going to be negative.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; NatWest Markets economist Kevin Cummins is one of the economists who expects the jobs gains to be much smaller than the past two months. He expects the payrolls to come in at just 200,000. \u201cYou look at jobless claims, and you see a stalling out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Fed is right. There is significant downside risk to the economy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # A trade to watch\n&gt; Treasury yields, in the 2-year to 7-year range, fell to new lows in the past week. The 10-year yield, not yet at a record low, was also falling and was at 0.53% Friday. At the same time, the dollar was down more than 1% on the week and 4% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Gold was a beneficiary of the lower interest rates, weaker dollar trade, rising about 5% for the week and 10% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Strategist say investors are reacting to super-low interest rates, concerns about the economy, and the possibility that huge government spending will send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Investors are also jumping into inflation-protected bonds. According to Refinitiv\u2019s Lipper, inflation-protected bond funds took in $271 million of net new money for the fund-flows week ended July 29, the sixth week of gains. About $1 billion went into the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, (GLD) in the last week, Lipper said.\n*****\n&gt; During this time period, the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities funds recorded their two best weekly net inflows ever with increases of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the fund-flows weeks of June 24 and July 1.\n*****\n&gt; Lipper said investors started to put money into TIPS funds in the middle of the second quarter, and the flows have been . net positive in 11 out of 13 weeks since the beginning of May. This its second-worst quarterly net outflows ever as oil prices slumped in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this is going to be a much more inflationary decade. It will start out slowly. [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell is right that more forces are putting downward pressure on inflation at present. But the market looks past that,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cThe big story in 2021 will be the recovery of inflation. You\u2019re already seeing it in import prices.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Vu3udbe.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/h0BBbe1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LKORgeK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/MZnSQFC8/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LhH7odo.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/p9QIWyG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HmN0IBf.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZlnNJZU.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/wvkv3FfP/er83720.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vu4Bq8q.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/kKZeaRL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/O6zeqaG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SkGddqX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/5XLqRrO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/zl5gQpo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August: Top NASDAQ &amp; Russell 2000 Month of Election Years\n\n&gt; August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 32 years, 1988-2019 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.\n\n&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%\u2014which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts\u2019 average decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e8afe7e1e8656f8b9beeaf3291cf8f62/02ca1964ef3531ea-f0/s400x600/77f035157f33a261b7608dc9cc36fc09a768f385.jpg))**\n\n&gt; However, in election years since 1950, Augusts\u2019 rankings improve: #6 DJIA, #5 S&amp;P 500, #1 NASDAQ (since 1971), #1 Russell 1000 and #1 Russell 2000 (since 1979). This year, the market\u2019s performance in August will likely depend heavily on how July closes and whether or not the rate of covid-19 infection continues to accelerate which could force some areas to roll back reopenings.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August\u2019s First Trading Day Bearish Last 23 Years\n\n&gt; From the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 (page 88), it is known that the first trading days of each month combined gain nearly as much as all other days combined. However, the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2020 Almanac. In the past 23 years DJIA has risen just 30.4% (up 7, down 16) of the time on the first trading day of August. Average and median losses are on the mild side due to a few sizable advances. Over the past nine years, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have both declined nine times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8f6234b8e365d9e861563b4d5b2efa5d/42d5f6b50757b324-8c/s500x750/6269fe4480533724c565c9852bf543a4c59ea172.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Stronger Underneath the Surface\n\n&gt; Earlier today we posted a chart showing S&amp;P 500 sector performance since the Nasdaq's recent peak on 7/20 when Technology stocks began what has now been a 10-day period of consolidation. Below we have updated these performance numbers to include today's moves. While not as many sectors remain in positive territory, the majority of sectors continue to outperform the S&amp;P 500, while Technology drags the market lower. Along with Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary are the only other sectors that have lagged the S&amp;P 500, and their performance has been dragged down by the mega-cap tech-like stocks of Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Expanding on this theme of underlying strength in the index, the chart below shows the average performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 grouped by sector. On an equal-weighted basis, the S&amp;P 500 is actually up 1.3% since 7/20, and only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen negative average returns. On the upside, Real Estate (4.1%) has been the big winner followed by Consumer Discretionary (3.3%), and Consumer Staples (2.2%). The fact that Consumer Discretionary at the cap-weighted sector level is down over 1.4% while the average performance of stocks in the sector has been a gain of 3.3% illustrates what a mammoth impact AMZN has on that sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Breadth among S&amp;P 500 stocks has also been overwhelmingly positive. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, 59% of stocks in the index have had positive returns since the close on 7/20. Only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen fewer than half of their components post positive returns over that time, while Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Utilities have seen roughly three-quarters of their components rally since 7/20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Percent-Up1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far\n\n&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**\n\n&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/eps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # China Running Away YTD\n\n&gt; Every Wednesday, we publish our Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high-level summary of market and economic data of some of the world's largest economies. Of the 23 stock markets tracked, just six including the US are positive year to date at the moment (in local currency). In the chart below we show the YTD performance of these six countries as well as the global median in 2020. As shown, even though it was actually the first to tip into the green YTD following the global sell-off in February and March very briefly back in early June, the US is up the least of this group with a YTD gain of 0.4%. China's stock market is up the most at +14%. Taiwan, South Korea, South Africa, and Malaysia are also outperforming the US but are up more modestly than China with the best of these, Taiwan, gaining 4.53% this year. Meanwhile, the median country in our Global Macro Dashboard remains down 6.2% YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-GMD-ytd.png))**\n\n&gt; Given it is up the most on a year to date basis, China has also gained the largest share of global equity market cap in 2020. As shown in the table below, China has gained 1.7 percentage points of global market cap in 2020 and now takes up 10.14%. China now joins the US as the only other country with a double-digit share of total world market cap. Despite this, China has actually lost share since the bear market lows on 3/23. Meanwhile, the US, Germany, Canada, India, South Korea, and Australia have all gained a significant share since 3/23.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-Mkt-Cap-World.png))**\n\n&gt; # Do the Top 5 Stocks Pose a Risk to the Market?\n\n&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. These five stocks have helped spawn a number of acronyms as they try to capture the rise of mega-cap tech stocks that have led the market higher for much of the past decade. The average return for those five stocks so far this year has been a gain of more than 30%, while the broad S&amp;P 500 Index is just marginally positive, at 0.4% through July 30.\n\n&gt; While many other areas of the market have remained largely static, the total market value of these stocks has dramatically increased, making them an increasingly large piece of market cap-weighted indexes such as the S&amp;P 500. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the combined weight of the top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 has increased to its highest level ever, at nearly 22%. Only one of those five stocks (Microsoft) was a top five name in the index during the previous peak of March 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But does this pose a risk to the index? From a diversification standpoint, one could certainly argue it does. For instance, if any shared risks should come up, from regulation, for example, it could do outsized damage to cap-weighted indexes. However, we believe that the recent gains have been justified by the fundamentals, and we continue to favor both large caps over small caps, and growth-style stocks over value stocks. According to analysis from Credit Suisse, over the past 12 months, the top five stocks in the index have grown revenues at 11.2% vs. just 0.8% for the rest of the S&amp;P 500. Further, the remainder of the S&amp;P 500 has subtracted roughly $17 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS), while the top five stocks have added more than $12.\n\n&gt; Finally, while these stocks have been the face of the recent \u201cstay-at-home trend\u201d and may be more insulated from broader economic weakness, they are far from the only stocks making money this year. On July 30, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index hit a new all-time high and is now up more than 15% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; \u201cAfter a huge run, many of these top stocks may be due for a pause,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, looking out over the next 6 to 12 months, we believe that investors will continue to place a premium on companies that are able to organically grow sales, especially in a low-growth environment.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks face headwinds as investors look forward to a big earnings week, a Fed meeting and state reopenings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/stocks-face-headwinds-as-investors-look-forward-to-a-big-earnings-week-a-fed-meeting-and-state-reopenings.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The stock market is struggling to make headway, as a big week of events rolls around, including a Federal Reserve meeting, the first look at post-shutdown economic growth and earnings from more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s a busy week for earnings, and some of the biggest blue chips are likely to join the growing list of companies withdrawing guidance amid the uncertainty of how the coronavirus and shutdowns are impacting their business. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald\u2019s are among about 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&amp;P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia\u2019s plan to reopen.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it\u2019s a fundamental story,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said it\u2019s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that\u2019s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. \u201cPeople are watching what\u2019s going on in places like Georgia, but they\u2019re also watching what\u2019s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s really one thing that really matters. It\u2019s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed bazooka\n&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it\u2019s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what\u2019s working and the things that still need to happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tilley said the Fed\u2019s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. \u201cIt looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they\u2019ve come back in,\u201d he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank\u2019s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said this Fed meeting isn\u2019t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they\u2019re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re borrowing from a bank or whether you\u2019re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Economic impact\n&gt; First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.\n*****\n&gt; Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.\n*****\n&gt; The impact of that should show up in Friday\u2019s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,\u201d Tilley said.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings\n&gt; Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.\n*****\n&gt; An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It\u2019s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,\u201d said Golub. \u201cMy estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it\u2019s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that\u2019s too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. \u201cWe had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that\u2019s really bad.\u201d Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3vJvFZR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/B4Di7Fh.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/7XXBq3H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QyE3rll.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jyp5KqQ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fCYKkgg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PdPKvec.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sEY6EDm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QuCVREP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gkpOUiT.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GrUMf6m.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election-year Mays: DJIA\u2019s Second Worst Month\n\n&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fac23214c1353f0b68d7710f6f7886a1/2eed74513d6bc154-86/s400x600/2540f531fb63ceab611b44ad7e0a2c0165670319.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective\n\n&gt; One month ago today the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We\u2019ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we\u2019ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&amp;P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Picture-4.23.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we\u2019ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?\n\n&gt; \u201cThis remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Market-returns-4.20.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020\n\n&gt; The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy has performed so far this year.\n\n&gt; The \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.\n\n&gt; As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.\n\n&gt; Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far\n\n&gt; We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.\n\n&gt; As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/avgearn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators\n\n&gt; Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity index started off the week coming in at \u20134.19 which was well below estimates of \u20133. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)\n\n&gt; The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&amp;P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.\n\n&gt; In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Other honorable mentions not on this list reporting next week include industrial bell-weather Caterpillar (CAT), stocks likely benefiting from the COVID economy like Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Clorox (CLX), and finally, some travel and leisure stocks like Expedia (EXPE), Royal Caribbean (RCL), United Airlines (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Earnings-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Bounces Right Where It Was Supposed To\n\n&gt; With central banks around the world unleashing waves of liquidity, there have been heightened concerns that one result will be a decline in the purchasing power of our money. For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.\n\n&gt; Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/042320-Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$CBSH** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$CHKP** \n&gt; * **$MRK** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$WHR** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$BP** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$CLX** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$CMS** \n&gt; * **$CNX** \n&gt; * **$APRN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lRp3xer.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Yw1LKpH.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HW4ersg.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KnhCH1m.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XeUrTNF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/20sK5un.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QXrGzmn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tSP1S0Y.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Sn4QllI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DhxQrOU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1CpjzdJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/raeflTF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/43jb0Pu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/axhdXpO.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wiL7F9e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HZkJ2ai.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:00 PM ET on Thursday, April 30, 2020. The consensus earnings estimate is $6.35 per share on revenue of $73.42 billion and the Earnings Whisper \u00ae number is $6.84 per share. Investor sentiment going into the company's earnings release has 80% expecting an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are for earnings to decline year-over-year by 11.81% with revenue increasing by 22.98%.

Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald\u2019s are among about 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&amp;P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia\u2019s plan to reopen.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it\u2019s a fundamental story,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said it\u2019s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that\u2019s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. \u201cPeople are watching what\u2019s going on in places like Georgia, but they\u2019re also watching what\u2019s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s really one thing that really matters. It\u2019s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed bazooka\n&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it\u2019s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what\u2019s working and the things that still need to happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tilley said the Fed\u2019s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. \u201cIt looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they\u2019ve come back in,\u201d he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank\u2019s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said this Fed meeting isn\u2019t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they\u2019re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re borrowing from a bank or whether you\u2019re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Economic impact\n&gt; First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.\n*****\n&gt; Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.\n*****\n&gt; The impact of that should show up in Friday\u2019s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,\u201d Tilley said.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings\n&gt; Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.\n*****\n&gt; An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It\u2019s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,\u201d said Golub. \u201cMy estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it\u2019s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year.

To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fac23214c1353f0b68d7710f6f7886a1/2eed74513d6bc154-86/s400x600/2540f531fb63ceab611b44ad7e0a2c0165670319.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective\n\n&gt; One month ago today the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We\u2019ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we\u2019ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&amp;P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Picture-4.23.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we\u2019ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?\n\n&gt; \u201cThis remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Market-returns-4.20.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020\n\n&gt; The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy has performed so far this year.\n\n&gt; The \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.\n\n&gt; As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.\n\n&gt; Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far\n\n&gt; We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.\n\n&gt; As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/avgearn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators\n\n&gt; Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity index started off the week coming in at \u20134.19 which was well below estimates of \u20133. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)\n\n&gt; The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&amp;P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.\n\n&gt; In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Other honorable mentions not on this list reporting next week include industrial bell-weather Caterpillar (CAT), stocks likely benefiting from the COVID economy like Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Clorox (CLX), and finally, some travel and leisure stocks like Expedia (EXPE), Royal Caribbean (RCL), United Airlines (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Earnings-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Bounces Right Where It Was Supposed To\n\n&gt; With central banks around the world unleashing waves of liquidity, there have been heightened concerns that one result will be a decline in the purchasing power of our money. For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.\n\n&gt; Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/042320-Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$CBSH** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$CHKP** \n&gt; * **$MRK** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$WHR** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$BP** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$CLX** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$CMS** \n&gt; * **$CNX** \n&gt; * **$APRN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lRp3xer.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Yw1LKpH.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HW4ersg.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KnhCH1m.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XeUrTNF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/20sK5un.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QXrGzmn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tSP1S0Y.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Sn4QllI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DhxQrOU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1CpjzdJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/raeflTF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/43jb0Pu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/axhdXpO.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wiL7F9e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HZkJ2ai.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.

This would keep you from holding companies like GE and Exxon as they decline and likely lead to bigger returns, I'd guess.*\n\nHere are my findings, broken down into combined annual lots of $3000 for each portfolio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Year**|**Top 3 Market Cap**|**BIG 3 $1000 x 3 Lot  Value Today**|**Big 3 Lot Gain ($)** |**Big 3 Lot Gain (%)**|**SPY $3000 Lot Value Today**|**SPY Batch Gain ($)**|**SPY Batch Gain (%)**|**Big 3 - SPY Net Gain ($)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1996|GE, KO, XOM|$5,174.90|$2,174.90|72%|$13,823.64|$10,823.64|361%|\\-$8,648.74|\n|1997|GE, MSFT, XOM|$18,975.80|$15,975.80|533%|$11,413.15|$8,413.15|280%|$7,562.65|\n|1998|GE, MSFT, XOM|$12,473.44|$9,473.44|316%|$8,723.77|$5,723.77|191%|$3,749.67|\n|1999|GE, MSFT, XOM|$6,396.14|$3,396.14|113%|$6,880.45|$3,880.45|129%|\\-$484.31|\n|2000|CSCO, GE, MSFT|$3,875.26|$875.26|29%|$5,726.21|$2,726.21|91%|\\-$1,850.94|\n|2001|GE, MSFT, XOM|$9,060.78|$6,060.78|202%|$6,431.14|$3,431.14|114%|$2,629.64|\n|2002|GE, MSFT, XOM|$6,511.29|$3,511.29|117%|$7,374.77|$4,374.77|146%|\\-$863.48|\n|2003|GE, MSFT, XOM|$8,188.52|$5,188.52|173%|$9,554.42|$6,554.42|218%|\\-$1,365.90|\n|2004|GE, MSFT, XOM|$7,604.92|$4,604.92|153%|$7,597.19|$4,597.19|153%|$7.73|\n|2005|GE, MSFT, XOM|$7,547.51|$4,547.51|152%|$6,983.46|$3,983.46|133%|$564.05|\n|2006|GE, MSFT, XOM|$7,610.09|$4,610.09|154%|$6,780.97|$3,780.97|126%|$829.11|\n|2007|GE, MSFT, XOM|$6,583.31|$3,583.31|119%|$5,967.73|$2,967.73|99%|$615.57|\n|2008|GE, MSFT, XOM|$5,517.03|$2,517.03|84%|$5,793.42|$2,793.42|93%|\\-$276.39|\n|2009|MSFT, WMT, XOM|$11,796.00|$8,796.00|293%|$9,386.44|$6,386.44|213%|$2,409.56|\n|2010|AAPL, MSFT, XOM|$15,617.62|$12,617.62|421%|$7,554.60|$4,554.60|152%|$8,063.02|\n|2011|AAPL, CVX, XOM|$7,625.22|$4,625.22|154%|$6,699.63|$3,699.63|123%|$925.59|\n|2012|AAPL, MSFT, XOM|$11,920.97|$8,920.97|297%|$6,644.57|$3,644.57|121%|$5,276.41|\n|2013|AAPL, BRK-B, XOM|$6,117.07|$3,117.07|104%|$5,850.11|$2,850.11|95%|$266.96|\n|2014|AAPL, MSFT, XOM|$8,672.80|$5,672.80|189%|$4,614.14|$1,614.14|54%|$4,058.66|\n|2015|AAPL, BRK-B, XOM|$4,245.55|$1,245.55|42%|$4,113.33|$1,113.33|37%|$132.21|\n|2016|AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT|$7,645.98|$4,645.98|155%|$4,234.18|$1,234.18|41%|$3,411.80|\n|2017|AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT|$6,818.03|$3,818.03|127%|$3,772.26|$772.26|26%|$3,045.76|\n|2018|AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT|$4,901.87|$1,901.87|63%|$3,169.47|$169.47|6%|$1,732.41|\n|2019|AAPL, AMZN, MSFT|$5,225.28|$2,225.28|74%|$3,451.13|$451.13|15%|$1,774.14|\n|2020|AAPL, AMZN, MSFT|$3,339.98|$339.98|11%|$2,623.82|\\-$376.18|\\-13%|$716.16|\n||||||||||\n||**COST BASIS ($3000 x 25 years)**|**BIG 3 TOTAL VALUE TODAY (4/24/2020)**|**BIG 3 NET GAIN ($)**|**BIG 3 NET GAIN (%)**|**SPY TOTAL VALUE TODAY (4/24/2020)**|**SPY NET GAIN ($)**|**SPY NET GAIN (%)**|**BIG 3 - SPY NET GAIN**|\n|**TOTALS**|**$75,000**|**$199,45.35**|**$124,445.35**|**166%**|**$165,164.01**|**$90,164.01**|**120%**|**+$34,281.34**|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe annual Big 3 lot beat the annual SPY lot long-term 19 out of 25 years.

I sold all of mine back in 2016, fearing cuts to entitlement programs would essentially cut their workforce by 30% overnight. Those cuts never came, and now I want back in.  Grocery pickup and delivery has been the future for a while, but COVID seems to have fast tracked that transition. IMO, it will remain highly popular post pandemic, Walmart will expand on it, and 5 years from now &gt;70% of grocery sales will be a direct competition between them and **AMZN**. I'm taking this one as soon as the right opening appears, with the expectation of holding it long term.  \n\n**KO** \\- First share I ever bought, never let it go, added to it over the years, and might be adding more tomorrow.  Not much to say here. It's priced well and has a scheduled earnings report before opening bell on Tues.  The recent relative success of consumer markets (WMT, **AMZN**, **TGT**, COST) leads me to think that will be a positive report, and if I see nothing indicating otherwise, I'll try to stock up and ride the wave.  Big fan of **PEP** as well -- more diversified than **KO**, but KFC/Tacobell/PH will probably slow any aggressive gains for a while.\n\n**MSFT** \\- Grain of salt time. This is my favorite holding on the market, bar none. **MSFT** and **AMZN** have essentially held up the whole average during this rebound period. It's all about those beautiful beautiful clouds y'all. (military contracts don't hurt either, see **BA**...) It's always a good time to buy Microsoft. \n\nGOOG/**GOOGL** \\- has a bright future in similar areas to **MSFT**, but I hate companies that live and die by advertisement revenue. For that reason I have a very limited holding in only 1 out of the 2, and I stay away from FB and TWT as well.  ITS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME TO BUY MICROSOFT.\n\nT and **DAL** \\- like Coke, they both have earnings to report this week. I think Delta will produce a decent report which will confuse some who don't fully understand that the pandemic split quarters, and much of the carnage won't be known until the end of Q2. If it does bump up, I'll offload shares and buy back lower in the early summer. **DAL** has the best balance sheet as well as the second best executive team in the whole airline industry, and I don't see it going anywhere. T on the other hand looks to be primed for injury if they report negative earnings.  If they fall back below 26, I'm an AT&amp;T buyer all day long. \n\nNFLX - If it were my money, I'd wait for the (very likely) record high earnings report coming up, ride the wave, and sell high.  I'm not a fan of companies who can't seem to be profitable despite overwhelming popularity. Average NFLX account is accessed by &gt;8 users, but only paid for by 1. New competitors emerging. The whole company model just sketches me out. Go prove me wrong Netflix.... but I'll continue to pass for now.\n\nSNE - Gaming has grown in quarantine, Playstation 5 is set to release in the next 2 months, and the stock still has solid rebound potential from its high. I'm at a solid buy here, and I've never owned it before.... so thats exciting!\n\n**V** and **MC** \\- Every single reputable study shows that the very first debt people default on in a recession is their credit card bill. BE VERY CAREFUL HERE.\n\nTSLA - Volatile, Bullish, Enigmatic.... I have no idea what's happening here.  Tesla fanboy's overwhelming enthusiasm make market predictions hard. I'll buy if it drops below 580 again. Don't own any now. Damn sure wish I did....\n\nOther stuff I like right now - **BA**, **JNJ**, **LOW**, **SAVE**, **TDOC**, MDT, HD, **ABT**\n\nOther stuff I'm neutral on - **PG**, LUV, DIS, **NKE**, SHOP, **AMD**, **Oil stocks** (will likely go even lower next month), and **many many many others**.....\n\nOther stuff I hate right now - **AAPL**, cruise lines, or any company that can't survive another big dip.

Big fan of **PEP** as well -- more diversified than **KO**, but KFC/Tacobell/PH will probably slow any aggressive gains for a while.\n\n**MSFT** \\- Grain of salt time. This is my favorite holding on the market, bar none. **MSFT** and **AMZN** have essentially held up the whole average during this rebound period. It's all about those beautiful beautiful clouds y'all. (military contracts don't hurt either, see **BA**...) It's always a good time to buy Microsoft. \n\nGOOG/**GOOGL** \\- has a bright future in similar areas to **MSFT**, but I hate companies that live and die by advertisement revenue. For that reason I have a very limited holding in only 1 out of the 2, and I stay away from FB and TWT as well.  ITS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME TO BUY MICROSOFT.\n\nT and **DAL** \\- like Coke, they both have earnings to report this week. I think Delta will produce a decent report which will confuse some who don't fully understand that the pandemic split quarters, and much of the carnage won't be known until the end of Q2. If it does bump up, I'll offload shares and buy back lower in the early summer. **DAL** has the best balance sheet as well as the second best executive team in the whole airline industry, and I don't see it going anywhere. T on the other hand looks to be primed for injury if they report negative earnings.  If they fall back below 26, I'm an AT&amp;T buyer all day long. \n\nNFLX - If it were my money, I'd wait for the (very likely) record high earnings report coming up, ride the wave, and sell high.  I'm not a fan of companies who can't seem to be profitable despite overwhelming popularity. Average NFLX account is accessed by &gt;8 users, but only paid for by 1. New competitors emerging. The whole company model just sketches me out. Go prove me wrong Netflix.... but I'll continue to pass for now.\n\nSNE - Gaming has grown in quarantine, Playstation 5 is set to release in the next 2 months, and the stock still has solid rebound potential from its high. I'm at a solid buy here, and I've never owned it before.... so thats exciting!\n\n**V** and **MC** \\- Every single reputable study shows that the very first debt people default on in a recession is their credit card bill. BE VERY CAREFUL HERE.\n\nTSLA - Volatile, Bullish, Enigmatic.... I have no idea what's happening here.  Tesla fanboy's overwhelming enthusiasm make market predictions hard. I'll buy if it drops below 580 again. Don't own any now. Damn sure wish I did....\n\nOther stuff I like right now - **BA**, **JNJ**, **LOW**, **SAVE**, **TDOC**, MDT, HD, **ABT**\n\nOther stuff I'm neutral on - **PG**, LUV, DIS, **NKE**, SHOP, **AMD**, **Oil stocks** (will likely go even lower next month), and **many many many others**.....\n\nOther stuff I hate right now - **AAPL**, cruise lines, or any company that can't survive another big dip. Nobody knows if it's coming. be smart.\n\nDo your thing Reddit, Have a spectacular week, and GOD BLESS AMERICA!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 606209, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Some thoughts going into this week", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g49lz5/some_thoughts_going_into_this_week/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1587306884.0}], [[], false, "HyperInflation2020", null, [], null, "text", "t2_5z5sq2xp", false, false, [], false, false, 1587294855, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g460p6/take_profits_in_your_tech_stocks_now/", {}, "g460p6", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "discussion", [], "8acd2324-65e6-11e5-a263-122ab0778f8b", "Discussion", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 115, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/g460p6/take_profits_in_your_tech_stocks_now/", false, 6, 1587294856, 1, "This is an objective take on things from a value investing perspective. I\u2019ve been a value investor my whole life. Granted, this hasn\u2019t served me well in the last couple of years. But overall, my value investment strategy has outperformed the market significantly over the years. I make investment decisions based on facts and numbers and hold cheap stocks long-term, regardless of current sentiment, FED buying, etc. This is what Warren Buffett does. I have been watching tech stocks becoming extremely expensive compared to usual over the last two years, so I hope to issue a warning to people investing in this space. \n\nTake ADBE, for example: its price-to-earnings ratio is 50x. A normal stock over a long period of time trades at an average Price-to-Earnings ratio of about 15x. So this is a very expensive stock from a value investing perspective, but they do dominate the market and make good profits. However, there are many so-called \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks in the NASDAQ today that have negligible profits (if at all). Think AMZN, UBER, SNAP, LYFT, and of course, TSLA. AYX is another one, trading on 296x earnings. These \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks trade on the sole basis of future growth, which is then supposed to lead to market domination one day, at which point the company is supposed to start making profits. \n\nSo people are paying eye-watering prices for dominant players like ADBE and MSFT, but they are ALSO paying even more eye-watering prices for \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks which will become profitable \u201cone day\u201d. There is a major flaw in this logic: \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks will never become profitable if the current dominant players continue to be dominant. **They cannot both win**. Profit margins for all tech stocks are currently very elevated, and the sector can only grow at the pace the economy is growing. It\u2019s simply not possible for ALL of these tech stocks to increase their market share and their profits. \n\nAfter it became clear that the US was heading into a recession thanks to COVID, people started piling into these already expensive tech stocks. A big part of the reason why is that tech did well in the previous financial crisis. People want somewhere to \u201chide\u201d from COVID, to wait it out. However, what these people may not have realized is that the situation today is very different to 10 years ago, when the tech sector was relatively un-impacted by the recession. Many of today\u2019s big names, such as AAPL, TSLA, NVDA, are involved in selling luxury items to consumers. This will take a bit hit. Other names such as FB and GOOGL will also take a massive hit, as the economic slowdown impacts online advertising revenue. You can think of FB and GOOGL as the real estate of the internet \u2013 back in 08/09 online retail was too busy expanding from a very low base to be hit by a generalised slowdown \u2013 but now these Tech stocks are too big not to be affected by prevailing economic conditions. The online advertising complex has a similar dichotomy to software. GOOGL and FB make all the profit. AMZN and other retailers are meant to be much more profitable one day \u2013 but that profitability would come at the expense of the online landlords. **Again, it doesn\u2019t make sense for EVERYTHING to be on a high valuation!**\n\nYou might be thinking: the NASDAQ has been exceptionally strong recently. Why don\u2019t I just buy a few stocks and see what happens. What can go wrong? The problem is that when there is a crash, things will go down VERY fast. You will likely not have the opportunity to get out of your stocks once things start going down properly. \n\nMany companies will be reporting their Q1 numbers soon. Many of them will avoid giving guidance for Q2, saying that their future performance is uncertain. However, one thing is certain: Q2 performance will be catastrophic across the board. Companies (especially tech companies that pay their employees in stocks) will try to keep the stock price up for as long as possible. However, they will have to report these bad numbers at some point. We don\u2019t know when the market will lose confidence in the sector as a whole \u2013 it\u2019s not possible for anyone to time this, even Warren Buffett. However, we can be sure that an actual decline in performance is coming, and when the market reacts to this, things may drop faster than you can react. \n\nTL;DR, tech stocks were already expensive pre-COVID, and are not the \u201csafe haven\u201d that some people believe them to be.

recession, and now it\u2019s more diversified\n\nWhile online-ad rivals like Facebook and Twitter were still startups with no revenue to speak of in the last recession, former Google CEO says search giant learned some lessons\n\n*This article is part of a series tracking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on major businesses and will be updated. It was originally published on April 8.*\n\nAlphabet Inc.\u2019s Google lords over the online-advertising market, which is both a blessing and a curse in the age of coronavirus.\n\nThe core business of Alphabet **GOOGL,** **+2.06%** **GOOG,** **+2.00%** commands roughly 30% of the $110 billion digital-advertising markets worldwide and is expected to maintain that lead in 2021 and beyond, according to eMarketer. YouTube is a big reason why, as it is expected to haul in $9.33 billion in 2020 and $11.4 billion in 2021, according to eMarketer. In February, Alphabet disclosed it brought in $15.1 billion in ads through YouTube in 2019, and $8.9 billion via Google Cloud.\n\nIf there is one company that will initially be hit hardest by ad cutbacks, it\u2019s Google. Up to 40% of its revenue comes from categories hard hit by COVID-19: in-person retail, restaurants, travel, automotive and small businesses. But it is also likely to be the first to rebound because of its market leadership.\n\n**Business in the age of COVID-19:** **Read profiles of how other large companies will be affected by the coronavirus**\n\nGoogle has been here before when it wasn\u2019t named Alphabet. During the recession sparked by the subprime-loan crisis a decade ago, sales remained at single-digit growth for five quarters in a row. Google\u2019s revenue estimates declined at least 15% in 2009 and 2010, with a marginally greater earnings hit, according to an analysis by MKM Partners.\n\nThen again, Google had the field all to itself more than a decade ago, before Facebook Inc. **FB,** **+3.22%**, Snap Inc. **SNAP,** **+9.25%**, and Twitter Inc. **TWTR,** **+8.78%** emerged as online ad rivals.\n\n\u201cBack then, I was told at the time the recovery is quicker than you think it is when you get there, and the strongest companies recover quicker than the weaker ones,\u201d former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said in a Zoom **ZM,** **+3.56%** conference with business executives, investors and media on April 7.\n\nAnalysts seem to agree, painting a picture of short-term pain but a quick recovery for Google.\n\n\u201cWe are modelling a \\[year-over-year\\] decline in Google revenues in Q2 followed by continued acceleration in revenues \\[in the second half\\],\u201d MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni said in an April 3 note. \u201cHowever, we do not expect Google to return to double-digit revenue growth until Q1 \u201921.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put this delicately, use the opportunity of the crisis to reconfigure and ensure the decisions you make now make you stronger when this lifts \u2014 a year or maybe less,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nIn 2008, for example, Google repriced stock options to employees to stabilize its workforce and retain talent.\n\n\u201cIt was the right decision at the time,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nSince the last recession, Google has also acted to diversify its business beyond search ads, with YouTube and Cloud accounting for more than 40% of incremental growth, MKM Partners reported.\n\nAlphabet reports fiscal first-quarter results on April 22.\n\nHow the numbers are changing\n\n**Revenue:** Average analyst expectations for the first quarter were $43.17 billion at the end of 2019, but have declined to $42.08 billion as of April 6. Estimates for Google websites, which account for most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, have declined from $30.32 billion to $29.73 billion in that time period, according to FactSet. For the full year, analysts expect revenue of $181.9 billion.\n\n**Earnings:** Average analyst expectations from FactSet were $12.31 per share at the end of 2019. As of April 6, they were $11.24 per share. For the full year, analysts expect earnings of $48.90 a share.\n\n**Stock movement:** During the first three months of 2020, Class A shares declined 13%. Google crested at $1,519.44 on Feb. 18 and closed at $1,183.19 on April 6.\n\nWhat the company is saying\n\nNot much. Notoriously tight-lipped Alphabet executives haven\u2019t said anything of note \u2014 either in SEC filings, news releases or blog posts \u2014 about the economic impact of coronavirus. What they have shared is mostly about a surge in traffic coursing over its network, prompting it to boost the capacity to handle demands on its network and data centers.\n\n**April 3:** \u201cOur priority now is how to meet the surge in demand,\u201d John Jester, vice president of customer experience at Google Cloud, told MarketWatch in a phone interview.\n\nIn a blog post, Google said traffic on its premium video conferencing property Meet has grown 60% day-over-day and is topping 2 billion minutes a day \u2014 25 times the traffic of a typical day.\n\n**Feb. 4:** Until the last two quarters, Google was conspicuously silent about breaking out revenue figures by product division. During its fiscal fourth quarter, it said YouTube was at $15 billion in annual ad revenue, and Cloud is on a $10 billion revenue run rate.\n\n\u2022 Online advertising is half of the global advertising, and Google has roughly 40% market share of online advertising. The math points toward an inevitable short-term disadvantage to Google, but a speedy recovery because of its clout, according to MKM Partners. \u201cWe expect Google advertising revenues to decelerate from \u2018high teens\u2019 (18% to 20%) during 2019 to 4% in 1Q:20, -1% in 2Q:20, and approx. +4% in 4Q20. We are raising our Google Cloud revenue assumptions as we expect a continued acceleration in the cloud, driven by sales force expansion and healthier end markets.\u201d \u2014 **MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni**, maintained his buy rating while trimming Alphabet\u2019s price target to $1,400 from $1,600 on April 3.\n\n\u2022 \u201cWe expect Google to have a greater near-term disadvantage but also have a faster recovery as pandemic effects reduce... We believe Alphabet will be more resilient vs. Facebook in weathering the advertising decline due to its lower exposure to the \\[small business\\] advertiser base. As a result of these top-line changes, our 2020 GAAP EPS estimate is now $40.56 (vs. prior estimate of $53.47) and our 2021 GAAP EPS is now $54.30 (vs. a prior estimate of $66.\u201d \u2014 **Citi analyst Jason Bazinet**, maintained a buy rating while trimming Alphabet\u2019s price target to $1,400 from $1,700 on April 1", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 587384, "public", "self", "Alphabet in the age of COVID-19: Google braved one recession, and now it\u2019s more diversified", 0, [], "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fxfxv7/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", "all_ads", 6, 1586379879.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "adamjonasbrother", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5wz7ou4w", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1586383479, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fxfxv7/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fxfxv7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/fxfxv7/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1586390327, "score": 0, "selftext": " \n\n# Alphabet in the age of COVID-19: Google braved one recession, and now it\u2019s more diversified\n\nWhile online-ad rivals like Facebook and Twitter were still startups with no revenue to speak of in the last recession, former Google CEO says search giant learned some lessons\n\n*This article is part of a series tracking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on major businesses and will be updated.

YouTube is a big reason why, as it is expected to haul in $9.33 billion in 2020 and $11.4 billion in 2021, according to eMarketer. In February, Alphabet disclosed it brought in $15.1 billion in ads through YouTube in 2019, and $8.9 billion via Google Cloud.\n\nIf there is one company that will initially be hit hardest by ad cutbacks, it\u2019s Google. Up to 40% of its revenue comes from categories hard hit by COVID-19: in-person retail, restaurants, travel, automotive and small businesses. But it is also likely to be the first to rebound because of its market leadership.\n\n**Business in the age of COVID-19:** **Read profiles of how other large companies will be affected by the coronavirus**\n\nGoogle has been here before when it wasn\u2019t named Alphabet. During the recession sparked by the subprime-loan crisis a decade ago, sales remained at single-digit growth for five quarters in a row. Google\u2019s revenue estimates declined at least 15% in 2009 and 2010, with a marginally greater earnings hit, according to an analysis by MKM Partners.\n\nThen again, Google had the field all to itself more than a decade ago, before Facebook Inc. **FB,** **+3.22%**, Snap Inc. **SNAP,** **+9.25%**, and Twitter Inc. **TWTR,** **+8.78%** emerged as online ad rivals.\n\n\u201cBack then, I was told at the time the recovery is quicker than you think it is when you get there, and the strongest companies recover quicker than the weaker ones,\u201d former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said in a Zoom **ZM,** **+3.56%** conference with business executives, investors and media on April 7.\n\nAnalysts seem to agree, painting a picture of short-term pain but a quick recovery for Google.\n\n\u201cWe are modelling a \\[year-over-year\\] decline in Google revenues in Q2 followed by continued acceleration in revenues \\[in the second half\\],\u201d MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni said in an April 3 note. \u201cHowever, we do not expect Google to return to double-digit revenue growth until Q1 \u201921.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put this delicately, use the opportunity of the crisis to reconfigure and ensure the decisions you make now make you stronger when this lifts \u2014 a year or maybe less,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nIn 2008, for example, Google repriced stock options to employees to stabilize its workforce and retain talent.\n\n\u201cIt was the right decision at the time,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nSince the last recession, Google has also acted to diversify its business beyond search ads, with YouTube and Cloud accounting for more than 40% of incremental growth, MKM Partners reported.\n\nAlphabet reports fiscal first-quarter results on April 22.\n\nHow the numbers are changing\n\n**Revenue:** Average analyst expectations for the first quarter were $43.17 billion at the end of 2019, but have declined to $42.08 billion as of April 6. Estimates for Google websites, which account for most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, have declined from $30.32 billion to $29.73 billion in that time period, according to FactSet. For the full year, analysts expect revenue of $181.9 billion.\n\n**Earnings:** Average analyst expectations from FactSet were $12.31 per share at the end of 2019. As of April 6, they were $11.24 per share. For the full year, analysts expect earnings of $48.90 a share.\n\n**Stock movement:** During the first three months of 2020, Class A shares declined 13%. Google crested at $1,519.44 on Feb. 18 and closed at $1,183.19 on April 6.\n\nWhat the company is saying\n\nNot much. Notoriously tight-lipped Alphabet executives haven\u2019t said anything of note \u2014 either in SEC filings, news releases or blog posts \u2014 about the economic impact of coronavirus. What they have shared is mostly about a surge in traffic coursing over its network, prompting it to boost the capacity to handle demands on its network and data centers.\n\n**April 3:** \u201cOur priority now is how to meet the surge in demand,\u201d John Jester, vice president of customer experience at Google Cloud, told MarketWatch in a phone interview.\n\nIn a blog post, Google said traffic on its premium video conferencing property Meet has grown 60% day-over-day and is topping 2 billion minutes a day \u2014 25 times the traffic of a typical day.\n\n**Feb. 4:** Until the last two quarters, Google was conspicuously silent about breaking out revenue figures by product division. During its fiscal fourth quarter, it said YouTube was at $15 billion in annual ad revenue, and Cloud is on a $10 billion revenue run rate.\n\n\u2022 Online advertising is half of the global advertising, and Google has roughly 40% market share of online advertising. The math points toward an inevitable short-term disadvantage to Google, but a speedy recovery because of its clout, according to MKM Partners. \u201cWe expect Google advertising revenues to decelerate from \u2018high teens\u2019 (18% to 20%) during 2019 to 4% in 1Q:20, -1% in 2Q:20, and approx. +4% in 4Q20.

YouTube is a big reason why, as it is expected to haul in $9.33 billion in 2020 and $11.4 billion in 2021, according to eMarketer. In February, Alphabet disclosed it brought in $15.1 billion in ads through YouTube in 2019, and $8.9 billion via Google Cloud.\n\nIf there is one company that will initially be hit hardest by ad cutbacks, it\u2019s Google. Up to 40% of its revenue comes from categories hard hit by COVID-19: in-person retail, restaurants, travel, automotive and small businesses. But it is also likely to be the first to rebound because of its market leadership.\n\n**Business in the age of COVID-19:** **Read profiles of how other large companies will be affected by the coronavirus**\n\nGoogle has been here before when it wasn\u2019t named Alphabet. During the recession sparked by the subprime-loan crisis a decade ago, sales remained at single-digit growth for five quarters in a row. Google\u2019s revenue estimates declined at least 15% in 2009 and 2010, with a marginally greater earnings hit, according to an analysis by MKM Partners.\n\nThen again, Google had the field all to itself more than a decade ago, before Facebook Inc. **FB,** **+3.22%**, Snap Inc. **SNAP,** **+9.25%**, and Twitter Inc. **TWTR,** **+8.78%** emerged as online ad rivals.\n\n\u201cBack then, I was told at the time the recovery is quicker than you think it is when you get there, and the strongest companies recover quicker than the weaker ones,\u201d former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said in a Zoom **ZM,** **+3.56%** conference with business executives, investors and media on April 7.\n\nAnalysts seem to agree, painting a picture of short-term pain but a quick recovery for Google.\n\n\u201cWe are modelling a \\[year-over-year\\] decline in Google revenues in Q2 followed by continued acceleration in revenues \\[in the second half\\],\u201d MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni said in an April 3 note. \u201cHowever, we do not expect Google to return to double-digit revenue growth until Q1 \u201921.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put this delicately, use the opportunity of the crisis to reconfigure and ensure the decisions you make now make you stronger when this lifts \u2014 a year or maybe less,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nIn 2008, for example, Google repriced stock options to employees to stabilize its workforce and retain talent.\n\n\u201cIt was the right decision at the time,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nSince the last recession, Google has also acted to diversify its business beyond search ads, with YouTube and Cloud accounting for more than 40% of incremental growth, MKM Partners reported.\n\nAlphabet reports fiscal first-quarter results on April 22.\n\nHow the numbers are changing\n\n**Revenue:** Average analyst expectations for the first quarter were $43.17 billion at the end of 2019, but have declined to $42.08 billion as of April 6. Estimates for Google websites, which account for most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, have declined from $30.32 billion to $29.73 billion in that time period, according to FactSet. For the full year, analysts expect revenue of $181.9 billion.\n\n**Earnings:** Average analyst expectations from FactSet were $12.31 per share at the end of 2019. As of April 6, they were $11.24 per share. For the full year, analysts expect earnings of $48.90 a share.\n\n**Stock movement:** During the first three months of 2020, Class A shares declined 13%. Google crested at $1,519.44 on Feb. 18 and closed at $1,183.19 on April 6.\n\nWhat the company is saying\n\nNot much. Notoriously tight-lipped Alphabet executives haven\u2019t said anything of note \u2014 either in SEC filings, news releases or blog posts \u2014 about the economic impact of coronavirus. What they have shared is mostly about a surge in traffic coursing over its network, prompting it to boost the capacity to handle demands on its network and data centers.\n\n**April 3:** \u201cOur priority now is how to meet the surge in demand,\u201d John Jester, vice president of customer experience at Google Cloud, told MarketWatch in a phone interview.\n\nIn a blog post, Google said traffic on its premium video conferencing property Meet has grown 60% day-over-day and is topping 2 billion minutes a day \u2014 25 times the traffic of a typical day.\n\n**Feb. 4:** Until the last two quarters, Google was conspicuously silent about breaking out revenue figures by product division. During its fiscal fourth quarter, it said YouTube was at $15 billion in annual ad revenue, and Cloud is on a $10 billion revenue run rate.\n\n\u2022 Online advertising is half of the global advertising, and Google has roughly 40% market share of online advertising. The math points toward an inevitable short-term disadvantage to Google, but a speedy recovery because of its clout, according to MKM Partners. \u201cWe expect Google advertising revenues to decelerate from \u2018high teens\u2019 (18% to 20%) during 2019 to 4% in 1Q:20, -1% in 2Q:20, and approx. +4% in 4Q20. We are raising our Google Cloud revenue assumptions as we expect a continued acceleration in the cloud, driven by sales force expansion and healthier end markets.\u201d \u2014 **MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni**, maintained his buy rating while trimming Alphabet\u2019s price target to $1,400 from $1,600 on April 3.\n\n\u2022 \u201cWe expect Google to have a greater near-term disadvantage but also have a faster recovery as pandemic effects reduce... We believe Alphabet will be more resilient vs. Facebook in weathering the advertising decline due to its lower exposure to the \\[small business\\] advertiser base. As a result of these top-line changes, our 2020 GAAP EPS estimate is now $40.56 (vs. prior estimate of $53.47) and our 2021 GAAP EPS is now $54.30 (vs. a prior estimate of $66.\u201d \u2014 **Citi analyst Jason Bazinet**, maintained a buy rating while trimming Alphabet\u2019s price target to $1,400 from $1,700 on April 1", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 587376, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Alphabet in the age of COVID-19: Google braved one recession, and now it\u2019s more diversified", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fxfuq7/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1586379587.0}], [[], true, "proprietism", null, [], null, "text", "t2_5uh4t6n5", false, false, [], false, false, 1585934432, "self.stocks", 1585934679, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fucesj/top_10_largest_companies_with_2_short_ratios/", {}, "fucesj", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 4, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/fucesj/top_10_largest_companies_with_2_short_ratios/", false, 6, 1585936230, 1, "People are often asking about which stocks they should put their money in.

Monday\u2019s rally put the S&amp;P 500 back into positive territory for 2020, and the projected gain for the Dow at the Tuesday open should do the same. Dow futures are currently projecting a 300+ point gain at the open. The Dow needs about 460 more points to erase that Friday slide. (CNBC)\n* The lone economic report out today comes at 10 a.m. ET, when the government issues December factory orders. Though a busy morning for earnings will see the latest numbers from Centene (CNC), Clorox (CLX), McKesson (MCK), Ralph Lauren (RL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Sirius XM (SIRI), among others.\n* Dow component Walt Disney (DIS) grabs the after-the-bell earnings spotlight, with Ford Motor (F), Aflac (AFL), Allstate (ALL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Match Group (MTCH), Seagate Technology (STX) and Snap (SNAP) also among those releasing quarterly numbers.

The tech giant did break out numbers for its YouTube and cloud businesses for the first time, though the disclosure was limited in scope. (CNBC)\n* Google still isn\u2019t telling us about a key metric for YouTube and cloud: Profits (CNBC)\n* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) soared nearly 20% in Monday\u2019s trading after Argus Research raised its price target and short-sellers scrambled to catch up to the stock. The move was the biggest one-day jump since May, 2013. In Tuesday\u2019s premarkets, Tesla stock was trading up nearly 3.4%. (CNBC)\n* Results from the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses were delayed until later today as the state\u2019s Democratic Party said a \u201creporting issue\u201d caused \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in some data. The top 2020 contenders (including Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren) will now focus on the New Hampshire primary one week from today. (CNBC)\n* Buttigieg claims victory in Iowa caucuses, though no results have been released (CNBC)\n* President Donald Trump will be unleashing \u201crelentless optimism\u201d during his third State of the Union address tonight, a speech designed to pivot from his impeachment to his drive for reelection. The theme of his speech: \u201cThe Great American Comeback.\u201d (AP)\n* The Republican-led Senate is poised to acquit Trump in a vote tomorrow afternoon. Yesterday\u2019s closing arguments offered Dems an opportunity to leave the viewing public with two final thoughts: Trump\u2019s actions were craven and corrupt, and that Trump still presents a clear danger to both national security and the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. (CNBC)\n* Hong Kong\u2019s Hospital Authority told CNBC that a 39-year-old man died this morning in the city\u2019s first death related to the coronavirus outbreak.

Chinese health officials said earlier that in mainland China the total now sits at 425 deaths and 20,438 confirmed cases.\n* No, garlic won\u2019t protect you from coronavirus: WHO pushes back on rampant misinformation (CNBC)\n* Coronavirus will likely become a pandemic, warns ex-FDA chief Scott Gottlieb (CNBC)\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) is in talks to offer small business loans to merchants on Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) sprawling e-commerce platform. The deal, if closed, would mark the second tech giant using Goldman as a back-end provider of bank-regulated services. (CNBC)\n* The FTC said it plans to sue to block Edgewell\u2019s $1.37 billion acquisition of shaving start-up Harry\u2019s, citing competition concerns in the consumer shaving space. The deal, announced last May, would give Edgewell access to Harry\u2019s data and subscription base. For Harry\u2019s, it would provide a platform through which to expand beyond its nine factories. (CNBC)\n* Influential right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh announced on his program that he has been diagnosed with \u201cadvanced lung cancer.\u201d Limbaugh, 69, said he will take time off his normal broadcast schedule to seek treatment.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

There are 49 analysts who cover the shares, and 47 of them are positive, with two neutral, according to FactSet. Only Alibaba Group Holding of China and ICICI Bank of India boast more endorsements.\n\nAnd after a record-setting run-up, Amazon\u2019s stock isn\u2019t obviously inviting. A $1,000 stake at the close of the stock\u2019s first day of trading in 1997 has turned into more than $950,000. The shares today, at $1,875, go for 69 times projected 2020 earnings.\n\nStill, buy Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN). The stock price looks sensible when compared with free cash flow, which is swelling quickly. Some growth initiatives are only now paying off. Don\u2019t expect a 35% gain this year, as Amazon has averaged, compounded, since going public. But don\u2019t rule it out, either.\n\nAmazon\u2019s reputation for operating near break-even has long been outdated. Founder Jeff Bezos has emphasized free cash flow over accounting earnings from the start, and Amazon has generated free cash since 2002. The company has tended to invest much of that cash for growth, and the result is that earnings have been positive only since 2014, and only meaningfully so since 2018. Now the numbers are reaching escape velocity.\n\nWhen 2019\u2019s results are released, Wall Street expects Amazon to report that revenue increased by 20%, to $279.1 billion; that earnings rose slightly, to $10.4 billion; and that free cash flow ballooned by 28%, to $24.9 billion. In 2020, free cash flow is expected to expand even faster, by 36%, to $34 billion.\n\nWithin five years, the consensus view is that Amazon will become the biggest free cash generator in America, passing some companies that aren\u2019t exactly standing still, like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). The simplest reason is that Amazon\u2019s investment spending can\u2019t keep up with its growth rate forever.\n\nAmazon launched Prime in 2005, with its free two-day shipping for members, and vast opportunities for the company to put capital to work building speedier infrastructure. Not long after, Amazon Web Services went into cloud computing, another path for investment. Both ventures have proved to be lucrative, with Prime spurring increased spending by shoppers, and AWS yielding generous profit margins.\n\nLast year, Amazon said that it would spend to shorten free Prime shipping to a single day. There are early signs of that paying off, too. Cowen analyst John Blackledge estimates that Prime membership grew 13% during the fourth quarter, versus a year earlier. That compares with 3% growth a year ago and would be the third straight quarter of acceleration.\n\nNow, consider another of Amazon\u2019s growth initiatives: advertising. A recent search for \u201cmen\u2019s tennis rackets\u201d on Amazon.com yielded editorial recommendations and a racket listing labeled \u201cAmazon\u2019s Choice.\u201d But nothing was more prominently displayed than the three sponsored racket listings near the top\u2014except for the paid ad for portable nets just above them.\n\nAdvertising doesn\u2019t require vast investments in fleets and data farms, and it looks like another boon for Amazon\u2019s growth. Ad revenue will rise 36%, to $17.6 billion, in 2020, and by 2025 will top $46 billion, predicts Cowen\u2019s Blackledge. Assuming a 35% operating margin for the business, he estimates that advertising and AWS will together account for 90% of operating income this year.\n\nThat has important implications for shareholders. First, it bodes well for the competitiveness of a store when it doesn\u2019t have to rely on its retail margins for the bulk of profits. Second, the advertising ramp provides another rich source of funds to invest in growth. Third, with Amazon passing the anniversary of its spending boost for Prime one-day, it is unclear that it will need that extra spending. As things stand, growth in capital expenditures is expected to decelerate from over 25% last year, to 16% this year, to under 10% in 2021.\n\nAmong 10 analysts who have estimated Amazon\u2019s free cash flow out to 2021, the lowest says $32.7 billion, the highest says $57.5 billion, and the average is $43.7 billion. Out to 2024, there are only three estimates, averaging $82.8 billion. Apple, in comparison, is expected to produce close to $63 billion in free cash during its current fiscal year through September.\n\nIf distant estimates for Amazon are feasible, or even if they are only moderately overblown, the stock could continue outperforming. At less than 30 times estimated 2020 free cash flow, it is cheaper than the shares of Visa (V), Nike (NKE), or McDonald\u2019s (MCD). From here, 20% annual gains for the next three years could leave the stock priced at a humbler 25 times free cash flow.\n\nA government crackdown against powerful tech titans is a risk, but Amazon may have a better \u201cwho me?\u201d defense than some of the others. Its market share in the public cloud is less than half, and falling, as Microsoft and others catch up. In e-commerce, more than half of its sales are from third-party merchants who pay to use its services. And in online advertising, it\u2019s a pipsqueak next to Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).\n\nAll told, Amazon is popular with stockpickers for good reason.

Cloud expansion and improved margin trends, expected to take shape during the second quarter, will be catalysts for the stock, the analysts said.\n\nBesides singling out Amazon (ticker: AMZN) as a top pick, the Baird team is generally bullish on platform technology companies such as Alibaba Group Holding (BABA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), urging investors: \u201cDon\u2019t bet against the internet!\u201d\n\nEven after all of the advancements in technology that defined the \u201cbustling\u201d 2010s, Baird analysts predict that the next decade will see a \u201cbounty of meaningful technology transitions,\u201d including quantum computing, artificial general intelligence, and the rollout of 6G.
