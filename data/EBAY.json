This has seen enormous growth and has even surpassed AliBaba in Southeast Asia, which is obviously a huge deal.\n\nThen they have their payments subsidiary, AirPay. As far as I know, this is a fairly popular mobile payment system in Southeast Asia and has seen massive growth in recent years.\n\nThen we get onto their financials. For the last three quarters, they've had \\*100%\\* YoY revenue growth. It's absolutely insane. What company of this size is posting 100% YoY revenue growth? I can't find a single one.\n\nCombining broad e-commerce (think amazon, walmart, etc.) with a payment network is an unbelievably strong place to be. Even without speculating, the numbers are insane. But imagine if they can offer you a discount on shopee when you use AirPay. They can get into an extremely dominant position. Then counting their gaming subsidiary, which is a massively growing company in a massively growing industry.\n\nFinally, it's my opinion that SEA is going to grow economically by a lot in the next 5-10 years. I won't get into why exactly but from what I can tell, barring a Chinese takeover of the region, they're well on their way to extremely advanced economies.\n\nTell me, what's not to like about this company?

Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.\n\n**Pros**: Affirm says its \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.\u00a0 As e-commerce grows, there\u2019s plenty of room for growth in the market\u2014less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d deals.

So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm\u2019s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.\n\n## Airbnb\n\nSymbol: ABNB  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  \nRevenue growth: -32%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $697 million\n\n[Airbnb\u2019s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)\n\nAs the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.\n\n**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb\u2019s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it\u2019s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.\n\n## DoorDash\n\nSymbol: DASH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  \nRevenue growth: 226%  \nGross margin: 53%  \nNet loss: $149 million\n\n[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)\n\nAfter moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash \u201cdashers\u201d deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.\n\n**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square\u2019s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.\n\n**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash\u2019s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash\u2019s business model.\n\n## Roblox\n\nSymbol: RBLX  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  \nRevenue growth: 68%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $206 million\n\n[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)\n\nMuch more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).\n\n**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans\u2019 app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.\n\n## Wish (ContextLogic)\n\nSymbol: WISH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  \nRevenue growth: 32%  \nGross margin: 65%  \nNet loss: $176 million\n\n[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)\n\nOvershadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the \u201caffordable\u201d segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.\n\n**Pros**: Shopping online isn\u2019t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish\u2019s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.\n\n**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish\u2019s business with new rules or requirements.\n\n[Source](https://fortune.com/2020/11/25/2020-ipos-airbnb-roblox-affirm-wish-doordash-predictions-going-public/)", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 936306, "public", "self", "Pros and cons of investing in 5 upcoming tech IPOs from Airbnb to Roblox", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3okkw/pros_and_cons_of_investing_in_5_upcoming_tech/", "all_ads", 6, 1606706169.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Brothanogood", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_d29iz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606709769, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3okkw/pros_and_cons_of_investing_in_5_upcoming_tech/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k3okkw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "news", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "866eb162-65e6-11e5-a903-1252b640afe9", "link_flair_text": "News", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 402, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/k3okkw/pros_and_cons_of_investing_in_5_upcoming_tech/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "YZThufOgjbQmNtM9g5eMe30Tl4edBKHVTN3lk3rszP8", "resolutions": [{"height": 54, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kOi9TBRluNNxyy8wVR6E_koe53uqbVLTUOG9SvTTBkQ.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db65023eea240e632ba51c2ed28f42a4339a8331", "width": 108}, {"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kOi9TBRluNNxyy8wVR6E_koe53uqbVLTUOG9SvTTBkQ.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71dcdeb9c8d36c1e8480378d32d48d92fa5e4ee6", "width": 216}, {"height": 160, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kOi9TBRluNNxyy8wVR6E_koe53uqbVLTUOG9SvTTBkQ.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e46075886102ce775161891ce4abad6a9ab0e1a3", "width": 320}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kOi9TBRluNNxyy8wVR6E_koe53uqbVLTUOG9SvTTBkQ.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=093444c45ff1d6ba904349954c9878c4b5fdc05f", "width": 640}, {"height": 480, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kOi9TBRluNNxyy8wVR6E_koe53uqbVLTUOG9SvTTBkQ.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccd38fa4f34e9e5680c8a5d1df876f3893d34663", "width": 960}, {"height": 540, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kOi9TBRluNNxyy8wVR6E_koe53uqbVLTUOG9SvTTBkQ.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13f6c680b8c1cd9375e2942782eb38004bf1e04b", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 600, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kOi9TBRluNNxyy8wVR6E_koe53uqbVLTUOG9SvTTBkQ.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=fdcbcd8d1170a3d7ebb1cb81b01a8cbc9ad8b6ca", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1606709780, "score": 1, "selftext": "December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception.

The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb\u2019s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it\u2019s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.\n\n## DoorDash\n\nSymbol: DASH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  \nRevenue growth: 226%  \nGross margin: 53%  \nNet loss: $149 million\n\n[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)\n\nAfter moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash \u201cdashers\u201d deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.\n\n**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square\u2019s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.\n\n**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash\u2019s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash\u2019s business model.\n\n## Roblox\n\nSymbol: RBLX  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  \nRevenue growth: 68%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $206 million\n\n[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)\n\nMuch more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).\n\n**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans\u2019 app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.\n\n## Wish (ContextLogic)\n\nSymbol: WISH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  \nRevenue growth: 32%  \nGross margin: 65%  \nNet loss: $176 million\n\n[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)\n\nOvershadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the \u201caffordable\u201d segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.\n\n**Pros**: Shopping online isn\u2019t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish\u2019s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.\n\n**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish\u2019s business with new rules or requirements.\n\n[Source](https://fortune.com/2020/11/25/2020-ipos-airbnb-roblox-affirm-wish-doordash-predictions-going-public/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 936306, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Pros and cons of investing in 5 upcoming tech IPOs from Airbnb to Roblox", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3okkw/pros_and_cons_of_investing_in_5_upcoming_tech/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1606706169.0}], [[], false, "mcapitelli", null, [], null, "text", "t2_ps5owf", false, false, [], false, false, 1606520245, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k2cb7o/how_much_of_digital_advertising_is_a_bubble/", {}, "k2cb7o", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "discussion", [], "8acd2324-65e6-11e5-a263-122ab0778f8b", "Discussion", "dark", "text", false, false, false, 4, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/k2cb7o/how_much_of_digital_advertising_is_a_bubble/", false, "self", {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "yrx7CpBGtFkwGYi7PxbKk7c96EMnnXebkJp6k7wbhDs", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/piksAl6eJug6JxQyUuabc6s6oQc-v4UxQpw5xVzd5Ek.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7920f06197df16f7cd7dc9fb868bd561458bfdd", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/piksAl6eJug6JxQyUuabc6s6oQc-v4UxQpw5xVzd5Ek.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fbca167141b09cd58f4f2d2366ca1cfab4b1555", "width": 216}, {"height": 168, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/piksAl6eJug6JxQyUuabc6s6oQc-v4UxQpw5xVzd5Ek.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aab9d156f1c04fd2dc6959764acf04e3d33f033b", "width": 320}, {"height": 336, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/piksAl6eJug6JxQyUuabc6s6oQc-v4UxQpw5xVzd5Ek.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21b71398c22069657932a476130d1dbe7924dee1", "width": 640}, {"height": 504, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/piksAl6eJug6JxQyUuabc6s6oQc-v4UxQpw5xVzd5Ek.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dae8a60142ee028a977cf57dcb8ee455138efd9a", "width": 960}, {"height": 567, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/piksAl6eJug6JxQyUuabc6s6oQc-v4UxQpw5xVzd5Ek.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16634d8a1b22ad81b3743b5447a7f21211e574e8", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 1260, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/piksAl6eJug6JxQyUuabc6s6oQc-v4UxQpw5xVzd5Ek.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=11e608fb280bb311c4804ed0b115270ddb8c0842", "width": 2400}, "variants": {}}]}, 6, 1606520256, 1, "The impetus for this question is a two-part Freakonomics podcast, \"Does Advertising Actually Work?\" In these episodes, the host discusses several flavors of advertising, including newspaper, TV and digital ads, the latter which has the largest implications for some of our highest performing companies over the past year.

E-commerce is the fastest growing economy and I know all of you already buy from Amazon Wayfair Etsy eBay shopify etc. I hope this brings some light to JMIA and if you aren\u2019t investing atleast open up to African economy. No rocket emojis. \n\nRead this if you want or scroll to the bottom: \n\nJumia Technologies AG operates an e-commerce platform in Africa.

Start saving money and INVEST IT\n\nThe most important thing is START SAVING MONEY RIGHT NOW AND INVEST IT, don\u2019t spend it on useless things that don\u2019t add value to you. Either knowledge value, net worth value or future prospect value. This is one of the things that I learned the hard way, as I was spending all my money and never saving and investing it, this has cost me a lot of real money and potential money as I have missed out on a lot of things so be sure and learn from other people\u2019s mistakes\n\n2. Number two has a lot to do with number one TRACK YOUR SPENDING AND IMPROVE IT BY REDUCING EXPENSES\n\nYou think you are doing everything you can to start saving money? Well you probably aren\u2019t if you are looking at this post. Start tracking all of your expenses by using your credit or debit card for almost every purchase you do and at the end of every month take your time and look over your statements. Are you satisfied with what you see? Are all your expenses really worth it? Are they adding value for you or future value? Probably not\u2026 Are you enjoying 10$ coffees when you can make our own at home for 50 cents? Is that brand name clothing or perfume adding value to you? You can easily get really nice clothes and great smelling perfumes for a lot less when not buying brand names. Another good idea is not to do groceries while you are hungry as you are tempted to buy much more food that you don\u2019t actually need and end up wasting it. Do you really need to pay 5$ to play candy crush? I don\u2019t believe so, you can find tons of games for free but wait a minute, why play games when you should try and do something that adds value to your life? Are you buying lottery tickets? Stop that right now, take that money and invest it. This are just a few examples that can improve your spending habits. Take your time every month and track your expense, cut out the stuff you don\u2019t need and you will start feeling a difference very soon.\n\n3. The number 3 tip is Don\u2019t rush just HAVE PATIENCE. I know, you want Lamborghini money in a week with nothing to start from, Yeah, me too but that is not gonna happen. You must learn to have patience and grow your net worth steadily over time, don\u2019t go on Wall street bets and trade options thinking you\u2019ll get rich by next month, that is a recipe for disaster. You might get lucky 1 in 10 thousand times but there are far better ways of making money. So be patient and take your time.  [SCREENSHOT](https://ibb.co/Q6wyg5h)\n\nMoving up to number 4, INVEST IN STOCKS\n\nHere you can see that if you had invested 30 years ago in 1 share of the SP that money would be worth 10 times that amount right now and even adjusted for inflation you would still be up huge [30 years SP](https://ibb.co/47wkSQq). With the annualized Average Return of investment being more than 6% [AVG RETURNS](https://ibb.co/54NpNZQ). Here you can see that you should not try to time the market as it is really hard to predict what is the best time to buy, you should just get into the stock market, you shouldn\u2019t probably dump all your money in one day. But you should be buying into the stock market every time you get paid would be a great thing to do. As being fully invested in the stock market in the past 30 years has return more than 7% annually, while missing just the 3 best days of the stock market every year could see you end up losing money.  [BEING FULLY INVESTED](https://ibb.co/Jnx6vsF)\n\nDon\u2019t know how the stock market goes? No worries number 5 will help you. INVEST IN ETF\u2019s. What are ETFs? ETFs are exchanged traded funds that you can buy just like stocks. They are very similar to index funds but have lower fees usually and you can find ETFs that track pretty much everything. What are Index funds? Index funds are mutual fonds that are managed by professional money managers and represent a theoretical segment of the stock market with the most important ones being the SP500 that tracks the 500 biggest companies listed on the US stock exchange, the Nasdaq Composite which includes almost all the companies that are listed on the Nasdaq stock market or the Nasdaq 100 which includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies in the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/xhzzqSf) and the [DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/T1jhmr9) that tracks the stock performance of the 30 larges companies listed in the United States. They all have ETFs that track them, [QQQ](https://ibb.co/JkWYL76) tracks the Nasdaq and also has a dividend yield of 0,56%, [SPY](https://ibb.co/T45kYff) tracks the SP500 and has a dividend yield of 1,6% while [DIA](https://ibb.co/Vwt1nGN) tracks the Dow Jones and has a dividend yield just over 2%. but you can also invest in ETFs that track sectors like [SMH](https://ibb.co/m5vZML4) which tracks the semiconductor sector and still has a dividend yield of more than 1% more than almost any bank is giving right now on savings account and also offer growth. Or if you like the airlines and think that they will return to the value they once have there is a ETF for that also under the ticker [JETS](https://ibb.co/bJYnSrL) or if you like banks [XLF](https://ibb.co/WK4BYb0) is a good ETF for those and you can also invest in real estate with tracking a real estate ETF, one for example is [XLRE](https://ibb.co/TWhbMdC) , there are many ETFs that you can choose from not only these one. And as long as you consistently invest money over time, it is almost guaranteed that your money will increase they\u2019re value.\n\nNumber 6. Don\u2019t try and reinvent the wheel, it\u2019s really hard to come up with something new in this era, you should just try and emulate and improve what you see other people are doing that make a lot of money. A great example is just creating YouTube videos, there are a lot of people making YouTube videos out there and earning money they couldn\u2019t have imagined. Or you can simply learn great skills that have high paying jobs, like coding or if that is to hard you should try and run Facebook or Google ads for companies or people, start small, get your local business to hire you, a lot of small business don\u2019t know how to get noticed on social media and may pay a lot of money to get more customers\n\nLet\u2019s move to number 7 on the list guys and that is: Don\u2019t buy new things. Guys I now we all want that brand new Lamborghini but let\u2019s face is\u2026 THE WORST, ABSOLUTELTY THE WORST MONEY YOU CAN EVENER Spend is on a brand new car. The value of that drops like a rock the second you drive it off the dealers lot. You should only buy used cars, you can get a lot more value for your money with a car that is just a few years old and even might get lucky and don\u2019t lose that much money if you buy curs that don\u2019t depreciate that quickly. Other things you shouldn\u2019t buy new that also demand a huge premium over they\u2019re value is jewelry but be aware you should still get the things appraised by a certified expert before you spend money on jewelry to avoid getting scammed. You can usually find pretty good deals on luxury jewelry at reputable pawn shop or eBay items that offered guarantees. Also one last thing you should never buy are pets\u2026 This will do two great things, one you save a lot of money when adopting a pet and two you will do a great thing for a pet that is looking for a nice welcoming home.\n\n[CAR DEPRECIATION](https://ibb.co/6Fd1Mc0) /\n\nNumber 8 on my first 10 tips on how you can make money right now is PAY OFF THAT HIGH INTEREST DEBT\n\nSo, one thing that can start making you money right now is paying high interest debt, I know I told you earlier to invest your money into the stock market ASAP but guys\u2026 that interest rate is killing you believe me. You should try and pay off that debt as fast as you can especially the Credit Card DEBT. Try to never, but never have debt on your credit card, as they have the highest interest rates on any kind of loans with even [EXCELLENT CREDIT](https://ibb.co/Yc5H9Y5) the lowest annual percentage rate is still 15% while it does depend from bank to bank with the Discover credit card having the lowest interest and Capital One having the highest at over 25%. After you pay this debt you should then focus on personal loans which have the second highest interest rate at about 10% followed by student loans and auto loans. The one debt you shouldn\u2019t necessarily try and pay of as fast as you can are long term fixed mortgages with interest rates being at all time low rates you should probably take advantage right now and refinance your old mortgage at a much lower APR. So my opinion is that if you have high interest rate loans like credit cards, and personal loans you should get rid of that ASAP I would pay off that debt with 80% of the money I can save every month and the rest of 20% I would invest in the stock market but in the case of lower interest rates you should take advantage by the leverage mortgages offer you and you should invest more in the stock market as the annual average return is much higher than your interest rate. [AVG LOAN RATES](https://ibb.co/TRZr5vm) / [CREDIT CARD RATES](https://ibb.co/3BCcvP3) / [LONG TERM LOANS RATES](https://ibb.co/Z8JsSdc)\n\nNumber 9 on the list is TRY NEW THINGS, if you haven\u2019t already found your niche, you should probably try as many new things as possible until you find the one that works for you. You should find that thing that you really enjoy and can also add a significant amount to your net worth, you shouldn\u2019t waste your time with jobs or businesses that you don\u2019t enjoy or don\u2019t have the potential to add big to your net worth\n\nAnd finally number 10. Invest in real estate and rent out.\n\nYou should go out and find good real estate deals, you should seek out houses that are undervalued in a nice neighbourhood. Don\u2019t seek houses that require a lot of work to restore, because if you don\u2019t know what you should really do you might end up overspending on the house. You should get leverage on the real estate with mortgage rates being so low right now. Also go out and find good renters as this will bring up a good steady cash flow as a passive income, this also gives you great tax advantages and is a hedge against inflation especially now with all this money being pumped in the world there is a risk of inflation in the future. There are a few cons for real estate investing the main one being that they require more work than just owning stocks but this is a great way to diversify your asset allocation. So, I believe that you should do both as your income allows you, you should try and buy more and more real estate and rent it out as this will make you control a lot of money with really small upfront costs but you should also keep investing in the stock market. You should try and find your own balance as this is highly depended from person to person [REAL ESTATE PRO/CONS](https://ibb.co/fxKjGNp) / [STOCKS vs REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/wQtCQZ4)\n\nHey guys, thank you for sticking this far and as a reward for sticking this far here is a bonus tip for you\n\nAs soon as you turn 18 you should try and get a credit card to build up your credit history. But be very careful don\u2019t go and spend all the money on the credit card and don\u2019t pay it off as this will negatively impact your history. You should try and own at least a couple of great credit cards that offer great benefits use them but as soon as you can pay that thing off every month so you can enjoy getting a great credit history that will help you later in life when you apply for bigger loans like mortgages.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

So my opinion is that if you have high interest rate loans like credit cards, and personal loans you should get rid of that ASAP I would pay off that debt with 80% of the money I can save every month and the rest of 20% I would invest in the stock market but in the case of lower interest rates you should take advantage by the leverage mortgages offer you and you should invest more in the stock market as the annual average return is much higher than your interest rate. [AVG LOAN RATES](https://ibb.co/TRZr5vm) / [CREDIT CARD RATES](https://ibb.co/3BCcvP3) / [LONG TERM LOANS RATES](https://ibb.co/Z8JsSdc)\n\nNumber 9 on the list is TRY NEW THINGS, if you haven\u2019t already found your niche, you should probably try as many new things as possible until you find the one that works for you. You should find that thing that you really enjoy and can also add a significant amount to your net worth, you shouldn\u2019t waste your time with jobs or businesses that you don\u2019t enjoy or don\u2019t have the potential to add big to your net worth\n\nAnd finally number 10. Invest in real estate and rent out.\n\nYou should go out and find good real estate deals, you should seek out houses that are undervalued in a nice neighbourhood. Don\u2019t seek houses that require a lot of work to restore, because if you don\u2019t know what you should really do you might end up overspending on the house. You should get leverage on the real estate with mortgage rates being so low right now. Also go out and find good renters as this will bring up a good steady cash flow as a passive income, this also gives you great tax advantages and is a hedge against inflation especially now with all this money being pumped in the world there is a risk of inflation in the future. There are a few cons for real estate investing the main one being that they require more work than just owning stocks but this is a great way to diversify your asset allocation. So, I believe that you should do both as your income allows you, you should try and buy more and more real estate and rent it out as this will make you control a lot of money with really small upfront costs but you should also keep investing in the stock market. You should try and find your own balance as this is highly depended from person to person [REAL ESTATE PRO/CONS](https://ibb.co/fxKjGNp) / [STOCKS vs REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/wQtCQZ4)\n\nHey guys, thank you for sticking this far and as a reward for sticking this far here is a bonus tip for you\n\nAs soon as you turn 18 you should try and get a credit card to build up your credit history. But be very careful don\u2019t go and spend all the money on the credit card and don\u2019t pay it off as this will negatively impact your history. You should try and own at least a couple of great credit cards that offer great benefits use them but as soon as you can pay that thing off every month so you can enjoy getting a great credit history that will help you later in life when you apply for bigger loans like mortgages.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

Start saving money and INVEST IT\n\nThe most important thing is START SAVING MONEY RIGHT NOW AND INVEST IT, don\u2019t spend it on useless things that don\u2019t add value to you. Either knowledge value, net worth value or future prospect value. This is one of the things that I learned the hard way, as I was spending all my money and never saving and investing it, this has cost me a lot of real money and potential money as I have missed out on a lot of things so be sure and learn from other people\u2019s mistakes\n\n2. Number two has a lot to do with number one TRACK YOUR SPENDING AND IMPROVE IT BY REDUCING EXPENSES\n\nYou think you are doing everything you can to start saving money? Well you probably aren\u2019t if you are looking at this post. Start tracking all of your expenses by using your credit or debit card for almost every purchase you do and at the end of every month take your time and look over your statements. Are you satisfied with what you see? Are all your expenses really worth it? Are they adding value for you or future value? Probably not\u2026 Are you enjoying 10$ coffees when you can make our own at home for 50 cents? Is that brand name clothing or perfume adding value to you? You can easily get really nice clothes and great smelling perfumes for a lot less when not buying brand names. Another good idea is not to do groceries while you are hungry as you are tempted to buy much more food that you don\u2019t actually need and end up wasting it. Do you really need to pay 5$ to play candy crush? I don\u2019t believe so, you can find tons of games for free but wait a minute, why play games when you should try and do something that adds value to your life? Are you buying lottery tickets? Stop that right now, take that money and invest it. This are just a few examples that can improve your spending habits. Take your time every month and track your expense, cut out the stuff you don\u2019t need and you will start feeling a difference very soon. \n\n3. The number 3 tip is Don\u2019t rush just HAVE PATIENCE. I know, you want Lamborghini money in a week with nothing to start from, Yeah, me too but that is not gonna happen. You must learn to have patience and grow your net worth steadily over time, don\u2019t go on Wall street bets and trade options thinking you\u2019ll get rich by next month, that is a recipe for disaster. You might get lucky 1 in 10 thousand times but there are far better ways of making money. So be patient and take your time.  [SCREENSHOT](https://ibb.co/Q6wyg5h)\n\nMoving up to number 4, INVEST IN STOCKS\n\nHere you can see that if you had invested 30 years ago in 1 share of the SP that money would be worth 10 times that amount right now and even adjusted for inflation you would still be up huge [30 years SP](https://ibb.co/47wkSQq). With the annualized Average Return of investment being more than 6% [AVG RETURNS](https://ibb.co/54NpNZQ). Here you can see that you should not try to time the market as it is really hard to predict what is the best time to buy, you should just get into the stock market, you shouldn\u2019t probably dump all your money in one day. But you should be buying into the stock market every time you get paid would be a great thing to do. As being fully invested in the stock market in the past 30 years has return more than 7% annually, while missing just the 3 best days of the stock market every year could see you end up losing money.  [BEING FULLY INVESTED](https://ibb.co/Jnx6vsF)\n\nDon\u2019t know how the stock market goes? No worries number 5 will help you. INVEST IN ETF\u2019s. What are ETFs? ETFs are exchanged traded funds that you can buy just like stocks. They are very similar to index funds but have lower fees usually and you can find ETFs that track pretty much everything. What are Index funds? Index funds are mutual fonds that are managed by professional money managers and represent a theoretical segment of the stock market with the most important ones being the SP500 that tracks the 500 biggest companies listed on the US stock exchange, the Nasdaq Composite which includes almost all the companies that are listed on the Nasdaq stock market or the Nasdaq 100 which includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies in the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/xhzzqSf) and the [DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/T1jhmr9) that tracks the stock performance of the 30 larges companies listed in the United States. They all have ETFs that track them, [QQQ](https://ibb.co/JkWYL76) tracks the Nasdaq and also has a dividend yield of 0,56%, [SPY](https://ibb.co/T45kYff) tracks the SP500 and has a dividend yield of 1,6% while [DIA](https://ibb.co/Vwt1nGN) tracks the Dow Jones and has a dividend yield just over 2%. but you can also invest in ETFs that track sectors like [SMH](https://ibb.co/m5vZML4) which tracks the semiconductor sector and still has a dividend yield of more than 1% more than almost any bank is giving right now on savings account and also offer growth. Or if you like the airlines and think that they will return to the value they once have there is a ETF for that also under the ticker [JETS](https://ibb.co/bJYnSrL) or if you like banks [XLF](https://ibb.co/WK4BYb0) is a good ETF for those and you can also invest in real estate with tracking a real estate ETF, one for example is [XLRE](https://ibb.co/TWhbMdC) , there are many ETFs that you can choose from not only these one. And as long as you consistently invest money over time, it is almost guaranteed that your money will increase they\u2019re value.\n\nNumber 6. Don\u2019t try and reinvent the wheel, it\u2019s really hard to come up with something new in this era, you should just try and emulate and improve what you see other people are doing that make a lot of money. A great example is just creating YouTube videos, there are a lot of people making YouTube videos out there and earning money they couldn\u2019t have imagined. Or you can simply learn great skills that have high paying jobs, like coding or if that is to hard you should try and run Facebook or Google ads for companies or people, start small, get your local business to hire you, a lot of small business don\u2019t know how to get noticed on social media and may pay a lot of money to get more customers\n\nLet\u2019s move to number 7 on the list guys and that is: Don\u2019t buy new things. Guys I now we all want that brand new Lamborghini but let\u2019s face is\u2026 THE WORST, ABSOLUTELTY THE WORST MONEY YOU CAN EVENER Spend is on a brand new car. The value of that drops like a rock the second you drive it off the dealers lot. You should only buy used cars, you can get a lot more value for your money with a car that is just a few years old and even might get lucky and don\u2019t lose that much money if you buy curs that don\u2019t depreciate that quickly. Other things you shouldn\u2019t buy new that also demand a huge premium over they\u2019re value is jewelry but be aware you should still get the things appraised by a certified expert before you spend money on jewelry to avoid getting scammed. You can usually find pretty good deals on luxury jewelry at reputable pawn shop or eBay items that offered guarantees. Also one last thing you should never buy are pets\u2026 This will do two great things, one you save a lot of money when adopting a pet and two you will do a great thing for a pet that is looking for a nice welcoming home.\n\n[CAR DEPRECIATION](https://ibb.co/6Fd1Mc0) / \n\nNumber 8 on my first 10 tips on how you can make money right now is PAY OFF THAT HIGH INTEREST DEBT\n\nSo, one thing that can start making you money right now is paying high interest debt, I know I told you earlier to invest your money into the stock market ASAP but guys\u2026 that interest rate is killing you believe me. You should try and pay off that debt as fast as you can especially the Credit Card DEBT. Try to never, but never have debt on your credit card, as they have the highest interest rates on any kind of loans with even [EXCELLENT CREDIT](https://ibb.co/Yc5H9Y5) the lowest annual percentage rate is still 15% while it does depend from bank to bank with the Discover credit card having the lowest interest and Capital One having the highest at over 25%. After you pay this debt you should then focus on personal loans which have the second highest interest rate at about 10% followed by student loans and auto loans. The one debt you shouldn\u2019t necessarily try and pay of as fast as you can are long term fixed mortgages with interest rates being at all time low rates you should probably take advantage right now and refinance your old mortgage at a much lower APR. So my opinion is that if you have high interest rate loans like credit cards, and personal loans you should get rid of that ASAP I would pay off that debt with 80% of the money I can save every month and the rest of 20% I would invest in the stock market but in the case of lower interest rates you should take advantage by the leverage mortgages offer you and you should invest more in the stock market as the annual average return is much higher than your interest rate.

You should only buy used cars, you can get a lot more value for your money with a car that is just a few years old and even might get lucky and don\u2019t lose that much money if you buy curs that don\u2019t depreciate that quickly. Other things you shouldn\u2019t buy new that also demand a huge premium over they\u2019re value is jewelry but be aware you should still get the things appraised by a certified expert before you spend money on jewelry to avoid getting scammed. You can usually find pretty good deals on luxury jewelry at reputable pawn shop or eBay items that offered guarantees. Also one last thing you should never buy are pets\u2026 This will do two great things, one you save a lot of money when adopting a pet and two you will do a great thing for a pet that is looking for a nice welcoming home.\n\n[CAR DEPRECIATION](https://ibb.co/6Fd1Mc0) / \n\nNumber 8 on my first 10 tips on how you can make money right now is PAY OFF THAT HIGH INTEREST DEBT\n\nSo, one thing that can start making you money right now is paying high interest debt, I know I told you earlier to invest your money into the stock market ASAP but guys\u2026 that interest rate is killing you believe me. You should try and pay off that debt as fast as you can especially the Credit Card DEBT. Try to never, but never have debt on your credit card, as they have the highest interest rates on any kind of loans with even [EXCELLENT CREDIT](https://ibb.co/Yc5H9Y5) the lowest annual percentage rate is still 15% while it does depend from bank to bank with the Discover credit card having the lowest interest and Capital One having the highest at over 25%. After you pay this debt you should then focus on personal loans which have the second highest interest rate at about 10% followed by student loans and auto loans. The one debt you shouldn\u2019t necessarily try and pay of as fast as you can are long term fixed mortgages with interest rates being at all time low rates you should probably take advantage right now and refinance your old mortgage at a much lower APR. So my opinion is that if you have high interest rate loans like credit cards, and personal loans you should get rid of that ASAP I would pay off that debt with 80% of the money I can save every month and the rest of 20% I would invest in the stock market but in the case of lower interest rates you should take advantage by the leverage mortgages offer you and you should invest more in the stock market as the annual average return is much higher than your interest rate. [AVG LOAN RATES](https://ibb.co/TRZr5vm) / [CREDIT CARD RATES](https://ibb.co/3BCcvP3) / [LONG TERM LOANS RATES](https://ibb.co/Z8JsSdc)\n\nNumber 9 on the list is TRY NEW THINGS, if you haven\u2019t already found your niche, you should probably try as many new things as possible until you find the one that works for you. You should find that thing that you really enjoy and can also add a significant amount to your net worth, you shouldn\u2019t waste your time with jobs or businesses that you don\u2019t enjoy or don\u2019t have the potential to add big to your net worth\n\nAnd finally number 10. Invest in real estate and rent out.\n\nYou should go out and find good real estate deals, you should seek out houses that are undervalued in a nice neighbourhood. Don\u2019t seek houses that require a lot of work to restore, because if you don\u2019t know what you should really do you might end up overspending on the house. You should get leverage on the real estate with mortgage rates being so low right now. Also go out and find good renters as this will bring up a good steady cash flow as a passive income, this also gives you great tax advantages and is a hedge against inflation especially now with all this money being pumped in the world there is a risk of inflation in the future. There are a few cons for real estate investing the main one being that they require more work than just owning stocks but this is a great way to diversify your asset allocation. So, I believe that you should do both as your income allows you, you should try and buy more and more real estate and rent it out as this will make you control a lot of money with really small upfront costs but you should also keep investing in the stock market. You should try and find your own balance as this is highly depended from person to person [REAL ESTATE PRO/CONS](https://ibb.co/fxKjGNp) / [STOCKS vs REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/wQtCQZ4)\n\nHey guys, thank you for sticking this far and as a reward for sticking this far here is a bonus tip for you\n\nAs soon as you turn 18 you should try and get a credit card to build up your credit history. But be very careful don\u2019t go and spend all the money on the credit card and don\u2019t pay it off as this will negatively impact your history. You should try and own at least a couple of great credit cards that offer great benefits use them but as soon as you can pay that thing off every month so you can enjoy getting a great credit history that will help you later in life when you apply for bigger loans like mortgages.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the contente!\n\nBe sure to leave a comment down below with your expectations on the stock market! \n\nHave a great day and see you next time!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler":

The new Macs seem to have huge improvements in performance and battery life. This will likely be a boost to the addressable market of the Macs as they will address the people who need big performance in they\u2019re computers as well as people who are looking for good cheap computer as the new Mac Mini desktop is 100$ cheaper than the previous version. This will be a more than 15 billion addressable market for Apple as they continue to improve products and services all the time.

[BOEING CONTRACT](https://ibb.co/6vRFGjF)\n\nAlibaba just announced that orders made on its e-commerce platform during the Singles Day event have exceeded 56 billion $ by today as consumers are still splashing out money on buying products online. Singles day is the world\u2019s biggest sales event eclipsing both Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the US combined as it stretches over 4 main days this year. They have received more than 16 times the orders that Amazon received last month in its two-day Prime event. This are finally some good news for the company as it has lost almost 76 billion $ of it\u2019s market value after the suspension of Ant Group IPO which they own about a third of. I believe this will be a great opportunity to buy the stocks as it is way down from its highs. Ant Group will eventually file and have they\u2019re IPO in the next year which will boost the stock up once again even if it will be at a much lower valuation for the company.

Yeesh, what was wrong with Wednesday? The surface-level news was that all five\u2014Apple \ufffc, Amazon.com \ufffc, Alphabet \ufffc, Facebook \ufffc, and Twitter \ufffc\u2014beat expectations for both sales and profits. But there were more revealing details to be found beneath the headlines.\n\nWaiting for 5G: Let\u2019s start with Apple (ticker: AAPL), still the largest company on Earth by market capitalization, but now worth less than $2 trillion as its shares have fallen 20% from their 2000 high. This was an awkward quarter for Apple. Investors are buzzed about the new iPhone 12 line, but the phones have just started shipping, and weren\u2019t available in the September quarter. Apple CEO Tim Cook said iPhone sales in the quarter beat internal expectations, but they were a little shy of Wall Street consensus estimates. Worrisome was a sharp drop in sales in \u201cGreater China.\u201d They fell 29% from a year ago. The apparent issue: China is ahead of the U.S. on 5G, and other phone makers already have 5G phones on the market. Would you buy a 4G phone now? Didn\u2019t think so.\n\nApple didn\u2019t give formal guidance, but it gave some solid hints. It expects iPhone sales to rise year over year, despite the late start for the new iPhones, with double-digit revenue growth for every other hardware line and services. Apple also expects a return to growth in China. And, by the way: Macs, iPads, and Wearables together generated almost $24 billion in sales in the quarter, up a combined 30% year over year. On a run-rate basis, Apple\u2019s non-iPhone hardware this quarter will surpass $100 billion. Services is approaching $60 billion. Apple bought back $18 billion of stock in the quarter. Stop worrying; Apple will be fine.\n\nShop! In the Name of Love: U.S. online holiday shopping is expected to grow 33% this year to $189 billion, according to a report last week from Adobe Systems \ufffc, based on data gathered from 80 of the 100 largest online retailers. Amazon (AMZN) didn\u2019t need to read that report. The e-commerce giant posted 39% sales growth in North America in the September quarter. But profit-margin guidance for the fourth quarter gave investors pause: Amazon expects to have $4 billion in Covid-related costs in the quarter, up from $2.5 billion in the third quarter. Also, this year Prime Day fell in the fourth quarter; Amazon notes that those aren\u2019t the company\u2019s highest-margin sales. But let\u2019s not forget that Amazon crushed operating-income guidance for the September quarter. It wouldn\u2019t be shocking if it did it again. Amazon vowed last week to hire 100,000 temporary workers for the holidays. No company has benefited more from the acceleration in online shopping.\n\nBuy Stuff Now! Online-ad platforms are also benefiting from the e-commerce surge. Amazon had \u201cother revenue\u201d\u2014mostly ads\u2014of $5.4 billion in the quarter, up 50%. eBay \ufffc\u2019s [EBAY] ad revenue rose 77% in the period. Snap \ufffc [SNAP] and Pinterest \ufffc [PINS] recently posted ad-driven earnings beats, spurring huge stock moves. So it was no surprise that both Alphabet [GOOGL] and Facebook [FB] blew away top-line estimates. Remember the Facebook ad boycott? Heh. It\u2019s not working. Google parent Alphabet has been the megacap laggard this year, with a gain of under 20%, but it was the star Thursday. YouTube alone had $5 billion in ad sales, up 32%. And then there\u2019s Google Cloud.\n\nIn Clouds We Trust: All that hype about the public cloud? It\u2019s understated. Microsoft \ufffc [MSFT] said its commercial cloud business was up 31% in the September quarter\u2014and Azure was up 48%. Amazon Web Services revenue rose 29%; Google Cloud\u2019s jumped 45%. The German enterprise-software giant SAP \ufffc [SAP] slashed its revenue outlook this past week, declaring itself determined to accelerate its cloud transition, and the stock lost more than a quarter of its value. There is a lack of pure plays on the public cloud. You could do worse than owning a basket of Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nDeciphering Jeff: A standard part of every earnings press release is the CEO quote. Usually the boss waxes poetic about the quarter, or raves about the company\u2019s engineers or huge addressable market. Amazon\u2019s release this quarter quotes CEO Jeff Bezos saying that retailers everywhere should match the company\u2019s $15-an-hour minimum-wage rate: \u201cWe hope other large employers will also make the jump to $15. Now would be a great time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a strange quote for an earnings release. A PR move to show Amazon is a solid corporate citizen? An attempt to embarrass lower-paying rivals? It\u2019s weird.\n\nMerlin\u2019s Beard! The loser on Tech Trillions Thursday was Twitter [TWTR]. Earlier in the week, CEO Jack Dorsey was grilled by Senate Republicans who think social networks censor conservative political content. Dorsey appeared on screen for the virtual hearing with a long beard\u2014a little bit Confucius, a little ZZ Top. Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) accused Dorsey of being a pawn of the left, but the senator is worrying about the wrong platform. Twitter added just one million daily average users in the quarter, well below expectations. It has under 200 million users. Facebook\u2019s platforms have a combined 2.5 billion daily actives\u2014about a third of the world\u2019s population. There\u2019s a reason Twitter\u2019s valuation is just 5% of Facebook\u2019s.

Yeesh, what was wrong with Wednesday? The surface-level news was that all five\u2014Apple \ufffc, Amazon.com \ufffc, Alphabet \ufffc, Facebook \ufffc, and Twitter \ufffc\u2014beat expectations for both sales and profits. But there were more revealing details to be found beneath the headlines.\n\nWaiting for 5G: Let\u2019s start with Apple (ticker: AAPL), still the largest company on Earth by market capitalization, but now worth less than $2 trillion as its shares have fallen 20% from their 2000 high. This was an awkward quarter for Apple. Investors are buzzed about the new iPhone 12 line, but the phones have just started shipping, and weren\u2019t available in the September quarter. Apple CEO Tim Cook said iPhone sales in the quarter beat internal expectations, but they were a little shy of Wall Street consensus estimates. Worrisome was a sharp drop in sales in \u201cGreater China.\u201d They fell 29% from a year ago. The apparent issue: China is ahead of the U.S. on 5G, and other phone makers already have 5G phones on the market. Would you buy a 4G phone now? Didn\u2019t think so.\n\nApple didn\u2019t give formal guidance, but it gave some solid hints. It expects iPhone sales to rise year over year, despite the late start for the new iPhones, with double-digit revenue growth for every other hardware line and services. Apple also expects a return to growth in China. And, by the way: Macs, iPads, and Wearables together generated almost $24 billion in sales in the quarter, up a combined 30% year over year. On a run-rate basis, Apple\u2019s non-iPhone hardware this quarter will surpass $100 billion. Services is approaching $60 billion. Apple bought back $18 billion of stock in the quarter. Stop worrying; Apple will be fine.\n\nShop! In the Name of Love: U.S. online holiday shopping is expected to grow 33% this year to $189 billion, according to a report last week from Adobe Systems \ufffc, based on data gathered from 80 of the 100 largest online retailers. Amazon (AMZN) didn\u2019t need to read that report. The e-commerce giant posted 39% sales growth in North America in the September quarter. But profit-margin guidance for the fourth quarter gave investors pause: Amazon expects to have $4 billion in Covid-related costs in the quarter, up from $2.5 billion in the third quarter. Also, this year Prime Day fell in the fourth quarter; Amazon notes that those aren\u2019t the company\u2019s highest-margin sales. But let\u2019s not forget that Amazon crushed operating-income guidance for the September quarter. It wouldn\u2019t be shocking if it did it again. Amazon vowed last week to hire 100,000 temporary workers for the holidays. No company has benefited more from the acceleration in online shopping.\n\nBuy Stuff Now! Online-ad platforms are also benefiting from the e-commerce surge. Amazon had \u201cother revenue\u201d\u2014mostly ads\u2014of $5.4 billion in the quarter, up 50%. eBay \ufffc\u2019s [EBAY] ad revenue rose 77% in the period. Snap \ufffc [SNAP] and Pinterest \ufffc [PINS] recently posted ad-driven earnings beats, spurring huge stock moves. So it was no surprise that both Alphabet [GOOGL] and Facebook [FB] blew away top-line estimates. Remember the Facebook ad boycott? Heh. It\u2019s not working. Google parent Alphabet has been the megacap laggard this year, with a gain of under 20%, but it was the star Thursday. YouTube alone had $5 billion in ad sales, up 32%. And then there\u2019s Google Cloud.\n\nIn Clouds We Trust: All that hype about the public cloud? It\u2019s understated. Microsoft \ufffc [MSFT] said its commercial cloud business was up 31% in the September quarter\u2014and Azure was up 48%. Amazon Web Services revenue rose 29%; Google Cloud\u2019s jumped 45%. The German enterprise-software giant SAP \ufffc [SAP] slashed its revenue outlook this past week, declaring itself determined to accelerate its cloud transition, and the stock lost more than a quarter of its value. There is a lack of pure plays on the public cloud. You could do worse than owning a basket of Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nDeciphering Jeff: A standard part of every earnings press release is the CEO quote. Usually the boss waxes poetic about the quarter, or raves about the company\u2019s engineers or huge addressable market. Amazon\u2019s release this quarter quotes CEO Jeff Bezos saying that retailers everywhere should match the company\u2019s $15-an-hour minimum-wage rate: \u201cWe hope other large employers will also make the jump to $15. Now would be a great time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a strange quote for an earnings release. A PR move to show Amazon is a solid corporate citizen? An attempt to embarrass lower-paying rivals? It\u2019s weird.\n\nMerlin\u2019s Beard! The loser on Tech Trillions Thursday was Twitter [TWTR]. Earlier in the week, CEO Jack Dorsey was grilled by Senate Republicans who think social networks censor conservative political content. Dorsey appeared on screen for the virtual hearing with a long beard\u2014a little bit Confucius, a little ZZ Top. Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) accused Dorsey of being a pawn of the left, but the senator is worrying about the wrong platform. Twitter added just one million daily average users in the quarter, well below expectations. It has under 200 million users. Facebook\u2019s platforms have a combined 2.5 billion daily actives\u2014about a third of the world\u2019s population. There\u2019s a reason Twitter\u2019s valuation is just 5% of Facebook\u2019s. Don\u2019t forget to vote.\n\nSource: Barron's", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 893316, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "5 Tech Titans Just Posted Earnings.

Communications services and tech rallying into big tech results after the close. Healthcare, utilities and financials the decliners. Treasuries narrowly mixed. Dollar better vs major currencies. Gold down 0.2%. WTI crude down 4.4%, hitting lowest levels since June.\n* Nothing specific behind the choppy price action as the market narrative remains largely unchanged. **Biggest concerns right now revolve around resurgent coronavirus cases and accompanying mitigation measures, vaccine delays, lack of near-term fiscal stimulus and potential for a contested election**. Some of these concerns have helped to overshadow strong Q3 earnings season metrics though there have also been thoughts that a lot of good news has already been priced in. Central bank liquidity tailwind still seen as the biggest positive for stocks. Corporate profit resilience another key part of the bullish narrative. Strategists have also discussed how the market has warmed up to prospects for meaningful fiscal stimulus if Democrats sweep.\n* **Initial claims** better than expected, hitting lowest level since mid-March. **Q3 GDP** expanded a slightly larger-than-expected 33.1% but best quarter on record followed worst quarter of all time. **ECB** left policy unchanged but hinted it could recalibrate in December. **Coronavirus** **headlines downbea**t following European lockdowns yesterday with record cases in US, more concerns about hospital capacity pressures, and Fauci saying US may not return to normal until 2022.

Nothing too surprising from a thematic perspective with **companies leveraged to at-home trends (work, watch, listen, eat) still reporting some of the best results**. Auto and housing exposure also bright spots. Travel and cross-border exposure still a headwind. Cost-cutting still a big area of focus from a margin perspective. **Factors such as expectations and sustainability also playing a role in the post-earnings price action**.\n* In terms of some of the higher-profile earnings, **V-US** results better than rival MA-US with help from debit and US exposure. **AMGN-US** guidance raise seemed to underwhelm. **NOW-US** subscription revenue and billings beat and management commentary positive. **SPOT-US** revenue (and guide) light but sub and engagement metrics better. **EBAY-US** beat but GMV growth slowed and active users missed. **PINS-US** beat big and guided above on leverage to at-home trends. **KHC-US** boosted by at-home consumption tailwind.

China\u2019s stocks, is up 18% this year, compared with 6% for the S&amp;P 500 index.\n\nShares of Alibaba Group Holding (BABA), one of China\u2019s most important companies, are up 36% this year.

Many Chinese stocks, notably Alibaba, held up.\n\nHedging U.S. portfolios with Chinese stocks, particularly Alibaba, might seem outlandish, but Susquehanna Investment Group, a top options-trading firm that seeks out noncorrelated U.S. equity investments, has significant China exposure. The secretive trading company owns a huge piece of ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, that could be worth more than $15 billion. The investment would probably dwarf anything the firm\u2019s partners have ever realized in a long history of extraordinary success.\n\nAlibaba will never protect a portfolio the way traditional hedges, such as S&amp;P 500 options, do, but Alibaba\u2019s options premiums and stock price aren\u2019t as distorted ahead of the bizarre U.S. presidential election. Trading volumes on the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, are stunningly anemic during the oddest trading year since the 2008-09 financial crisis, suggesting that investors have little faith that VIX derivatives will work as expected.\n\nBut adding China exposure, especially Alibaba, to a portfolio offers hedging through diversification.\n\nAlibaba will hold its annual Singles Day event on Nov. 11. For 24 hours, Alibaba will host an online sale and celebration that makes Amazon.com\u2019s (AMZN) Prime Day seem like a Rotary Club luncheon.

This year\u2019s event will indicate how much Asian consumers have recovered from the coronavirus. Powerful sales results will intrigue investors who are worried about the sclerotic U.S. and European economies and concerned about political mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith Alibaba\u2019s stock at $296.50, investors can sell Alibaba\u2019s November $295 put for $18.20 and buy Alibaba\u2019s November $300 call for $17.60. The trade generates a credit of 60 cents. If Alibaba\u2019s stock is at $310 at expiration, the call is worth $10.

It's simply about covered calls and cash secured puts. \n\nTo give you some context, I've been working with my father since September, when we started running this strategy. I've also done it with my own money and realized some things about the capital requirements to be successful writing options. My dad started with about $170,000, and I started with about $45,000. I've dabbled, but I'm now leaning toward going long with about 80% of my money. This will fluctuate, but I think it's best to start with at least $100,000 if you're going to run this strategy, and that should only be no more than 40% of your portfolio if you want to be aggressive. \n\nMisconceptions: \n\n1. **Writing options is risky:** Wrong. It's literally no different than going long. Instead, you're just also collecting a premium for your troubles. The only risk here is singling out certain tickers that might not recover for some time. Hence the reason you need $100k or more: to be able to diversify your positions enough that you're not bagholding on the majority of them. \n2. **Avoid volatile stocks:** My god, this one is the most ridiculous of them all. The only reason--and I mean ONLY REASON--that you would avoid volatile tickers is because you're emotional. Volatile stocks pay higher premiums. Volatile stocks allow you to write on them at big discounts. Volatile stocks might run up before you sell the call, or allow you to collect decent premiums at higher strikes. I've seen people list stocks like Apple, NVDA, Facebook, AMD and Netflix as stocks to avoid when writing options. These are literally the very stocks that made us the most money. Volatility means absolutely nothing if the companies are good, and these companies are much more than good. \n3. **What if the market tanks:** Okay? So...what? People cite some quote about picking up pennies on a train track, when that was attributed to naked options. If you're long anyway, then you're in no different position. I have absolutely no idea why this is cited as a reason to avoid writing options. This, mathematically, makes absolutely no sense, and you cannot prove me wrong. \n4. **Long dated options:** Stop. Just stop. If you're not writing weeklies, you have no idea what you're doing. Again, math: the premiums are higher (yes, they are higher, do the math); you can better aim your strikes; and you don't have to sit there for months on end biting your nails as the market does what it does. \n5. **The object is to make as much premium as possible without my shares being assigned:** Huh? This isn't a long strategy. This is an options strategy; the whole idea is to make outsized weekly gains, between 1-4%. Any capital gains are bonus (though they can be big as well in certain cases). If you're trying to juggle going long with an options strategy, you're just caught in no-man's land. \n6. **Writing options is a neutral to bearish strategy:** Again, why would you listen to your brokerage's tutorial on options trading? Writing calls and puts works in literally any market, except for a crash, in which the only good strategy is shorting, and good luck to you on that one. \n7. **Avoid writing on stocks reporting earnings:** Huh? Again, emotions over logic. Why do I care if my shares get called away because Apple mooned at earnings? If I'm making 3-4% on premium--IN ONE WEEK--why am I getting the FOMOs? Why are you dumping Amazon because it fell 4% after earnings? Why aren't you instead selling another call at the price you bought? Stop shooting yourself in the foot. \n8. **You will miss out on dividends:** This might be the dumbest of them all. When I'm collecting 1-4% weekly, do you think I give two \\*hits about dividends? We once executed a  daily SPY put at near the market bottom in March that netted over 500% annualized. And you're bringing up *dividends*? \n9. **Taxes:** So you have to pay taxes on money you make. Would you rather not make money? Okay then what are we talking about? Also, you can use your IRA if you have enough in there. Enough said. \n\nHere's a brief overview of the strategy. You pick stocks you really like, and then you check earnings each week. Do a good balance of quality stocks and quality stocks reporting earnings, since the premiums are huge. \n\n1. You sell WEEKLY ATM calls or cash secured puts. If you're a little twitchy about the market, sell puts a little further out of the money. Let's say you sell 15 contracts. Two of them dip. You've made 3-4% in a week, so just sell cheaper calls at a strike equal to the cost of the shares. Now you can do it all over again with the shares that got assigned (or didn't if the price was flat or you sold a put). You might make slightly less this week, but with the constant gains, 1-4% per week is going to constantly increase.\n2. Now, for the stocks that you're stuck with, get creative--but be PATIENT. I recently wrote a put on BAC at 28.50. Not my best move, but now I'm waiting, looking to sell longer dated calls. \"Wait, but you just told us to do weeklies.\" With the stocks that are down, not necessarily. That's the beauty of the strategy. If you go long on BAC at 28.50 and don't sell anything, you're shit out of luck until it recovers. At least you can sell a call. Every day I look at what a 28 call with a month to expiration would net me. \"Wait, but you said to write only at the price you bought it at.\" Well, I've already made $50 on the stock, and plus, I don't think it's going to fully recover in a month. Now it's at 26.11, and I can start looking at decent premiums. If they get taken away, fine, I broke even on that one. But for every time that happens, far more often I'll be down on a stock for long enough that I sell enough calls to still make a decent 1-30% annualized profit by the time it's called away. \n3. As for choosing stocks, go with what's good. It's as simple as that. Would you buy Apple? Starbucks? eBay? Verizon? Great, then if it's a good time, such as earnings season or the stock is at a discount, go ahead with it. I like to look at the 52 week highs. It's great to buy stocks at a discount, ESPECIALLY when you've written on that stock before. I can't tell you how many contracts we've written on Apple. It's near a thousand by now. Same with NVDA and Netflix. We're aggressive, because we're emotionless. As I said before, volatility means absolutely nothing when writing options. It's your emotions. If NVDA drops 20%, fine, I don't care. It's a great stock, and at least I collected a premium. I'd happily go long NVDA, and in that case I wouldn't be making anything. I can't tell you how many times we've bought these stocks at discounts because you fools make the price fluctuate. Probably 30% of our profits are riding stocks back up and past where they were, then writing on them again when they fall again.   \nAs for choosing stocks with earnings coming out, the rules are no different; don't write a put on Nikola because the premiums are fat. I.e. don't be an idiot. But it's also about the price. My worst move ever was writing a put on WORK before the past earnings release. I like Slack, it's early but I think they're doing big things. But I sold the put during a run-up prior to earnings. Stupid. Now I'm holding the bag. HOWEVER, as proof of how great this strat is, though I sold the put at 38 strike, I'm writing long dated calls at 32. Why? Because I've already made over $600 writing on that stock. I literally can't lose. Same with Marriott. I wrote so many puts that, after writing one at 111, I could write at less than 90 and still come out even. I won't, because I know it's going to pump after the vaccine announcement, and it's still incredibly undervalued, but again, just another example of how even the losers turn out to be winners if you just run the numbers.\n4. Speaking of running the numbers, it all comes down to math. You write down the price you bought at and/or the strike you sold at. You write down the premium. Then you write down the profit and add to the premium (the difference between the price you bought and the call strike). Recently, I wrote a TMUS put at 108 prior to earnings. It pumped to 116 after--but I made $275. Do you think I give a poop what I 'missed out on' when I just made over 2.5% in one week? Multiple that by 52 weeks and what do you get? And yes, this is consistently reached. Last week we made nearly $8,000. Last month--over $30,000. \n\nMy father and I worked on a $170,000 account starting in late September of 2019. That was only about 15-20% of his portfolio, so he has a lot more than me obviously. It's now almost at 500k. In less than 10 months. This isn't a joke. People laugh at us, tell us we're lying. Could care less. Money is pouring out of our eyeballs. We did this before we even got TDA to let us sell cash secured puts (you have to ask, which is dumb). Once that started, late March was just a deluge of cash. SPY dailies were hundreds of percent annualized. \n\nI wrote this post because I'm thinking about writing a book on this strategy. It's hard though because a) people need to not believe you when you've found out how to do something that's been in front of their face the entire time, and b) as I said, a lot of it is about temperament. If you're the type that would've sold everything in March just because it was bottoming out, you shouldn't even be in the market in the first place. But more so, if you can't handle volatility, uncertainty, and can't be faithful to a plan and trust that the same things that have happened in the market since its inception will continue to happen--i.e. stocks will rise and fall, but mainly they will rise--then you can't execute this strategy. \n\nIf you fall into either camp, a) or b), I couldn't care less. If you don't believe me or need to ridicule me because it helps you feel better about your assumptions, I will still have all of the money we've made. But I'm trying desperately to tell people about this, because I do think it can help give people an opportunity to get a little more out of their portfolio, add some aggressive growth to balance out the long term gains. \n\nOne final note. I started with $45,500 this year, and am now up to about $62,000. I've added a couple grand from work, but other than that, it's just gains. However, most of that is just the investment choices I made. I can't stress enough that this strategy requires a large amount of capital. $100,000 really is a baseline, and even then I think you're a little less flexible than you ought to be. You need to be able to ride out four or five stocks that have dipped, so that you can still write ten or twenty new contracts every week and maintain the cash flow stream. I've pretty much reduced my options strategy for my account to one or two stocks a week. In fact, I might just go back to focusing solely on my dad's account until I have a lot more money to play with. \n\nOkay all, that's my bit. I needed to get that off my chest because I'm really sick of people spreading lies, myths, and generally not understanding the power of this strategy. More than that, I'm sick of the people who refuse to believe me, as if I need to make up some lie about my investing prowess on reddit. I wouldn't be the first to do that, but it's beside the point; it boggles my mind how many people will deny themselves success solely to console their ego.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/here-comes-one-of-the-newsiest-and-most-critical-weeks-of-the-summer-for-markets.html)**\n*****\n&gt; In a summer of unending news, we may be heading into what could be the newsiest week of all.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq\u2019s sputtering rally could be put to its biggest test yet, as tech bellwether Apple and other stalwarts of the tech rally report earnings. Early in the week, Republicans will unveil their stimulus package proposal, which will then be debated as Friday\u2019s deadline nears for the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve also meets on and is likely to discuss other steps it can take. It\u2019s not likely, however, to make any moves as it wraps up on Wednesday, other than to assure markets it will continue to use extraordinary programs to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Then on Thursday, the government will release a big number many investors have been dreading \u2014 the first official reading of second quarter gross domestic product, which which should show how hard the economy crashed when it was abruptly shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a contraction of about 35% in the second quarter, followed by a bounce back in the third quarter. But the size of that comeback could be directly impacted by how much stimulus Congress gives the economy, and how much the coronavirus continues to impact businesses and economic activity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s a clear understanding of how much the economy has leaned on the crutch of government stimulus, both fiscally and monetarily,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cEveryone will be watching for what will replace the $600 a week, and that will be the most important component of whatever plan they come up with.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The $600 weekly payment to about 30 million unemployed Americans expires Friday, and it is unlikely Congress will have a plan before that date. Strategists expect the amount to be cut in half, and Boockvar said the amount of that payment will directly impact the size of the boost to the economy\n*****\n&gt; The stimulus and tech earnings could both be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat the package looks like will be a huge deal, particularly on the unemployment benefits side, and whether tech companies can exceed the bar,\u201d said Boockvar. \u201cThat\u2019s very hard for them right now. So if they miss, does that mean it\u2019s going to be a negative for tech and not the whole market? Are we going to keep rotating to value from growth because tech has been so dominant it could take everything down?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to decline by 40.3% for the second quarter, based on the results of companies that have already reported and estimates, according to Refinifiv\u2019s I/B/E/S. Technology earnings are expected to have one of the smallest profit declines, at just 4.4% on average.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, which had rallied to record highs this summer, ended lower for a second week, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings numbers overall, they\u2019ve been pretty good. It\u2019s just the basic problem with the stock market right now is that valuations are still pretty high,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cOther parts of the market that maybe look cheap on a price-to-book basis, their earnings have been hit. In the case of certain retailers, airlines, you have to worry about when their business is going to come back, if ever.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 80% of the companies already reporting have beaten Wall Street estimates. That is well above the average beat rate of about 65%, since 1994.\n*****\n&gt; Dozens of major companies report in the coming week, including Facebook on Wednesday and Alphabet and Amazon on Thursday. Pharmaceuticals Merck, Pfizer and Eli Lilly are expected to report, and consumer products names Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and Procter &amp; Gamble also release results. Big oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron report Friday.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus from Congress and the Fed\n&gt; Strategists expect Congress to ultimately adopt a new stimulus package of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, but after the GOP plan is introduced it will have to be squared with Democrats\u2019 proposals. The House has its own $3 trillion spending plan. It is unlikely an agreement can be approved before unemployment benefits expire Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBipartisan negotiations between the White House, House, and Senate are officially underway, but we expect brinkmanship before passage. Trump administration officials also diverge on their expectations on timing, which remains optimistically by the end of July, and possibly stretching into August under the more \u2018realistic\u2019 case,\u201d writes Ed Mills, policy strategist at Raymond James.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills expects the $600 weekly payment to be cut to $300 or $400, and he said it\u2019s possible there would be more funds given to a Payroll Protection Program, to help small businesses.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOverall, momentum is building for the next package and the final price tag is arguably moving up (closer to $1.5 -2 trillion),\u201d Mills noted. Congress has already allocated $2.4 trillion in prior spending.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed will be discussing its own stimulus, and some economists expect it could again be talking about new tactics to keep interest rates low. One idea is a policy of forward guidance, where the Fed would steer market expectations more explicitly. Another is the Fed would use targeted Treasury purchases to control specific interest rates. But no new programs are expected to be announced.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey pretty much told us, they\u2019re all in. They told us they\u2019re willing to do whatever else it takes,\u201d said Keon. \u201cThe Fed is not going to be our problem. The Fed just told us they\u2019re going to do anything they can do to soften the blow from the virus.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/rshk3gVX/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/y6nsD6FQ/marketdata3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/nrVx3NtG/finvizfuts1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/NLhf0Rdn/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/gJmb01rb/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/vBhFxX6g/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Jn6YWFkq/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/85PX9Gjc/maketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/fRgk0Fb6/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C57tdKXj/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/HknGcQpj/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FsD5HPX2/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/Nfgvt3S6/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week\n\n&gt; The earnings slate continues to ramp up next week with 712 total companies scheduled to report. In the table below, we show the largest stocks by market cap that are set to report quarterly results. On Monday, there will be no company with a market cap above $100 billion reporting with the largest companies being Alexandria Real Estate (ARE) and multiple banks. On Tuesday, payment processor Visa (V) will be out with earnings in addition to Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN), McDonald's (MCD), and Raytheon (RTX). Visa has historically averaged the strongest stock price reaction to earnings of these names but it has gapped down for six straight quarters. That will be followed by another payment processor, Paypal (PYPL) on Wednesday. In addition to Paypal, Facebook (FB) is also scheduled to report that same day. While both stocks have averaged over 2% gains on earnings days historically, ServiceNow (NOW) has seen an even stronger performance with an average gain of 3.64%. Another major earnings report that will be widely watched is Boeing (BA) to get a gauge on how demolished travel demand has affected the company. On Thursday, three of the world's largest stocks will also be out with earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG). Each one has averaged a 1%+ gain on earnings days. Apple (AAPL) has seen some of the strongest results in recent history with last quarter snapping a streak of four consecutive triple plays. On Friday, two of the largest energy stocks, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), will round out the week and July's earning calendar. Both stocks have historically averaged declines on earnings days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/Earn3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dollar Weakness May Continue\n\n&gt; The US dollar was remarkably strong during the first quarter of 2020, benefitting from the flight to safety and rallying to nearly a 10% year-to-date gain at the stock market\u2019s low point on March 23. However, as equity markets have recovered, and the US has continued to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the dollar has given up nearly all of those gains. We think this trend may continue, and if so, it would have important implications for a range of asset classes.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a more diversified basket than the commonly cited DXY Index, is nearing a critical uptrend line. A break of this support could mean that weakness seen over the past few months is more than just an unwinding of the flight to safety. Through Wednesday, the index was down more than 1% for the week and tracking toward its fourth straight weekly loss.\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t just a technical story though. As we explored last month, rising twin deficits have historically been followed by a weaker dollar, meaning the fundamentals support this move as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/July-23-picture.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The commodity rally is another reason to believe the market may be looking toward a weaker dollar. Commodities are typically viewed as having an inverse relationship with the dollar since the dollar is effectively the denominator of a hard asset. Gold prices are up more than 20% year to date, copper just traded to its highest level in more than two years, and silver prices have appreciated 28% this month alone.\n\n&gt; As for the implications of a weaker dollar, according to LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201ca weaker US dollar may be a slight negative for US consumers\u2019 buying power, but for investors\u2019 portfolios the implications are overwhelmingly positive. Commodities are rallying, US multinational companies benefit from foreign buyers being able to afford more of their goods, and international stocks do well as their underlying currencies appreciate.\u201d\n\n&gt; Recent history bears this out. The last calendar year that saw a significant dollar decline was 2017 when the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell more than 8%. The S&amp;P 500 Index rallied more than 19% on a price return basis; however, international stocks fared even better. The MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 22% and 34%, respectively, and 2017 represented the only year since 2012 that either outperformed the US.\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Gets the Gold for YTD Performance\n\n&gt; In last night's Closer, we took a look at the massive rallies of late in the precious metals space. Gold (GLD) reached its highest level since 2011, but silver's (SLV) performance on the day was even more of a sight to behold with gains in the top 1% of all days since SLV began trading in 2006. Silver (SLV) rose 6.15% for its best day since March 24th when the metal rose 7.96%. Whereas the silver to gold ratio has been in a constant downtrend over the past decade (indicating underperformance of silver relative to gold), yesterday's big gains led to a breakout of this downtrend. With SLV trading higher by over 5% yet again this morning, that downtrend is being broken even more significantly, and that is even with SLV off the pre-market highs above $21.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; As recently as the final days of June, SLV was actually sitting on a loss year to date. That was a far cry from the performance of some of the best-performing assets of the year at the time like the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) which was up over 14% and the long term Treasuries ETF (TLT) which was up over 21.5%. Silver's yellow cousin, gold, was likewise sitting on a sizeable gain of 16.6%. Pivot ahead to today and the picture is very different. Around this morning's premarket highs when SLV was trading above $21, it actually topped QQQ, TLT, and GLD as the best performing asset in 2020. That is even with each of these other ETFs also trading higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys\n\n&gt; Despite persistent pandemic setbacks, bleak economic and corporate numbers, geopolitical tensions, civic unrest and a knock-down, drag-out election battle, the U.S. stock market has proven rather resilient. After suffering the shortest bear market in history that lasted only 40 days the velocity and strength of the V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low has been impressive.\n\n&gt; Massive fiscal stimulus, the return of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), vaccine promise and the boon of the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d economy have sent the market higher again here in July with NASDAQ tacking on new all-time highs, though the Dow and S&amp;P 500 continue to struggle. As of yesterday\u2019s close this put DJIA up 4.6%, S&amp;P 500 up 5.7% and NASDAQ up 6.4% for the month of July at yesterday\u2019s close, qualifying this as a \u201cHot July Market\u201d.\n\n&gt; Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by a late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of -7.2% on average (-4.7% median decline) in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year. The low in 2018 came a bit late, but it was just 2 days into winter. There were also prior lower prices in late October and November.\n\n&gt; Climbing COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths have forced rollbacks and pauses of economic reopening plans and travel restrictions. Coupled with an uptick in jobless claims and other troublesome economic readings and forecasts as well as elevated valuations, exuberant sentiment, technical resistance and seasonal weakness, stocks are ripe for a pullback. Today\u2019s selloff: case in point.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/here-comes-one-of-the-newsiest-and-most-critical-weeks-of-the-summer-for-markets.html)**\n*****\n&gt; In a summer of unending news, we may be heading into what could be the newsiest week of all.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq\u2019s sputtering rally could be put to its biggest test yet, as tech bellwether Apple and other stalwarts of the tech rally report earnings. Early in the week, Republicans will unveil their stimulus package proposal, which will then be debated as Friday\u2019s deadline nears for the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve also meets on and is likely to discuss other steps it can take. It\u2019s not likely, however, to make any moves as it wraps up on Wednesday, other than to assure markets it will continue to use extraordinary programs to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Then on Thursday, the government will release a big number many investors have been dreading \u2014 the first official reading of second quarter gross domestic product, which which should show how hard the economy crashed when it was abruptly shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a contraction of about 35% in the second quarter, followed by a bounce back in the third quarter. But the size of that comeback could be directly impacted by how much stimulus Congress gives the economy, and how much the coronavirus continues to impact businesses and economic activity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s a clear understanding of how much the economy has leaned on the crutch of government stimulus, both fiscally and monetarily,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cEveryone will be watching for what will replace the $600 a week, and that will be the most important component of whatever plan they come up with.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The $600 weekly payment to about 30 million unemployed Americans expires Friday, and it is unlikely Congress will have a plan before that date. Strategists expect the amount to be cut in half, and Boockvar said the amount of that payment will directly impact the size of the boost to the economy\n*****\n&gt; The stimulus and tech earnings could both be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat the package looks like will be a huge deal, particularly on the unemployment benefits side, and whether tech companies can exceed the bar,\u201d said Boockvar. \u201cThat\u2019s very hard for them right now. So if they miss, does that mean it\u2019s going to be a negative for tech and not the whole market? Are we going to keep rotating to value from growth because tech has been so dominant it could take everything down?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to decline by 40.3% for the second quarter, based on the results of companies that have already reported and estimates, according to Refinifiv\u2019s I/B/E/S. Technology earnings are expected to have one of the smallest profit declines, at just 4.4% on average.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, which had rallied to record highs this summer, ended lower for a second week, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings numbers overall, they\u2019ve been pretty good. It\u2019s just the basic problem with the stock market right now is that valuations are still pretty high,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cOther parts of the market that maybe look cheap on a price-to-book basis, their earnings have been hit. In the case of certain retailers, airlines, you have to worry about when their business is going to come back, if ever.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 80% of the companies already reporting have beaten Wall Street estimates. That is well above the average beat rate of about 65%, since 1994.\n*****\n&gt; Dozens of major companies report in the coming week, including Facebook on Wednesday and Alphabet and Amazon on Thursday. Pharmaceuticals Merck, Pfizer and Eli Lilly are expected to report, and consumer products names Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and Procter &amp; Gamble also release results. Big oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron report Friday.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus from Congress and the Fed\n&gt; Strategists expect Congress to ultimately adopt a new stimulus package of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, but after the GOP plan is introduced it will have to be squared with Democrats\u2019 proposals. The House has its own $3 trillion spending plan. It is unlikely an agreement can be approved before unemployment benefits expire Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBipartisan negotiations between the White House, House, and Senate are officially underway, but we expect brinkmanship before passage. Trump administration officials also diverge on their expectations on timing, which remains optimistically by the end of July, and possibly stretching into August under the more \u2018realistic\u2019 case,\u201d writes Ed Mills, policy strategist at Raymond James.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills expects the $600 weekly payment to be cut to $300 or $400, and he said it\u2019s possible there would be more funds given to a Payroll Protection Program, to help small businesses.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOverall, momentum is building for the next package and the final price tag is arguably moving up (closer to $1.5 -2 trillion),\u201d Mills noted. Congress has already allocated $2.4 trillion in prior spending.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed will be discussing its own stimulus, and some economists expect it could again be talking about new tactics to keep interest rates low. One idea is a policy of forward guidance, where the Fed would steer market expectations more explicitly. Another is the Fed would use targeted Treasury purchases to control specific interest rates. But no new programs are expected to be announced.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey pretty much told us, they\u2019re all in. They told us they\u2019re willing to do whatever else it takes,\u201d said Keon. \u201cThe Fed is not going to be our problem. The Fed just told us they\u2019re going to do anything they can do to soften the blow from the virus.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/rshk3gVX/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/y6nsD6FQ/marketdata3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/nrVx3NtG/finvizfuts1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/NLhf0Rdn/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/gJmb01rb/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/vBhFxX6g/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Jn6YWFkq/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/85PX9Gjc/maketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/fRgk0Fb6/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C57tdKXj/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/HknGcQpj/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FsD5HPX2/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/Nfgvt3S6/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week\n\n&gt; The earnings slate continues to ramp up next week with 712 total companies scheduled to report. In the table below, we show the largest stocks by market cap that are set to report quarterly results. On Monday, there will be no company with a market cap above $100 billion reporting with the largest companies being Alexandria Real Estate (ARE) and multiple banks. On Tuesday, payment processor Visa (V) will be out with earnings in addition to Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN), McDonald's (MCD), and Raytheon (RTX). Visa has historically averaged the strongest stock price reaction to earnings of these names but it has gapped down for six straight quarters. That will be followed by another payment processor, Paypal (PYPL) on Wednesday. In addition to Paypal, Facebook (FB) is also scheduled to report that same day. While both stocks have averaged over 2% gains on earnings days historically, ServiceNow (NOW) has seen an even stronger performance with an average gain of 3.64%. Another major earnings report that will be widely watched is Boeing (BA) to get a gauge on how demolished travel demand has affected the company. On Thursday, three of the world's largest stocks will also be out with earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG). Each one has averaged a 1%+ gain on earnings days. Apple (AAPL) has seen some of the strongest results in recent history with last quarter snapping a streak of four consecutive triple plays. On Friday, two of the largest energy stocks, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), will round out the week and July's earning calendar. Both stocks have historically averaged declines on earnings days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/Earn3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dollar Weakness May Continue\n\n&gt; The US dollar was remarkably strong during the first quarter of 2020, benefitting from the flight to safety and rallying to nearly a 10% year-to-date gain at the stock market\u2019s low point on March 23. However, as equity markets have recovered, and the US has continued to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the dollar has given up nearly all of those gains. We think this trend may continue, and if so, it would have important implications for a range of asset classes.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a more diversified basket than the commonly cited DXY Index, is nearing a critical uptrend line. A break of this support could mean that weakness seen over the past few months is more than just an unwinding of the flight to safety. Through Wednesday, the index was down more than 1% for the week and tracking toward its fourth straight weekly loss.\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t just a technical story though. As we explored last month, rising twin deficits have historically been followed by a weaker dollar, meaning the fundamentals support this move as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/July-23-picture.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The commodity rally is another reason to believe the market may be looking toward a weaker dollar. Commodities are typically viewed as having an inverse relationship with the dollar since the dollar is effectively the denominator of a hard asset. Gold prices are up more than 20% year to date, copper just traded to its highest level in more than two years, and silver prices have appreciated 28% this month alone.\n\n&gt; As for the implications of a weaker dollar, according to LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201ca weaker US dollar may be a slight negative for US consumers\u2019 buying power, but for investors\u2019 portfolios the implications are overwhelmingly positive. Commodities are rallying, US multinational companies benefit from foreign buyers being able to afford more of their goods, and international stocks do well as their underlying currencies appreciate.\u201d\n\n&gt; Recent history bears this out. The last calendar year that saw a significant dollar decline was 2017 when the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell more than 8%. The S&amp;P 500 Index rallied more than 19% on a price return basis; however, international stocks fared even better. The MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 22% and 34%, respectively, and 2017 represented the only year since 2012 that either outperformed the US.\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Gets the Gold for YTD Performance\n\n&gt; In last night's Closer, we took a look at the massive rallies of late in the precious metals space. Gold (GLD) reached its highest level since 2011, but silver's (SLV) performance on the day was even more of a sight to behold with gains in the top 1% of all days since SLV began trading in 2006. Silver (SLV) rose 6.15% for its best day since March 24th when the metal rose 7.96%. Whereas the silver to gold ratio has been in a constant downtrend over the past decade (indicating underperformance of silver relative to gold), yesterday's big gains led to a breakout of this downtrend. With SLV trading higher by over 5% yet again this morning, that downtrend is being broken even more significantly, and that is even with SLV off the pre-market highs above $21.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; As recently as the final days of June, SLV was actually sitting on a loss year to date. That was a far cry from the performance of some of the best-performing assets of the year at the time like the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) which was up over 14% and the long term Treasuries ETF (TLT) which was up over 21.5%. Silver's yellow cousin, gold, was likewise sitting on a sizeable gain of 16.6%. Pivot ahead to today and the picture is very different. Around this morning's premarket highs when SLV was trading above $21, it actually topped QQQ, TLT, and GLD as the best performing asset in 2020. That is even with each of these other ETFs also trading higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys\n\n&gt; Despite persistent pandemic setbacks, bleak economic and corporate numbers, geopolitical tensions, civic unrest and a knock-down, drag-out election battle, the U.S. stock market has proven rather resilient. After suffering the shortest bear market in history that lasted only 40 days the velocity and strength of the V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low has been impressive.\n\n&gt; Massive fiscal stimulus, the return of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), vaccine promise and the boon of the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d economy have sent the market higher again here in July with NASDAQ tacking on new all-time highs, though the Dow and S&amp;P 500 continue to struggle. As of yesterday\u2019s close this put DJIA up 4.6%, S&amp;P 500 up 5.7% and NASDAQ up 6.4% for the month of July at yesterday\u2019s close, qualifying this as a \u201cHot July Market\u201d.\n\n&gt; Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by a late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of -7.2% on average (-4.7% median decline) in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year. The low in 2018 came a bit late, but it was just 2 days into winter. There were also prior lower prices in late October and November.\n\n&gt; Climbing COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths have forced rollbacks and pauses of economic reopening plans and travel restrictions. Coupled with an uptick in jobless claims and other troublesome economic readings and forecasts as well as elevated valuations, exuberant sentiment, technical resistance and seasonal weakness, stocks are ripe for a pullback. Today\u2019s selloff: case in point.

Revenues have been boosted by pent up demand, competitor closures and stimulus money. Brick-and-mortar same-store sales are expected to grow 60% and online sales are forecast to jump 200%. Most significant for future growth is Hibbett has been winning new customers with 25% of brick-and-mortar sales and 40% of online sales coming from new shoppers.\n\nHome builder **PulteGroup** $PHM (trailing PE 10.04) reported a remarkable rebound in demand as net new orders increased 50% in June.  Home buyers, typically on higher incomes, appear to be less affected by COVID than the average and lower paid general public and, coupled with a \u201cvery limited supply of existing housing stock\u201d, are driving a recovery in the housing market that are boosting home builders.   PulteGroup\u2019s CEO said the recovery in new home demand \u201cwas nothing short of outstanding.\u201d  New home construction jumped 17% and builder confidence rose to pre-pandemic levels after plunging in April. \n\nPulteGroup\u2019s smaller peer **Meritage Homes** $MTH (trailing PE 10.59) reported a much bigger increase with a 32% jump in orders in the second quarter, 78% increase in net earnings, 20% revenue growth and strong margin improvement.   Steven J. Hilton, $MTH chairman and chief executive officer said \u201cBased on our current forecast, we believe we can generate between $4.0-4.3 billion in home closing revenue for the year, including $1.0-1.1 billion for the third quarter, with home closing gross margins around 21% for the third quarter and full year. We estimate that will translate to approximately $8.75-9.25 of diluted earnings per share for the full year,\u201d. **Thats 36% higher than consensus forecasts.**\n\n**Whirlpool** $WHR (trailing PE 12.03) beat expectations with Q2 EPS of $2.15 (compared to estimates for 96 cents) and sales of $4 billion (estimates $3.6 billion).  Both figures were down year-over-year, but the company pointed to \u201csignificant Covid-19 related disruptions.\u201d  CEO Marc Bitzer pointed to decisive actions and the resilence of Whirlpool\u2019s business model while CFO Jim Peters highlighted the \u201csolid cost takeout globally and strong cash flow improvement through disciplined working capital management,\u201d.\n\n**Skechers** $SKX (trailing PE 13.44) reported an earnings beat on Thursday and said \u201cDespite the challenges of the second quarter, we are optimistic about the early-stage recovery we are seeing in much of our business, including... the explosive growth of our e-commerce channel,\u201d.  Remarkably the company was able to grow cash balances by more than $175 million during the quarter through working capital and operating expense management.  As a result net cash accounts for about 20% of Skecher\u2019s valuation.\n\nFinally, with **eBay** (2020f PE 15.70) $EBAY due to report Q2 results on Monday,  A Barron\u2019s article said the stock was a buy with analysts (such as Edward Yruma  at KeyBanc Capital Markets) expecting 23% to 26% growth as new sellers, consumer-facing improvements, and new payment options providing long-term tailwinds for the business. \u201d Yruma thinks eBay has regained lost market share during the Covid-19 pandemic and eventually should grow at rates exceeding overall e-commerce growth \u201cas it both improves its consumer offering and takes advantage of stronger secular trends.\u201d That means, primarily, that marketplace participants are increasingly realizing the importance of selling on multiple platforms.

Revenues have been boosted by pent up demand, competitor closures and stimulus money. Brick-and-mortar same-store sales are expected to grow 60% and online sales are forecast to jump 200%. Most significant for future growth is Hibbett has been winning new customers with 25% of brick-and-mortar sales and 40% of online sales coming from new shoppers.\n\nHome builder **PulteGroup** $PHM (trailing PE 10.04) reported a remarkable rebound in demand as net new orders increased 50% in June.  Home buyers, typically on higher incomes, appear to be less affected by COVID than the average and lower paid general public and, coupled with a \u201cvery limited supply of existing housing stock\u201d, are driving a recovery in the housing market that are boosting home builders.   PulteGroup\u2019s CEO said the recovery in new home demand \u201cwas nothing short of outstanding.\u201d  New home construction jumped 17% and builder confidence rose to pre-pandemic levels after plunging in April. \n\nPulteGroup\u2019s smaller peer **Meritage Homes** $MTH (trailing PE 10.59) reported a much bigger increase with a 32% jump in orders in the second quarter, 78% increase in net earnings, 20% revenue growth and strong margin improvement.   Steven J. Hilton, $MTH chairman and chief executive officer said \u201cBased on our current forecast, we believe we can generate between $4.0-4.3 billion in home closing revenue for the year, including $1.0-1.1 billion for the third quarter, with home closing gross margins around 21% for the third quarter and full year. We estimate that will translate to approximately $8.75-9.25 of diluted earnings per share for the full year,\u201d. **Thats 36% higher than consensus forecasts.**\n\n**Whirlpool** $WHR (trailing PE 12.03) beat expectations with Q2 EPS of $2.15 (compared to estimates for 96 cents) and sales of $4 billion (estimates $3.6 billion).  Both figures were down year-over-year, but the company pointed to \u201csignificant Covid-19 related disruptions.\u201d  CEO Marc Bitzer pointed to decisive actions and the resilence of Whirlpool\u2019s business model while CFO Jim Peters highlighted the \u201csolid cost takeout globally and strong cash flow improvement through disciplined working capital management,\u201d.\n\n**Skechers** $SKX (trailing PE 13.44) reported an earnings beat on Thursday and said \u201cDespite the challenges of the second quarter, we are optimistic about the early-stage recovery we are seeing in much of our business, including... the explosive growth of our e-commerce channel,\u201d.  Remarkably the company was able to grow cash balances by more than $175 million during the quarter through working capital and operating expense management.  As a result net cash accounts for about 20% of Skecher\u2019s valuation.\n\nFinally, with **eBay** (2020f PE 15.70) $EBAY due to report Q2 results on Monday,  A Barron\u2019s article said the stock was a buy with analysts (such as Edward Yruma  at KeyBanc Capital Markets) expecting 23% to 26% growth as new sellers, consumer-facing improvements, and new payment options providing long-term tailwinds for the business. \u201d Yruma thinks eBay has regained lost market share during the Covid-19 pandemic and eventually should grow at rates exceeding overall e-commerce growth \u201cas it both improves its consumer offering and takes advantage of stronger secular trends.\u201d That means, primarily, that marketplace participants are increasingly realizing the importance of selling on multiple platforms.  Trading on just 16x current year estimates, the valuation does look attractive.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everyone.

I replied saying this split was priced in. This is a clear example of something \u201cpriced in\u201d.

You see almost daily people saying COVID-19\u2019s impact on the travel industry is priced in. This statement is a fallacy since the true impact and longevity of the novel virus is unknown. If coronavirus subsides in the latter half of the year with the introduction of a vaccine then saying COVID-19 is priced in may be factually accurate. As airlines have bounced off their March lows it\u2019s been based on the assumption that air travel will resume later this year. However, if COVID-19 worsens with a second wave and lasts well into next year we\u2019ll likely see a significant decline in airline share prices.

Hints that Saudi Arabia and Russia might be close to an oil production cut deal are also helping stocks. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 360 points, capping its third negative week in four and pushing blue chips down 28.8% from their February all-time highs. The prior week, March 23-March 27, saw the best weekly gain for the Dow since 1938. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, who is recovering from heart surgery, released his widely read annual letter. \u201cWe have the resources to emerge from this crisis as a stronger country,\u201d Dimon wrote.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * The price of West Texas Intermediate crude was down about 2% early Monday, well off session lows of 9%. Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund RDIF, told CNBC overnight that Moscow and Riyadh were \u201cvery close\u201d to an output reduction deal. WTI, which surged nearly 32% last week on signs of a possible Saudi-Russian agreement, remained more than 50% off its recent 52-week high in April 2019. On Sunday, President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to impose \u201cvery substantial\u201d tariffs on oil imports. But he said he does not believe he\u2019ll need to do so.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Heading into what the Trump administration has characterized as the toughest week yet in the fight against the coronavirus, U.S. cases surged to over 330,000, the most of any country in the world \u2014 in fact, nearly as many as the next three countries \u2014 Italy, Spain and Germany \u2014 combined, according to Johns Hopkins University data. There have been 9,653 deaths in the U.S. Over a third of all infections and more than 40% of the deaths in America are in New York state, with New York City shouldering most of that burden. Over the weekend, Trump said 1,000 medical military personnel are deploying to New York City to help treat the overwhelming crush of coronavirus patients. Trump also expressed hope that U.S. cases may flatten soon.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.3 million with 70,355 deaths and almost 250,000 recoveries. While U.S. cases and deaths have yet to slow, Europe\u2019s hot spots are seeing signs of possibly leveling off, with Spain, Italy, Germany and France seeing death rates and new infections slowing down. Italy still has the most deaths in the world with 15,887, followed by Spain\u2019s 13,055 fatalities. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 55, was hospitalized for tests Sunday, 10 days after contracting the coronavirus. Since Beijing first reported the outbreak in late December, The New York Times said at least 430,000 people have arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Apple is designing and producing face shields for medical workers, CEO Tim Cook said in a video released Sunday. Apple is aiming to produce 1 million face shields per week.

Hints that Saudi Arabia and Russia might be close to an oil production cut deal are also helping stocks. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 360 points, capping its third negative week in four and pushing blue chips down 28.8% from their February all-time highs. The prior week, March 23-March 27, saw the best weekly gain for the Dow since 1938. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, who is recovering from heart surgery, released his widely read annual letter. \u201cWe have the resources to emerge from this crisis as a stronger country,\u201d Dimon wrote.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * The price of West Texas Intermediate crude was down about 2% early Monday, well off session lows of 9%. Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund RDIF, told CNBC overnight that Moscow and Riyadh were \u201cvery close\u201d to an output reduction deal. WTI, which surged nearly 32% last week on signs of a possible Saudi-Russian agreement, remained more than 50% off its recent 52-week high in April 2019. On Sunday, President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to impose \u201cvery substantial\u201d tariffs on oil imports. But he said he does not believe he\u2019ll need to do so.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Heading into what the Trump administration has characterized as the toughest week yet in the fight against the coronavirus, U.S. cases surged to over 330,000, the most of any country in the world \u2014 in fact, nearly as many as the next three countries \u2014 Italy, Spain and Germany \u2014 combined, according to Johns Hopkins University data. There have been 9,653 deaths in the U.S. Over a third of all infections and more than 40% of the deaths in America are in New York state, with New York City shouldering most of that burden. Over the weekend, Trump said 1,000 medical military personnel are deploying to New York City to help treat the overwhelming crush of coronavirus patients. Trump also expressed hope that U.S. cases may flatten soon.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.3 million with 70,355 deaths and almost 250,000 recoveries. While U.S. cases and deaths have yet to slow, Europe\u2019s hot spots are seeing signs of possibly leveling off, with Spain, Italy, Germany and France seeing death rates and new infections slowing down. Italy still has the most deaths in the world with 15,887, followed by Spain\u2019s 13,055 fatalities. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 55, was hospitalized for tests Sunday, 10 days after contracting the coronavirus. Since Beijing first reported the outbreak in late December, The New York Times said at least 430,000 people have arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Apple is designing and producing face shields for medical workers, CEO Tim Cook said in a video released Sunday. Apple is aiming to produce 1 million face shields per week.
