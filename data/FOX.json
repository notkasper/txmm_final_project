The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell a modest 0.11% and the Dow finished the day 0.04% down. Stocks were able to mostly recover from the deeply red open. \n\nThe Labor Department released their weekly unemployment, which showed that an additional 898,000 new claims were submitted last week, way above the consensus estimate of 830,000.  This is the highest number since Aug. 22 and another clear sign that the labor market continues to struggle to recover in this pandemic-riddled economy as cases rise and worries increase over a renewed wave in the fall and winter. The number represented a gain of 53,000 from the previous week\u2019s. The economy has recaptured some 11.4 million positions, or about half those who were sidelined. The unemployment rate has come down to 7.9% but is still more than double its pre-pandemic level.\n\nAfter Europe seemed to somewhat tame the virus that ravaged the countryside early in the year, the number of newly confirmed infections are skyrocketing, prompting fears of a second-wave and host of new restrictions. Socialising indoors will be banned in London, and a curfew will be imposed in nine French cities. Poland designated red zones where schools and gyms will close, including in the capital Warsaw, and the Czech Republic said it was building its first field hospital for coronavirus patients. Schools in Italy's southern Campania region, including the city of Naples, are to close for two weeks, as the country recorded its highest daily rise of cases since mass testing began. Coronavirus is the fifth-leading cause of death in Europe, where a threshold of 1,000 deaths daily has been passed, the WHO's European director, Dr Hans Kluge, told a news conference today. In the United States, new cases per day are on the rise in 44 states, with the biggest surges in the Midwest and Great Plains, where resistance to wearing masks and observing other social distancing practices has been running high. Deaths per day are climbing in 30 states, according to data collected from John Hopkins University.\n\nMarket participants continue to be fixated on whether more stimulus, which lawmakers and economists say is necessary, will be passed before the November election. Messaging from top officials regarding stimulus has been inconsistent, with Pres. Trump first said he was directing his representatives to halt negotiations before doing a 180[\u00b0](https://www.degreesymbol.net/#:~:text=Degree%20Symbol%20on%20Microsoft%20Windows,0176%20numbers%20of%20degree%20symbol.) turn. Yesterday, Mnuchin conceded that \u201cgetting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult, just given where we are in the level of details\u201d. Today, in response to being asked if he supported stimulus, Pres. Trump told Fox Business, \u201cI would. Absolutely I would. I would say more. I would go higher. Go big or go home, I said it yesterday.\u201d Needless to say the inconsistent messaging heightened volatility in the market as investors have a heightened sense of risk. Additional relief is viewed by many (including Jerome Powell) as a necessary propellant to maintain and speed up economic recovery. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* US regulators (FDA) approved yesterday afternoon the first treatment for Ebola Virus from Regeneron (REGN). This is the same company that made the treatment that President Trump received while being treated for COVID-19 about two weeks ago.\n* US jobless claims reached 898,000 which was higher than the estimates of 830,000.\n* Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PCG) has cut power to around 33,000 customers to mitigate risk of starting a wildfire citing dry and windy conditions renew threat of fires.\n* Boyd Gaming (BYD) had a price increase by Deutsche Bank from $27 to $38 at BUY. Big increase in analyst sentiment, the stock trended upward today.\n* Datadog (DDOG) had a price target raise from Mizuho from $116 to $125 at BUY. It opened low, but recovered throughout the day. Stock has been a monster lately. \n* Dell (DELL) had a price target raised by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) from $70 to $80 at OVERWEIGHT.\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) had price targets raised by Citigroup (C), and Barclays from $285 to $300 at BUY, and $253 to $270 at EQUAL WEIGHT, respectively.

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell a modest 0.11% and the Dow finished the day 0.04% down. Stocks were able to mostly recover from the deeply red open. \n\nThe Labor Department released their weekly unemployment, which showed that an additional 898,000 new claims were submitted last week, way above the consensus estimate of 830,000.  This is the highest number since Aug. 22 and another clear sign that the labor market continues to struggle to recover in this pandemic-riddled economy as cases rise and worries increase over a renewed wave in the fall and winter. The number represented a gain of 53,000 from the previous week\u2019s. The economy has recaptured some 11.4 million positions, or about half those who were sidelined. The unemployment rate has come down to 7.9% but is still more than double its pre-pandemic level.\n\nAfter Europe seemed to somewhat tame the virus that ravaged the countryside early in the year, the number of newly confirmed infections are skyrocketing, prompting fears of a second-wave and host of new restrictions. Socialising indoors will be banned in London, and a curfew will be imposed in nine French cities. Poland designated red zones where schools and gyms will close, including in the capital Warsaw, and the Czech Republic said it was building its first field hospital for coronavirus patients. Schools in Italy's southern Campania region, including the city of Naples, are to close for two weeks, as the country recorded its highest daily rise of cases since mass testing began. Coronavirus is the fifth-leading cause of death in Europe, where a threshold of 1,000 deaths daily has been passed, the WHO's European director, Dr Hans Kluge, told a news conference today. In the United States, new cases per day are on the rise in 44 states, with the biggest surges in the Midwest and Great Plains, where resistance to wearing masks and observing other social distancing practices has been running high. Deaths per day are climbing in 30 states, according to data collected from John Hopkins University.\n\nMarket participants continue to be fixated on whether more stimulus, which lawmakers and economists say is necessary, will be passed before the November election. Messaging from top officials regarding stimulus has been inconsistent, with Pres. Trump first said he was directing his representatives to halt negotiations before doing a 180[\u00b0](https://www.degreesymbol.net/#:~:text=Degree%20Symbol%20on%20Microsoft%20Windows,0176%20numbers%20of%20degree%20symbol.) turn. Yesterday, Mnuchin conceded that \u201cgetting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult, just given where we are in the level of details\u201d. Today, in response to being asked if he supported stimulus, Pres. Trump told Fox Business, \u201cI would. Absolutely I would. I would say more. I would go higher. Go big or go home, I said it yesterday.\u201d Needless to say the inconsistent messaging heightened volatility in the market as investors have a heightened sense of risk. Additional relief is viewed by many (including Jerome Powell) as a necessary propellant to maintain and speed up economic recovery. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* US regulators (FDA) approved yesterday afternoon the first treatment for Ebola Virus from Regeneron (REGN). This is the same company that made the treatment that President Trump received while being treated for COVID-19 about two weeks ago.\n* US jobless claims reached 898,000 which was higher than the estimates of 830,000.\n* Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PCG) has cut power to around 33,000 customers to mitigate risk of starting a wildfire citing dry and windy conditions renew threat of fires.\n* Boyd Gaming (BYD) had a price increase by Deutsche Bank from $27 to $38 at BUY.

Noted near universal agreement from economists who say more aid is needed for individuals, businesses, and local governments, and that the amount is less important than how fast and where the money is deployed. Also discussed aid to state and local governments, which economists say could drive sizable reduction in economic activity if left without additional support, though was a key area of disagreement in latest round of stimulus negotiations. Moody's last month said state and local governments will have budget shortfalls of $500B through summer 2022, assuming pandemic does not get worse.

Cited a potential worsening of the COVID-19 crisis as the flu season approaches with no coronavirus vaccine, a lack of fresh fiscal stimulus, and uncertainty around the election as factors weighing on the labor market recovery. Around 80% of economists said the current election process is introducing more uncertainty into financial markets compared with elections of recent decades, and 73% saying it was creating more uncertainty than usual for the economy. However, the survey showed more optimism around a GDP rebound, with \\~58% of those surveyed expecting economic output to return to its prior peak in Q1-19 by 2021, while \\~19% expect it to recover by Q1-22. On average, the economists expect GDP to contract 3.6% this year, followed by growth of 3.7% in 2021 and 3% in 2022.\n\n**US explores restricting Ant Group and Tencent payment systems:**\n\n* People familiar with the matter told [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/u-s-explores-restrictions-on-ant-group-tencent-payment-systems?sref=J9GPLx1B) Trump administration is exploring restrictions on Ant Group and Tencent Holdings (700-HK ) over concerns their digital payment platforms threaten US national security and give Beijing access to banking and personal data of hundreds of millions of people. Restrictions could involve putting both companies on Treasury Department's national list, which effectively bars firms from doing business with them. Such a move would risk angering China beyond its unhappiness over TikTok. Administration officials discussed idea of restrictions in a 30-Sep meeting, though a final decision isn't imminent with officials acknowledging difficulty in moving forward until a mechanism is established. Also, no indication idea has been presented to Trump.\n\n**BoE Governor Bailey expects a Brexit deal, willing to take more action:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-bailey/bank-of-englands-bailey-says-risks-are-very-much-to-the-downside-idUKKBN26T16D) cited comments by BoE Governor Bailey in the Yorkshire Post, who said he believed the UK and the EU can reach a deal, and in the best interests of both sides. He reiterated that while he would like to see Britain and the EU retain equivalent standards on financial services, it would be wrong to follow EU rules if it had no control over. Meanwhile, on the economic impact from the rising number of coronavirus cases, said it was likely to hurt economy, but less than initial surge earlier this year. In separate comments from SRB panel discussion, highlighted BoE was not out of firepower and would use if it needs in second and third wave of virus.

It highlighted that appreciation of the euro had a material impact on inflation and market positioning was tilted to further gains. It noted that inflation expectations remained close to historic lows, amplifying risks to anchoring and there was broad agreement that there was no room for complacency. Two main FX drivers were identified: a reversal of dollar safe haven flows and the decisive action taken by EU governments on fiscal policy. It was thought that in the prevailing environment of uncertainty, the best course of action was to keep a steady hand on policy. Some made the point that with tensions in the market subsiding the pace of monthly asset purchases could be reduced.

Also highlighted worries further state spending reductions could prolong the economic downturn ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/business/state-budgets-coronavirus-aid.html)).\n\n**WSJ survey shows 43% of economists not expecting full labor market recovery until 2023:**\n\n* A [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-survey-43-of-economists-dont-see-u-s-gaining-back-lost-jobs-until-2023-11602165600) survey showed a slower timeline for a labor market recovery than predicted six months ago, particularly in travel and leisure because of continued high coronavirus infection rates. Cited a potential worsening of the COVID-19 crisis as the flu season approaches with no coronavirus vaccine, a lack of fresh fiscal stimulus, and uncertainty around the election as factors weighing on the labor market recovery. Around 80% of economists said the current election process is introducing more uncertainty into financial markets compared with elections of recent decades, and 73% saying it was creating more uncertainty than usual for the economy. However, the survey showed more optimism around a GDP rebound, with \\~58% of those surveyed expecting economic output to return to its prior peak in Q1-19 by 2021, while \\~19% expect it to recover by Q1-22. On average, the economists expect GDP to contract 3.6% this year, followed by growth of 3.7% in 2021 and 3% in 2022.\n\n**US explores restricting Ant Group and Tencent payment systems:**\n\n* People familiar with the matter told [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/u-s-explores-restrictions-on-ant-group-tencent-payment-systems?sref=J9GPLx1B) Trump administration is exploring restrictions on Ant Group and Tencent Holdings (700-HK ) over concerns their digital payment platforms threaten US national security and give Beijing access to banking and personal data of hundreds of millions of people. Restrictions could involve putting both companies on Treasury Department's national list, which effectively bars firms from doing business with them. Such a move would risk angering China beyond its unhappiness over TikTok. Administration officials discussed idea of restrictions in a 30-Sep meeting, though a final decision isn't imminent with officials acknowledging difficulty in moving forward until a mechanism is established. Also, no indication idea has been presented to Trump.\n\n**BoE Governor Bailey expects a Brexit deal, willing to take more action:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-bailey/bank-of-englands-bailey-says-risks-are-very-much-to-the-downside-idUKKBN26T16D) cited comments by BoE Governor Bailey in the Yorkshire Post, who said he believed the UK and the EU can reach a deal, and in the best interests of both sides. He reiterated that while he would like to see Britain and the EU retain equivalent standards on financial services, it would be wrong to follow EU rules if it had no control over. Meanwhile, on the economic impact from the rising number of coronavirus cases, said it was likely to hurt economy, but less than initial surge earlier this year. In separate comments from SRB panel discussion, highlighted BoE was not out of firepower and would use if it needs in second and third wave of virus. Emphasized it must use policy actively and aggressively. Would use policy tools to the fullest extent possible to support economy ([Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-bailey-firepower/bank-of-england-not-out-of-firepower-bailey-says-idUKKBN26T1D1?il=0))\n\n**ECB minutes emphasize FX impact, warns on complacency:**\n\n* The [ECB](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2020/html/ecb.mg201008~49aeff32e1.en.html) September minutes discussively extensively the impact of a strong euro on the inflation outlook. It highlighted that appreciation of the euro had a material impact on inflation and market positioning was tilted to further gains. It noted that inflation expectations remained close to historic lows, amplifying risks to anchoring and there was broad agreement that there was no room for complacency. Two main FX drivers were identified: a reversal of dollar safe haven flows and the decisive action taken by EU governments on fiscal policy. It was thought that in the prevailing environment of uncertainty, the best course of action was to keep a steady hand on policy. Some made the point that with tensions in the market subsiding the pace of monthly asset purchases could be reduced. On the policy options available, it pointed to a further cut in the policy rate and changes to the TLTROs.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 872207, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Top Stories - October 8, 2020", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j7erl3/top_stories_october_8_2020/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1602166185.0}], [[], false, "MachiavellianFuck", null, [], null, "text", "t2_1xlh4pgx", false, false, [], false, false, 1600307081, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iu9r7x/i_believe_clct_is_in_the_middle_of_a_hostile/", {}, "iu9r7x", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 2, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/iu9r7x/i_believe_clct_is_in_the_middle_of_a_hostile/", false, 6, 1600307092, 1, "I originally posted this to [r/wallstreetbets](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) but I think you guys would find it more interesting. \n\nI believe that Collectors Universe (CLCT) is currently trying to fight off a hostile takeover by Alta Fox Capital Management. \n\n**Background**\n\nCLCT, or Collector's Universe, is best known for their trading card encapsulation and authentication service, PSA.

Founded in 1923 as Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, the company has been behind some of the most famous entertainment characters of all-time. After trading over-the-counter throughout most of the 1940s and 50s, Disney debuted on the NYSE in 1957 for $13.88. If you invested $1,000 in the IPO, you would have been able to purchase 72 shares. After six stock splits in the years since, those shares would equal 27,648 today. With Disney trading at $131.99, an original investment of $1,000 would be worth $3,649,259 today \u2013 3,648% total returns or around 13.9% on an annualized basis. \n\nWhile today Disney is the largest US media company by market cap at $238.5bn, after the death of Walt Disney in 1966, the company struggled to form an identity, experienced a series of internal power struggles, and survived multiple takeover attempts. Did you know that Disney once tried to become the dominant player in web search? Or that at one point Steve Jobs was Disney\u2019s largest shareholder? This week, we look back at the story behind the ups and downs of an American icon and how Disney cemented its position as a global media power and major player in the streaming wars. \n\n**The Lost Decades (1966-1989)**\n\n* Up until the death of Walt Disney in 1966, Disney seemed to produce widely successful movies on a regular basis. Movies like Pinocchio, Fantasia, Snow White, and Lady and the Tramp all attained commercial success or received critical acclaim. On the back of the growing popularity in Disney movies, TV shows, and miniseries, the company opened its first theme park \u2013 Disneyland Park (now Disneyland) \u2013 in 1955. \n* But the deaths of Walt Disney and his brother Roy five years later created a leadership and creativity vacuum that would plague Disney for the next 20 years. By the early 1980s, Disney Studios contributed less than 30% of revenues versus the roughly 70% generated by Disney theme parks. In 1984, the legal predecessor to Universal Studios, a company called MCA, had a deal in principle to acquire Disney. However, the deal fell through after a disagreement over who would lead the merged entity. The next year, Disney fought off a hostile takeover attempt by financial and insurance conglomerate Reliance Group. At that time, Disney was estimated to be worth only $3bn.\n\n**Disney Renaissance (1989-99)**\n\n* Throughout the 1980s, the Disney Studios segment was considered to be on unsteady financial footing. Prior to the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, the company hadn\u2019t released a strong box office performer in years. Fortunes began to change, though, at the turn of the decade. With the Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Best (1991), Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), and Disney-Pixar collaboration Toy Story (1995), revenue for Disney Studios climbed from $2.59bn in 1991 to $10bn by 1996 \u2013 an increase of 286% in only 5 years. \n* Disney\u2019s renewed commercial success throughout the first half of the 90s expanded the broader media ambitions of CEO Michael Eisner. In 1994, the company attempted but failed to buy NBC from General Electric when GE insisted on retaining 51% ownership in the network. In response, [next year Disney bought the parent company of ABC for $19bn](https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2019/11/disney-acquisition-timeline). At the time, the ABC deal was the second largest corporate acquisition ever. Under the deal, Disney also gained a sizable equity stake in A&amp;E Networks as well as 80% of ESPN. In interviews after the deal closed, Eisner stated the move was necessary to keep Disney competitive with the rise of diversified media conglomerates like Comcast. \n* On the surface, Disney maintained its strong box office performance for the rest of the decade. Hits such as Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, Mulan, and Tarzan kept Disney Studio revenues steady after the peak year in 1996. However, behind the scenes Disney was starting to lose track of emerging trends in media as it set its sights on the world wide web. \n* In 1998, Disney registered Go.com in an effort to move into the rapidly growing internet web portal and search market alongside the likes of Yahoo, Infoseek, Excite, and Lycos. Disney would later purchase Infoseek for $1.77bn and integrate the service with web development company \u2013 Starwave \u2013 to try and showcase ABC, ESPN, and its other content via the portal. Disney created a tracking stock for investors to gain exposure to the Disney internet business, but the shares went from over $35 in 1999 to just over $5 in 2001. The entire project would end in 2001 with a $790mn write-down and charge of 37 cents per share. \n\n**Rising Competition and end of Eisner Era (2000-2005)**\n\n* The early 2000s marked a period of challenges on multiple fronts for Disney. Its stock fell from a split-adjusted all-time high of $40 in July 2000 to under $16 only two years later. Between the dot com crash and recession in 2001, then the September 11th attacks, Disney theme parks saw a drastic decrease in revenues. The company was forced to cut costs across the board, including in its Internet and entertainment divisions. Disney tried to opportunistically buy Universal Studios in 2002, but with Disney\u2019s stock at 52-week lows and anti-trust concerns, the deal collapsed. \n* On top of this, Pixar, whose distribution deal with Disney was set to expire in 2004, began to invest heavily in CGI which it saw as the future. Disney on the other hand still focused disproportionately on 2D animation. Shortly after the two companies ended their arrangement, Pixar quickly became the leader in computer graphics-based films with Cars and The Incredibles. Pixar had been generating momentum in CGI for years though. And none of the movies produced in the early 2000s by Disney outside of the Pixar joint-venture would come close to matching the level of success by either Finding Nemo or Monsters, Inc. In addition, Disney faced a growing threat from DreamWorks who had just produced Shrek, which pulled in just under $500mn at the box office. \n* After an unsolicited $54bn bid by Comcast in 2004 and failed attempts to rival Pixar in CGI, the board became increasingly dissatisfied with Eisner. A shareholder boycott organized by board member Roy Disney Jr. saw 45% withhold their proxies to re-elect Eisner. A year later, Disney announced Eisner would be replaced as CEO by Bob Iger. \n\n**Strategic Acquisitions, Expansion, and Box Office Momentum (2006-2015)**\n\n* Pixar and Disney didn\u2019t stay apart for long. In 2006, Iger completed his first acquisition as CEO buying Pixar for $7.4bn (though talks started under Eisner). As part of the deal, Steve Jobs, who was Pixar CEO at the time and held 50.1% of shares, became a Disney board member and the company\u2019s largest single shareholder with 7% of shares. When the deal was announced, analysts felt the price was too expensive. Yet the first three releases for Pixar as a Disney subsidiary \u2013 Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up, would bring in a combined $1.89bn at the box office over the next three years.\n* In 2009, Disney also purchased Marvel Entertainment for $4bn. One analyst from Barclays Capital quipped \u201cSpider-Man will appear in \u2018A Bug\u2019s Life\u2019 sequel,\u201d while the New York Times called the deal a \u201csurprise\u201d and questioned whether Disney could effectively monetize \u201clesser-known\u201d characters aside from Spider-Man and the X-Men. Over a decade later, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has grossed over $22.5bn with more than 20 moves including the highest-grossing movie of all-time in Avengers: Endgame. \n* The success of the Pixar and Marvel acquisitions expanded Iger\u2019s appetite for more content. And in 2012, Disney bought Lucasfilm to take control of Star Wars and revealed plans for a seventh installment in the franchise in 2015. The three Star Wars films released since the acquisition grossed $4.47bn. Between the combination of Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm, Disney achieved a record 80% of box office sales in 2019 with the top six movies that year. Also in 2019, Disney made over $8 billion from movie ticket sales \u2013 the most any studio has ever earned in a single year.\n\n**Disney Arrives to Streaming Wars (2016-Present)**\n\n* With all the high-profile moves by Disney over the previous decade, its purchase of a 33% stake in Major League Baseball\u2019s media and technology unit BAMTech flew relatively under the radar. But it was perhaps the first public signaling of the company\u2019s ambitions to move into streaming in a big way. Disney bought a controlling stake in BAMTech the next year for $1.58bn, saying that it planned to use the infrastructure to develop ESPN\u2019s own over-the-top service (what is now ESPN+). More importantly, the company announced that it would be launching a competing internet streaming service \u2013 Disney+ \u2013and not renewing distribution rights with Netflix for Disney content beyond 2019.  \n* Later in 2017, Disney entered into an agreement to purchase the majority assets of 21st Century Fox: film entertainment, cable TV, and satellite divisions. Although Comcast attempted to make a competing offer, the deal closed in early 2019. In addition to acquiring a rich library of media content, Disney also received 21st Century Fox\u2019s 30% stake in Hulu. While Disney had helped stand up Hulu in 2007, with the Fox acquisition, the company began a strategic move to take operational control of Hulu which was experiencing significant growth \u2013 from 1.5mn subscribers in 2011 to 12mn in 2016. Disney eventually paid AT&amp;T for its stake then Comcast for theirs to seize full control of Hulu in May 2019.\n* Disney+ launched in November 2019 in the US, Canada, Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand. The company\u2019s own original projections for Disney+ had the platform reaching 30mn by 2024. As of August 2020, over 60mn people use Disney+ (including Hotstar in India). Across its three services \u2013 ESPN+, Hulu, and Disney+ \u2013 Disney already has more than 100mn subscribers. In its most recent quarter, Disney noted that ESPN+ grew subs above 100% year-over-year and Hulu grew 27%.  \n* Despite the boost from stay-at-home work and COVID-induced quarantines, the early success of Disney+ is particularly impressive considering the platform has more or less yet to begin introducing new original content aside from the Mandalorian and a few other features. Disney will also launch another streaming service in 2021 oriented around \u201cgeneral entertainment\u201d, featuring content from ABC Studios, Fox, FX, Freeform, 20th Century Studios, and Searchlight. And recent analyst estimates project Disney+ alone could surpass 200mn subscribers by 2025. \n* With all of these moves, under Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s stock rose from $27 in March 2005 to over $140 in February 2020 before he departed his post (Iger has temporarily stepped back in to aid his replacement Bob Chapek until 2021 due to pressures associated with the global pandemic and theme park demand). \n\n*You can also find me on Twitter* [*@BlackjacketCo*](https://twitter.com/BlackjacketCo) *where I write about stock ideas, emerging technologies, and long-term market trends.

Founded in 1923 as Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, the company has been behind some of the most famous entertainment characters of all-time. After trading over-the-counter throughout most of the 1940s and 50s, Disney debuted on the NYSE in 1957 for $13.88. If you invested $1,000 in the IPO, you would have been able to purchase 72 shares. After six stock splits in the years since, those shares would equal 27,648 today. With Disney trading at $131.99, an original investment of $1,000 would be worth $3,649,259 today \u2013 3,648% total returns or around 13.9% on an annualized basis. \n\nWhile today Disney is the largest US media company by market cap at $238.5bn, after the death of Walt Disney in 1966, the company struggled to form an identity, experienced a series of internal power struggles, and survived multiple takeover attempts. Did you know that Disney once tried to become the dominant player in web search? Or that at one point Steve Jobs was Disney\u2019s largest shareholder? This week, we look back at the story behind the ups and downs of an American icon and how Disney cemented its position as a global media power and major player in the streaming wars. \n\n**The Lost Decades (1966-1989)**\n\n* Up until the death of Walt Disney in 1966, Disney seemed to produce widely successful movies on a regular basis. Movies like Pinocchio, Fantasia, Snow White, and Lady and the Tramp all attained commercial success or received critical acclaim. On the back of the growing popularity in Disney movies, TV shows, and miniseries, the company opened its first theme park \u2013 Disneyland Park (now Disneyland) \u2013 in 1955. \n* But the deaths of Walt Disney and his brother Roy five years later created a leadership and creativity vacuum that would plague Disney for the next 20 years. By the early 1980s, Disney Studios contributed less than 30% of revenues versus the roughly 70% generated by Disney theme parks. In 1984, the legal predecessor to Universal Studios, a company called MCA, had a deal in principle to acquire Disney. However, the deal fell through after a disagreement over who would lead the merged entity. The next year, Disney fought off a hostile takeover attempt by financial and insurance conglomerate Reliance Group. At that time, Disney was estimated to be worth only $3bn.\n\n**Disney Renaissance (1989-99)**\n\n* Throughout the 1980s, the Disney Studios segment was considered to be on unsteady financial footing. Prior to the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, the company hadn\u2019t released a strong box office performer in years. Fortunes began to change, though, at the turn of the decade. With the Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Best (1991), Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), and Disney-Pixar collaboration Toy Story (1995), revenue for Disney Studios climbed from $2.59bn in 1991 to $10bn by 1996 \u2013 an increase of 286% in only 5 years. \n* Disney\u2019s renewed commercial success throughout the first half of the 90s expanded the broader media ambitions of CEO Michael Eisner. In 1994, the company attempted but failed to buy NBC from General Electric when GE insisted on retaining 51% ownership in the network. In response, [next year Disney bought the parent company of ABC for $19bn](https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2019/11/disney-acquisition-timeline). At the time, the ABC deal was the second largest corporate acquisition ever. Under the deal, Disney also gained a sizable equity stake in A&amp;E Networks as well as 80% of ESPN. In interviews after the deal closed, Eisner stated the move was necessary to keep Disney competitive with the rise of diversified media conglomerates like Comcast. \n* On the surface, Disney maintained its strong box office performance for the rest of the decade. Hits such as Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, Mulan, and Tarzan kept Disney Studio revenues steady after the peak year in 1996. However, behind the scenes Disney was starting to lose track of emerging trends in media as it set its sights on the world wide web. \n* In 1998, Disney registered Go.com in an effort to move into the rapidly growing internet web portal and search market alongside the likes of Yahoo, Infoseek, Excite, and Lycos. Disney would later purchase Infoseek for $1.77bn and integrate the service with web development company \u2013 Starwave \u2013 to try and showcase ABC, ESPN, and its other content via the portal. Disney created a tracking stock for investors to gain exposure to the Disney internet business, but the shares went from over $35 in 1999 to just over $5 in 2001. The entire project would end in 2001 with a $790mn write-down and charge of 37 cents per share. \n\n**Rising Competition and end of Eisner Era (2000-2005)**\n\n* The early 2000s marked a period of challenges on multiple fronts for Disney. Its stock fell from a split-adjusted all-time high of $40 in July 2000 to under $16 only two years later. Between the dot com crash and recession in 2001, then the September 11th attacks, Disney theme parks saw a drastic decrease in revenues. The company was forced to cut costs across the board, including in its Internet and entertainment divisions. Disney tried to opportunistically buy Universal Studios in 2002, but with Disney\u2019s stock at 52-week lows and anti-trust concerns, the deal collapsed. \n* On top of this, Pixar, whose distribution deal with Disney was set to expire in 2004, began to invest heavily in CGI which it saw as the future. Disney on the other hand still focused disproportionately on 2D animation. Shortly after the two companies ended their arrangement, Pixar quickly became the leader in computer graphics-based films with Cars and The Incredibles. Pixar had been generating momentum in CGI for years though. And none of the movies produced in the early 2000s by Disney outside of the Pixar joint-venture would come close to matching the level of success by either Finding Nemo or Monsters, Inc. In addition, Disney faced a growing threat from DreamWorks who had just produced Shrek, which pulled in just under $500mn at the box office. \n* After an unsolicited $54bn bid by Comcast in 2004 and failed attempts to rival Pixar in CGI, the board became increasingly dissatisfied with Eisner. A shareholder boycott organized by board member Roy Disney Jr. saw 45% withhold their proxies to re-elect Eisner. A year later, Disney announced Eisner would be replaced as CEO by Bob Iger. \n\n**Strategic Acquisitions, Expansion, and Box Office Momentum (2006-2015)**\n\n* Pixar and Disney didn\u2019t stay apart for long. In 2006, Iger completed his first acquisition as CEO buying Pixar for $7.4bn (though talks started under Eisner). As part of the deal, Steve Jobs, who was Pixar CEO at the time and held 50.1% of shares, became a Disney board member and the company\u2019s largest single shareholder with 7% of shares. When the deal was announced, analysts felt the price was too expensive. Yet the first three releases for Pixar as a Disney subsidiary \u2013 Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up, would bring in a combined $1.89bn at the box office over the next three years.\n* In 2009, Disney also purchased Marvel Entertainment for $4bn. One analyst from Barclays Capital quipped \u201cSpider-Man will appear in \u2018A Bug\u2019s Life\u2019 sequel,\u201d while the New York Times called the deal a \u201csurprise\u201d and questioned whether Disney could effectively monetize \u201clesser-known\u201d characters aside from Spider-Man and the X-Men. Over a decade later, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has grossed over $22.5bn with more than 20 moves including the highest-grossing movie of all-time in Avengers: Endgame. \n* The success of the Pixar and Marvel acquisitions expanded Iger\u2019s appetite for more content. And in 2012, Disney bought Lucasfilm to take control of Star Wars and revealed plans for a seventh installment in the franchise in 2015. The three Star Wars films released since the acquisition grossed $4.47bn. Between the combination of Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm, Disney achieved a record 80% of box office sales in 2019 with the top six movies that year. Also in 2019, Disney made over $8 billion from movie ticket sales \u2013 the most any studio has ever earned in a single year.\n\n**Disney Arrives to Streaming Wars (2016-Present)**\n\n* With all the high-profile moves by Disney over the previous decade, its purchase of a 33% stake in Major League Baseball\u2019s media and technology unit BAMTech flew relatively under the radar. But it was perhaps the first public signaling of the company\u2019s ambitions to move into streaming in a big way.

The [US stock index futures](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing) slid by more than 400 points after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said that the trade deal \u2018is over\u2019 on Fox News. This came after the long tension between China and the US over the handling of [coronavirus pandemic](https://stockmarket.com/investing/health-care-stocks/3-ai-healthcare-stocks-to-watch-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-06-22).\u00a0\n\nLater, Navarro said that his comments were \u201ctaken wildly out of context\u201d. He said it has nothing to do with the phase one trade deal, which continues in place. Shortly after, Trump also said via Twitter on Monday night that \u201cThe China trade deal is fully intact.

That shows the healthcare system is beginning to deliver some positive results. The world is in a better position now if you compare it to a few months ago, with various potential therapies on trial. With social distancing and face masks now mandated in certain states, hopefully, this could slow down the transmission of viruses and eventually eliminate them.\n\nThere has been quite a bit of investor\u2019 optimism over the prospect of a global economic recovery. This has been challenged by a resurgence in Covid-19 cases in the US and China, as well as parts of Europe and the Americas.\n\n**3) US Stock Futures Reverse Course After Trump\u2019s Reassurance**\n\nUS equity futures reversed losses after Trump said the trade deal is still intact. Global stocks also rebounded from a sharp dip after Washington retracted Navarro\u2019s comment. With positive sentiments across Asia and Europe, we could expect the same outcome for the US stock market today.\n\nThe friction between the US and China seems to return to the fore after the controversial national security law in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous territory. Not to mention the mistrust between both China and the US on the handling of the coronavirus outbreak. This does indicate that the market remains very sensitive to US-China tensions. Any slight negative remark could put a blow to the performance of the global equity market.\n\n**4) Oil Price Climbed Higher On Global Recovery Trade-Winds**\n\nWith hopes of business activities resuming globally, WTI oil has rebounded to $40 per barrel whereas Brent crude is at $43.38 per barrel (at the time of writing). Some analysts have come out with bullish forecasts for the near term. But, plenty of risks remain. With infection rates not slowing down in key markets, it is reasonable to assume that we are going to deal with sluggish oil prices in a prolonged period.\u00a0\n\n**5) Gold Likely To Hover Around High Range**\n\nThe return of the global recovery trade with a lower dollar did not stop the enthusiasm of gold investors yesterday. Gold climbed to an intra-day high of $1763.00, brushing slightly away from the $1765.00 multi-month resistance. The higher gold price appears to be contributed by some strong tailwinds from the US bond market.\u00a0\n\nHowever, investors must be cautious and treat the rally of the gold price with not more than a pinch of salt. We\u2019ve seen this before, with bulls severely disappointed as gold retreated from this resistance zone. Until we have a consistent gold price above $1765.00 for an extended period, caution is warranted as a bull-trap is possible.\u00a0\n\nLooking forward, the US-China story and the pandemic updates are likely to keep entertaining gold traders.

Their 2019 1.42 billion doller acquisition of Boston based software company Carbonite, who focused mainly on providing software backups and data protection, also gives them more strings to their bow in the ever growing cloud industry.\n\nThey have around 684 companies that use their software, some of the biggest companies are: Aegon, BMW, British American Tobacco, T-Mobile, Fox, Michelin, Qualcomm, Rio Tinto and Unilever. With more and more companies placing emphasis on online work and the importance of the cloud, OpenText is well situated to profit from these trend in the coming decade.\n\nSecond company:\nTakeTwo Entertainment (TTWO)\nMarket cap: 15.95 billion\nCurrent share price: 140.51 USD\nYear high: 140.51 USD\nForeward PE: 32.38\nTotal cash: 2 billion\nTotal debt: 177.25 million\nEstimated growth next year: -7.90% but with a 5 year estimate of 11.88% per annum\nEstimated sales growth: -5.10%\n\u00a0\nOne of the largest video game companies in the world and holder of titles like GTA, Red Dead Redemption, Bioshock, Borderlands, Civilization and NBA2K. These blockbuster gaming franchises make them the producers of the most popular video games in several of the gaming genres. They also recently signed a deal with the NBA to extend their popular 2K series, which also grants them the rights to the ever growing popularity of e-sports focused on NBA2K.\n\nIn the recent year they have also shifted their focus more towards the mobile gaming industry, an industry responsible for 60% of the global video game market in 2019 and forecast to grow much more in the coming years. With the video game market as a whole growing and more and more people using their spare time to play video games, TakeTwo is well positioned for the future growth that comes with the industry, especially as games get more realistic and virtual reality starts playing a big role in these games.\n\nThird company:\nBlackberry (BB)\nMarket cap: 2.54 billion\nCurrent share price: 4.54 USD\nYear high: 8.96 USD\nForeward PE: 28.38\nTotal cash: 909 million\nTotal debt: 758 million\nEstimated growth next year: 166.70%\nEstimated sales growth: 10.70%\n\nLast but not least, the company that everyone still associates with their popular cellphones in the 2010's.

activity that isn\u2019t part of any prearranged plans like repurchase programs, 10b5-1 plans, incentive programs, performance bonuses, yearly bonuses, etc).\n\nLast week we found W.P. Carey, Solar Capital, and Westlake Chemical Partners.\n\n### 1) W. P. Carey Inc. ([$WPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/wpc/)) - Insider Purchases\n\n\\*Unfortunately, we were a little slow in getting our analysis on W.P. Carey out (we found them on March 20th) as we were busy filtering through all the Executive Compensation activity, so the stock has rebounded 18% since we found them. However, they are still a prime candidate to keep an eye on as they are down significantly over the last month.\\*\n\nFrom [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/wpc/):\n\n&gt;W. P. Carey ranks among the largest net lease REITs with an enterprise value of approximately $21 billion and a diversified portfolio of operationally-critical commercial real estate that includes 1,204 net lease properties covering approximately 138 million square feet.\n\nW. P. Carey was having a good start to the year, reaching a peak stock price of $88.27 before crashing 44% over the last month to a closing price of $49.36 on March 20th (their closing price on March 27th was $60.34).\n\nThe recent [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=1025378&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0) activity shows that none of the executives\u2019 purchases were particularly large from a percentage of their total holdings standpoint, but that is because all of the executives (except for the Chief Accounting Officer) already own over $20M in stock. All of the executives except for the Chief Accounting Officer spent over $400,000 repurchasing stock while the 3 directors increased their holdings by 37%, 20%, and 11%.\n\nThe only executive that did not purchase any stock is their CFO.\n\nDate|Executive Name|Title|Type|Stock Type|Avg Price|Total Purchased|# of Shares|Total Shares|Share Increase\n----|--------------|-----|----|----------|---------------|-----------|------------|---------------|----------|\n2020-03-19|John Park|President|P-Purchase|Common |$43.56|$435.6K|10.0K|511.8K|2%\n2020-03-19|Gino Sabatini|Managing Director|P-Purchase|Common |$42.18|$421.8K|10.0K|669.6K|2%\n2020-03-19|Jason Fox|CEO|P-Purchase|Common |$46.00|$460.0K|10.0K|541.8K|2%\n2020-03-18|Arjun Mahalingam|Chief Accounting|P-Purchase|Common |$53.50|$15.2K|0.3K|6.6K|4%\n2020-03-17|Mark Alexander|Director|P-Purchase|Common |$61.58|$246.3K|4.0K|14.9K|37%\n2020-03-16|Peter Farrell|Director|P-Purchase|Common |$64.50|$98.4K|1.5K|9.3K|20%\n2020-03-16|Christopher Niehaus|Director|P-Purchase|Common |$64.68|$97.0K|1.5K|14.7K|11%\n\nThe individual Form 4 [forms](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1025378/000120919120020298/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) show give no explanation for the purchases, so we can assume that it isn\u2019t part of any sort of pre-arranged plan. \n\nThe [Proxy Statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1025378/000104746919001969/a2238264zdef14a.htm) verifies that W. P. Carey does have ownership guidelines stating that the CEO must hold 6x their annual salary in the stock, the other named executives must hold 3x their annual salary, and the Directors must hold 5x their cash retainers.\n\nEveryone except for one of the Directors holds a substantial amount more stock than they are required even after taking a 44% haircut on the stock price over the last month.\n\n*\\* The Chief Accounting Officers salary was not present in the most recent Proxy Statement \\**\n\nDate|Executive Name|Title|$ Amt Owned|$ Amt Required|Delta\n----|--------------|-----|----|----------|---------------|-----------|------------|---------------|----------|\n2020-03-19|John Park|President|$25.3M|$1.6M|$23.7M\n2020-03-19|Gino Sabatini|Managing Director|$33.1M|$1.5M|$31.6M\n2020-03-19|Jason Fox|CEO|$26.7M|$4.2M|$22.5M\n2020-03-18|Arjun Mahalingam|Chief Accounting|$327.4K|N/A|N/A\n2020-03-17|Mark Alexander|Director|$734.4K|$500.0K|$234.4K\n2020-03-16|Peter Farrell|Director|$458.7K|$500.0K|-$41.3K\n2020-03-16|Christopher Niehaus|Director|$723.2K|$500.0K|$223.2K\n\nW. P. Carey shows some intriguing insider purchasing activity and the substantial amount of money their top executives have invested in the company shows that they have a lot of skin in the game and are heavily incentivized to get that stock price back up to where it was before the crash.\n\n### 2) Solar Capital Ltd ([$SLRC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/slrc/)) - Purchasing Activity\n\nFrom [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/slrc/):\n\n&gt;Solar Capital Ltd. is a business development company specializing in secured debt (first lien unitranche and second lien), subordinated (unsecured) debt, minority equity, and strategic income-oriented control equity investments in leveraged middle market companies.\n\nLike most companies in the Asset Management industry, Solar Capital got crushed by this market downturn falling from their recent high of $21.12 down to their close of $10.62 on March 25th (a 49% decline).\n\nThe recent Form 4 [activity](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=1418076&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0) shows quite a bit of purchasing activity by the executives since the beginning of March (especially by the co-CEO, Michael Gross).\n\nThe table below shows that all of the executives (and one director) made sizable 6-figure (and one 7-figure) purchases (except for the Chief Compliance Officer) and all made very sizable percentage increases to their holdings.\n\nDate|Executive Name|Title|Type|Stock Type|Avg Price|Total Purchased|# of Shares|Total Shares|Share Increase\n----|--------------|-----|----|----------|---------------|-----------|------------|---------------|----------|\n2020-03-23|Michael Gross|Co-CEO|P-Purchase|Common |$9.49|$794.3K|83.7K|249.6K|50%\n2020-03-23|Michael Gross|Co-CEO|P-Purchase|Common - Indirect|$12.00|$1.1M|92.5K|2.4M|4%\n2020-03-23|Richard Peteka|CFO|P-Purchase|Common |$8.99|$116.9K|13.0K|24.0K|118%\n2020-03-23|Bruce Spohler|Co-CEO|P-Purchase|Common |$9.32|$498.9K|53.5K|67.5K|382%\n2020-03-20|Guy Talarico|Chief Compliance|P-Purchase|Common |$10.35|$33.1K|3.2K|10.4K|45%\n2020-03-20|David Wachter|Director|P-Purchase|Common |$10.59|$211.8K|20.0K|46.4K|76%\n\nYou will notice above that Mr. Gross made a 7-figure \u201cindirect\u201d purchase on top of his almost $800,000 direct purchase. Looking into his [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1186884/000089924320009195/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) shows us that most of that indirect ownership is through the Employee Stock Plan, Solar Capital Investors, and Solar Capital Investors 2, which both him and the other co-CEO, Bruce Spohler, have an ownership stake in.\n\nAccording to their [Proxy Statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418076/000119312519222090/d747559ddef14a.htm), it does not appear that Solar Capital has any ownership guidelines. This leads us to believe that these executive purchases could have been made because the executives believe the stock is at a great buying price. \n\n### 3) Westlake Chemical Partners ([$WLKP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/wlkp/)) - Purchasing Activity\n\nFrom [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/wlkp/):\n\n&gt;Westlake Chemical Partners LP acquires, develops, and operates ethylene production facilities and related assets in the United States. The company's ethylene production facilities primarily convert ethane into ethylene. It also sells ethylene co-products, including propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline, and hydrogen directly to third parties on a spot or contract basis.\n\nWestlake has had a rough start to the year.

None of the other purchases were particularly large from a dollar value perspective, but they all notably increased their amount of shares owned from a percentage perspective. We also find that Randy Woelfel, the sole director that made purchases, bought stock in the company for the first time (at a very good price too).\n\nDate|Executive Name|Title|Type|Stock Type|Avg Price|Total Purchased|# of Shares|Total Shares|Share Increase\n----|--------------|-----|----|----------|---------------|-----------|------------|---------------|----------|\n2020-03-24|Albert Chao|CEO|P-Purchase|Common|$13.75|$962.5K|70.0K|166.4K|73%\n2020-03-23|Randy Woelfel|Director|P-Purchase|Common |$12.90|$129.0K|10.0K|10.0K|100%\n2020-03-23|Benjamin Ederington|General Counsel|P-Purchase|Common |$14.75|$29.5K|2.0K|12.0K|20%\n2020-03-12|Mark Bender|CFO|P-Purchase|Common |$15.00|$30.0K|2.0K|14.0K|17%\n2020-03-10|Lawrence Teel|\"SVP| Olefins\"|P-Purchase|Common |$17.40|$87.0K|5.0K|12.8K|64%\n\nTaking a look at the CEO\u2019s [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1299403/000156761920006871/xslF345X03/doc1.xml), we first can verify that these purchases were not part of any pre-arranged plans.
