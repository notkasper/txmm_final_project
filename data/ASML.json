The resulting curve-flattening activity was a headwind for the banks due to the possibility of reduced net interest income. The SPDR S&amp;P Bank ETF (KBE 33.08, -1.88, -5.4%) dropped 5.4%. \n* The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield declined 11 basis points to 0.77%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 93.49.

EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. **Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$)**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n35B Xilinx Takeover\n\nThen there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint:\n\n[AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2020/10/28/amds-35-billion-acquisition-of-xilinx-is-another-stroke-of-strategic-brilliance/?sh=f76ffe71c9f8)\n\n[AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel](https://analyticsindiamag.com/amd-buys-xilinx-chip-intel-impact/)\n\nSince this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in **TAM: Total Available Market**. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets&gt;more chips to sell&gt; &gt;more profits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew GPU Reveal\n\nThen there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA\u2019s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: **their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market.**\n\nThis has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and **AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment**. As Jim Cramer said: He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO\n\n**RISK**\n\nOf course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won\u2019t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI\u2019ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro.

group held up better than growth. **Consumer discretionary** was the worst performer, weighed down by AMZN-US , housing retail, footwear and hotels. **Communication services** underperformed with a drag from telecoms and DIS-US giving back some of yesterday's solid gains. **Financials** were behind on sharp declines in money center banks amid WFC-US and BAC-US results. **Healthcare** trailed with managed care weaker (UNH-US results), but hospitals and distributors better. **Consumer staples** in line with beverages, discounters, HPCs, foods modestly lower. **Tech** outperformed with semi-cap (ASML-US results), internet, and services among worst groups. **Energy** gained, following WTI higher, with refiners and services strongest and E&amp;Ps getting an M&amp;A (CXO-US ) boost. **Materials** groups were broadly higher, with precious metals miners, steel and commodity chemicals among bright spots. **Industrials** finished best on strength across transports, machinery, electricals/multis.\n\n**Fiscal stimulus headlines are more noise than news right now:**\n\n* There seems to be more noise than news in the fiscal stimulus headlines in recent days, exacerbating skepticism about the prospects for a deal on a fifth coronavirus relief package. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said today that getting a deal done before the election will be difficult and talks are far apart on issues like state aid. While the gap between House Democrats and the White House has narrowed to \\~$400B, issues also including healthcare aid and apportion tax credits remain key sticking points ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-13/pelosi-calls-for-trump-to-revamp-1-8-trillion-stimulus-proposal?sref=L75TRUmI)). In addition, Pelosi said she does not feel pressure to come down to the White House's $1.8T offer, highlighting Democrats' leverage following Trump's renewed prodding to \"go big or go home\" ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/10/13/senate-stimulus-trump/)). Trump's pleas have failed to resonate with Senate Republicans, who have said they have little appetite for meaningful stimulus. They plan to vote on a $500B plan next week though it is expected to be blocked again by Democrats.\n\n**Bank earnings a mixed bag:**\n\n* Mixed takeaways from the latest batch of bank earnings. **Wells Fargo** (WFC-US ) a big decliner after core EPS missed on weaker NII and expenses that remained elevated. **BofA** (BAC-US ) also under pressure as its earnings beat was largely driven by lower provisions while NII and NIM remained pressured and unlike peers, trading missed. **Goldman Sachs** (GS-US ) a relative bright spot on the back of a blowout Q with trading, equity investments and expense control the highlights. Regional names **US Bancorp** (USB-US ) and **PNC Financial** (PNC-US ) have held up better after both beat on lower provisions and better fee income. Follows weakness in both **JPMorgan** (JPM-US ) and **Citi** (C-US ) on Tuesday despite their earnings beats. Top-line pressure from depressed rate backdrop mentioned as an overhang with pullback in Citi exacerbated by uncertainty on expenses related to consent orders.\n\n**Latest US and China tensions center on Ant Group, sanctions on Hong Kong's Lam:**\n\n* The latest bout of US and China tensions included a [Reuters](https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-antfinancial-blacklist-exclusive/exclusive-trump-administration-to-consider-adding-chinas-ant-group-to-trade-blacklist-sources-idINKBN26Z2UV) report that said the Trump administration is considering adding China's Ant Group to a trade blacklist. The report said the State Department has submitted a proposal just as the fintech arm of e-comm giant Alibaba (BABA-US ) is set to go public. The article noted it isn't clear when the US government will decide whether to add the company to the Entity List for review, but comes as the White House attempts to dissuade US investors from taking part of the $35B IPO. Elsewhere, [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-hongkong-report/u-s-state-department-issues-sanctions-warning-to-banks-over-hong-kong-crackdown-idUKKBN26Z2UC) also reported that the State Department issued sanctions on 10 individuals, including Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, over the crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong. US and China tensions have been put on the backburner in recent months with the market mostly now ignoring issues such as Xinjiang, Huawei, and the sale of TikTok to ORCL-US .\n\n**Uptick in US coronavirus cases spark worries next big wave has begun:**\n\n* [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/10/13/coronavirus-cases-rising/) discussed how US coronavirus cases are rising again, with Midwestern states a particular area of scrutiny, raising concerns that a widely previewed renewed wave of infections this fall and winter has begun. Noted that since Saturday, more than 20 states have hit a new high in their seven-day average case counts. More than half those states set records again on Tuesday. Winter effect, resumption of businesses and schools and social distancing fatigue all flagged as potential drivers of the uptick. Market has tended to ignore case counts for the better part of the last six months or so, focusing instead on better treatments and even more importantly, expectations of a near-term vaccine breakthrough. Despite some recent pauses in vaccine and treatment trials, optimism on both fronts remains fairly elevated.\n\n**The earnings bar looks higher:**\n\n* A higher bar seems to be one of the (very) early themes of Q3 earnings season as elevated beat rates have not necessarily translated to positive stock-price reactions. This fits with the widespread preview discussion about how sell-side earnings estimates bucked the norm and increased over the course of the quarter. Positive guidance and revision trends have been driven by the same dynamics that dominated the Q2 earnings season narrative, particularly the combination of a bombed-out expectations in the initial wake of the pandemic and a better-than-expected macro backdrop (helped by stimulus). Some strategists have also warned that given the extent of the rebound over the past six months or so, earnings revisions are likely to slow from here. There have also been thoughts that Q3 results could be overshadowed by election and coronavirus narratives.\n\n**ConocoPhillips in talks to acquire Concho Resources:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-14/conocophillips-is-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-concho-resources?sref=L75TRUmI), citing people familiar with the matter, reported that ConocoPhillips (COP-US ) is in talks to acquire rival Concho Resources (CXO-US ). Article said a deal could be announced in the next few weeks though it did not provide any color on potential terms. It pointed out that a deal would continue a trend of E&amp;P companies looking to bolster their presence in the oil-rich Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. In July, Chevron (CVX-US ) agreed to purchase Noble Energy for \\~$5B. Article also discussed how Conoco has signaled in recent months that it may pursue M&amp;A opportunities given depressed takeover premiums in the shale space. Early sell-side takeaways have highlighted the strategic merits of a deal and noted that a combination would likely be accretive.\n\n**Focus on the Senate:**\n\n* Morgan Stanley said that with polls, betting markets, and polling-based models pointing to a sizable advantage for Biden in the presidential election, investors should focus on the Senate. It pointed out that if Democrats win the presidency, control of the Senate will determine the difference between meaningful stimulus and fiscal gridlock. Heightened expectations for a Democratic sweep have been cited as a recent tailwind for stocks, marking a shift from longer-standing concerns about higher taxes, new regulations and antitrust scrutiny. While Morgan Stanley said a Democratic sweep could lead to downside pressure in equities, it added that this would likely be temporary and a potential dip-buying opportunity. According to [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/senate/), Democrats are currently slight favorites to win the Senate.\n\n**Fed Vice Chair Clarida offers cautious outlook in a busy day of Fedspeak:**\n\n* Fed Vice Chair Clarida ([speech](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20201014a.htm)) expressed optimism on the economic recovery so far, though cautioned that could take a year for the US economy to return to pre-pandemic levels while full employment could take even longer. In Q&amp;A, Clarida also said that it's not up to the Fed to put people out of work based on what models say, and that it's not up to policymakers to pick economic winners and losers. However, he said there's pent-up demand in the service sector, and accumulated savings could be a tailwind. Elsewhere, Dallas' Kaplan (voter) said he prefers to avoid forward guidance that ties the hands of future committees Richmond's Barkin (non-voter) said the unemployment rate adjusted for the drop in participation is around 11%. He also estimated 29% of stimulus payments were put into spending.\n\n**Apple's new iPhone gets largely positive reception:**\n\n* Apple (AAPL-US ) on Tuesday unveiled four new iPhone 12 models. While the event was widely previewed and there were relatively few surprises from a specs' standpoint, sell-side commentary still leaned positive. A number of analysts noted that the event further underpinned their expectations for the new models to drive a meaningful upgrade cycle. One of the more upbeat takeaways revolved around lower-than-expected pricing. There was also some positive sentiment surrounding the disclosure that all of the new models will support mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G technology. Carrier promotions were also cited as supportive. In addition, a number of firms discussed how the decision to not include headphones or a power adapter likely helps from both an ESG and gross margin standpoint.\n\n**Hedge fund short sellers target pandemic winners:**\n\n* [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/0a14e904-5fac-41bd-a9b4-a8a588db15c5?segmentId=bf7fa2fd-67ee-cdfa-8261-b2a3edbdf916) discussed how some fund managers are now betting against stocks that benefited on the post-pandemic stay-at-home dynamic (such as home computing, gym equipment, grocery retail and healthcare) in the belief that the boost to company earnings will fade away faster than many investors anticipate. Cited a Goldman Sachs client note which highlighted some of the biggest risk-taking by hedge funds in recent weeks has been in the IT sector, driven by new short positions. Article noted hedge funds have made gains from short positions in companies such as cinema chains, bricks-and-mortar retailers and airlines, betting their earnings would be hammered by lockdown restrictions. However, argued such bets have looked less attractive after sharp price falls, or after governments stepped in to provide support to companies - leading funds to look for other targets.\n\n**White-collar companies increasingly extending work from home timeline:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/technology/offices-reopening-delay-coronavirus.html) discussed how many companies are again delaying return-to-office dates, with the timeline shifting from January to the summer of 2021 at the earliest. Noted that workers say they are in no hurry to get back, with 73% worried that being in their workplace could pose a risk to their personal health and safety. Added that many companies are also pledging to institute permanent work-from-home policies so employees do not ever have to come into the office again. However, also highlighted thoughts that the optimal solution over the longer-term could be a mix of in-person and remote work. Combination of extended work-from-home announcements, adverse coronavirus vaccine and treatment development headlines, and concerns about resurgent case counts have all been cited as factors in latest bout of tech outperformance.", false, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 878947, "public", "self", "Top Market News - Wednesday, Oct. 14, 2020", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jb96o2/top_market_news_wednesday_oct_14_2020/", "all_ads", 6, 1602704677.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "spacej3di", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_kdm2ull", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1602708277, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jb96o2/top_market_news_wednesday_oct_14_2020/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jb96o2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "resources", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "a376614c-65e6-11e5-b6e7-123c7cc7e97b", "link_flair_text": "Resources", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/jb96o2/top_market_news_wednesday_oct_14_2020/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "NdZssKjhf86HIUED1o7iYin-xdadELzfzaC00eWP30c", "resolutions": [{"height": 61, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hkIIpOYENjSFdmIFVuE-Fd87j0hO28xQcNRWHRHU5L0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4758f395f919dc00d42db85a6e55ee7f66bc8c52", "width": 108}, {"height": 123, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hkIIpOYENjSFdmIFVuE-Fd87j0hO28xQcNRWHRHU5L0.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0032ca04a95c53356b6d2218d30a989eb06774b9", "width": 216}, {"height": 182, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hkIIpOYENjSFdmIFVuE-Fd87j0hO28xQcNRWHRHU5L0.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0786326a5438b5a7d64e7479cb1884c489beac4", "width": 320}, {"height": 365, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hkIIpOYENjSFdmIFVuE-Fd87j0hO28xQcNRWHRHU5L0.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3961e3b86c15bf144a30b33106603d276002aad5", "width": 640}, {"height": 548, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hkIIpOYENjSFdmIFVuE-Fd87j0hO28xQcNRWHRHU5L0.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=005aeeba29040a02c4645771b07e85a719579869", "width": 960}, {"height": 617, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hkIIpOYENjSFdmIFVuE-Fd87j0hO28xQcNRWHRHU5L0.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ed7f9288635b937587494feeb66dba6e6a12af2", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 686, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hkIIpOYENjSFdmIFVuE-Fd87j0hO28xQcNRWHRHU5L0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d06cc536cedac006a4f731d52bf5e42effe8fb63", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1602708288, "score": 1, "selftext": "**Sectors were mostly lower with consumer discretionary, communication services weakest groups:**\n\n* Sectors were mostly lower after cautious stimulus commentary, though value group held up better than growth. **Consumer discretionary** was the worst performer, weighed down by AMZN-US , housing retail, footwear and hotels. **Communication services** underperformed with a drag from telecoms and DIS-US giving back some of yesterday's solid gains. **Financials** were behind on sharp declines in money center banks amid WFC-US and BAC-US results. **Healthcare** trailed with managed care weaker (UNH-US results), but hospitals and distributors better. **Consumer staples** in line with beverages, discounters, HPCs, foods modestly lower. **Tech** outperformed with semi-cap (ASML-US results), internet, and services among worst groups. **Energy** gained, following WTI higher, with refiners and services strongest and E&amp;Ps getting an M&amp;A (CXO-US ) boost. **Materials** groups were broadly higher, with precious metals miners, steel and commodity chemicals among bright spots. **Industrials** finished best on strength across transports, machinery, electricals/multis.\n\n**Fiscal stimulus headlines are more noise than news right now:**\n\n* There seems to be more noise than news in the fiscal stimulus headlines in recent days, exacerbating skepticism about the prospects for a deal on a fifth coronavirus relief package.

While the event was widely previewed and there were relatively few surprises from a specs' standpoint, sell-side commentary still leaned positive. A number of analysts noted that the event further underpinned their expectations for the new models to drive a meaningful upgrade cycle. One of the more upbeat takeaways revolved around lower-than-expected pricing. There was also some positive sentiment surrounding the disclosure that all of the new models will support mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G technology. Carrier promotions were also cited as supportive. In addition, a number of firms discussed how the decision to not include headphones or a power adapter likely helps from both an ESG and gross margin standpoint.\n\n**Hedge fund short sellers target pandemic winners:**\n\n* [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/0a14e904-5fac-41bd-a9b4-a8a588db15c5?segmentId=bf7fa2fd-67ee-cdfa-8261-b2a3edbdf916) discussed how some fund managers are now betting against stocks that benefited on the post-pandemic stay-at-home dynamic (such as home computing, gym equipment, grocery retail and healthcare) in the belief that the boost to company earnings will fade away faster than many investors anticipate. Cited a Goldman Sachs client note which highlighted some of the biggest risk-taking by hedge funds in recent weeks has been in the IT sector, driven by new short positions. Article noted hedge funds have made gains from short positions in companies such as cinema chains, bricks-and-mortar retailers and airlines, betting their earnings would be hammered by lockdown restrictions. However, argued such bets have looked less attractive after sharp price falls, or after governments stepped in to provide support to companies - leading funds to look for other targets.\n\n**White-collar companies increasingly extending work from home timeline:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/technology/offices-reopening-delay-coronavirus.html) discussed how many companies are again delaying return-to-office dates, with the timeline shifting from January to the summer of 2021 at the earliest. Noted that workers say they are in no hurry to get back, with 73% worried that being in their workplace could pose a risk to their personal health and safety. Added that many companies are also pledging to institute permanent work-from-home policies so employees do not ever have to come into the office again. However, also highlighted thoughts that the optimal solution over the longer-term could be a mix of in-person and remote work. Combination of extended work-from-home announcements, adverse coronavirus vaccine and treatment development headlines, and concerns about resurgent case counts have all been cited as factors in latest bout of tech outperformance.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 878947, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Top Market News - Wednesday, Oct. 14, 2020", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jb96o2/top_market_news_wednesday_oct_14_2020/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1602704677.0}], [[], false, "spacej3di", null, [], null, "text", "t2_kdm2ull", false, false, [], false, false, 1602688241, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jb2hbp/morning_market_synopsis_wednesday_oct_14_2020/", {}, "jb2hbp", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "resources", [], "a376614c-65e6-11e5-b6e7-123c7cc7e97b", "Resources", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 1, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/jb2hbp/morning_market_synopsis_wednesday_oct_14_2020/", false, 6, 1602688252, 1, "**US equities little changed: Dow +0.07%, S&amp;P 500 +0.09%, Nasdaq +0.09%, Russell 2000 +0.09%**\n\n* US equities little changed in Wednesday midday trading, after opening higher.

It is also expected to be the worst quarter of the pandemic crisis, revealing the extent of the earnings damage as the economy slumped more than 30%.\n*****\n&gt; Major financials JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo are among the financial firms reporting. Pepsico starts off the week with its report Monday, and Johnson and Johnson, Abbott Labs and Netflix also report.\n*****\n&gt; The financial sector is expected to see a more than 52% decline in profits, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cU.S. companies are about to give us a look into their worst quarter since the Great Financial Crisis,\u201d said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. \u201cBut since so many companies aren\u2019t giving earnings forecasts, investors won\u2019t make moves based on earnings alone. They\u2019ll also be looking at trends since the quarter ended. Increasing coronavirus cases, management outlooks, and price performance could all have an outsized impact, and that could lead to outsized market moves.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks turned in a mixed performance in the past week, reacting at times to the rising risks to the economy as coronavirus cases continued to increase in some states. The Dow posted a weekly gain of 0.96% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were up 1.76% and 4.01%, respectively.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, there are some important economic reports, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales Thursday. Last month, retail sales rose a surprise 17.7% but this month economists are watching closely to see if the reversal of some openings and the delays in other is impacting consumer spending.\n*****\n&gt; But it\u2019s the earnings that could be a litmus test for markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it really comes down to earnings, not what the numbers are going to be. People don\u2019t care about the numbers. They want to hear what the companies have to say,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Adivsory Group. \u201cTech companies are going to have the most important earnings. Companies like semiconductors, that go into automobiles, computers and cell phones. They\u2019re the ones that have to say our outlook is great, and therefore our stocks deserve to be at all-time highs.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tech company earnings are only expected to fall by 8%. The worst sectors are expected to be energy, with a decline of 154%, followed by consumer discretionary, expected to be down by 114%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ofauj2F.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AKFxc9T.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/1eL31BE.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/FsCRy91y/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qTpjhn0.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Fc0ZqZt.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Th1egdj.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ml5HLly.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND!)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/yYFhGGwb/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/wMYycqTT/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/XJCBCGWz/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Does a Weak First Six Months Mean Trouble?\n\n&gt; The wild ride of 2020 continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index down 20% in the first quarter and up 20% in the second quarter. Much like dropping a 20 dollar bill and picking it up, this doesn\u2019t mean you are 20 dollars wealthier. Down 20% and then up 20% actually comes out to a 4% drop for the first half of the year.\n\n&gt; What does a negative first half of the year tell us? Turns out, gains could be hard to come by the second half of this year. \u201cAlthough 2020 is like nothing we\u2019ve seen before, the fact of the matter is a weak first half of the year could mean weaker than normal returns for the rest of the year,\u201d according to LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; In fact, the S&amp;P 500 had been higher in the first six months of the year a record nine consecutive years before being lower in 2020. Since 1950, there were 48 times when the first six months were higher and the rest of the year gained 77% of the time and added 5.8% on average those final six months. Compare that with when the first six months of the year were lower 21 times, the final six months were higher only 52% of the time and up only 1.2% on average.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a move higher is quite likely after strength in the first six months of the year, while very modest gains could be in the cards if those first six months underwhelm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.9.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Earnings Season Lurks\n\n&gt; After a relatively quiet week for economic data and practically no earnings reports to speak of, the Q2 earnings season will kick off next week. Normally, earnings season starts quietly with just a handful of reports outside of the major banks, but next week will be relatively busy with some major players on the calendar. Things start off slowly with Pepsi (PEP) on Monday. Tuesday, we\u2019ll get reports from Citigroup (C), Delta (DAL), Fastenal (FAST), JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), all of whom are scheduled to report in the morning. Wednesday\u2019s major reports include Goldman (GS), Progressive (PGR), and UnitedHealth (UNH) in the morning, while Alcoa (AA) will report in the afternoon. Thursday will be the busiest day of the week with too many stocks to list here, but Netflix (NFLX) will highlight the schedule of afternoon reports. Finally, Friday\u2019s key reports include Blackrock (BLK) and State Street (STT).\n\n&gt; As far as analyst sentiment stands heading into the current earnings season, while we wouldn't go so far as to say that it has made a full 180-degree turn from last quarter's negative extremes, it has been close. Over the last four weeks, analysts have raised forecasts for 580 companies in the S&amp;P 1500 and lowered forecasts for 419. That works out to a net of 161 or just under 11% of the index. Besides the S&amp;P 1500, six sectors have positive revisions spreads, while just two are negative. Sectors with the most positive revisions spreads include Consumer Staples, Energy, and Technology, while the two sectors with negative spreads are Financials and Real Estate. Financials just can\u2019t find any love these days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/sectors.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The \"Miracle\" Nasdaq 100\n\n&gt; For anyone unfamiliar with the 1969 Miracle Mets, the \"Amazins\" were 10 games out of first place as late as mid-August and then went on to win 38 out of their last 49 games to finish in first place over the Cubs. From there, the Mets went on to win the first World Series in the history of the franchise in what at the time was one of the biggest turnarounds in the history of baseball. Ironically, in 2007, the Mets were on the other end of another historic turnaround after they blew a seven-game division lead with less than a month left in the season by losing 12 of their last 17 games. But that collapse is a story for another time.\n\n&gt; Like the Miracle Mets in 1969, the Nasdaq 100 in 2020 has also staged a historic turnaround. After trading up over 10% earlier in the year, the gains quickly evaporated with the COVID outbreak. Within two months, the Nasdaq 100 went from a YTD gain of over 10% to a decline of over 20% by late March. From there, though, the Nasdaq has gone on an epic run, not only erasing all of its losses but also trading to record highs and a gain of over 20% on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/2020.png))**\n\n&gt; The frequency of positive days for the Nasdaq 100 provides another illustration of the index's strength this year. So far this year, the index has traded higher on 63% of all trading days. That may not sound like much, but if the year were to end today, it would be the highest percentage of positive days for a given year in the Nasdaq 100's history. On a side note, it's interesting to see in this chart how similar the percentage of positive days has been on a year to year basis over time. There has never been a year where fewer than 46% of all trading days have been positive, and prior to 2020, there has never been a year where more than 62% of all trading days were higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/Winning-Percentage-By-Year.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# China Charges Higher\n\n&gt; We've highlighted the run in Chinese equities quite a lot in the last several days, but it keeps getting more and more extreme. With a gain of over 1% overnight, China's CSI 300 not only turned in its eighth straight day of gains but also its eighth straight day of rallying more than 0.5%. In the history of the CSI 300 dating back to 2002, there has only been one other time where the CSI 300 saw eight or more straight daily gains of 0.5%. That was back in April 2007.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/070920-CSI-300-Streaks.png))**\n\n&gt; If you don't remember what was going on with Chinese equities back in April 2007, take a look at the chart below. The last time the CSI 300 had a streak of 8+ days of 0.5% daily gains, the CSI had already doubled in the prior six months. From there, though, it went on to nearly double again in the next six months. Eventually the bubble burst, and it wasn't much more than a year later that the CSI 300 was back below where it was in April 2007.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/070920-CSI-300.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Cup\n\n&gt; The gold ETF (GLD) has gone through a nine-year drought from new all-time highs, but as it gets closer to its prior highs from September 2011, there are three possible upcoming technical set-ups. The first would be a massive multi-year \"cup and handle\" pattern. You can see the \"cup\" that has been forming over the last nine years. For the \"handle\" to form, GLD would need to go into a sideways consolidation phase from here for a bit. Once that consolidation phase occurs, the pattern would suggest a significant leg higher over potentially years (rather than months).\n\n&gt; The second -- and more negative -- setup would be a bearish \"double top.\" This would happen if GLD gets right up to its highs from September 2011 and fails to break through that resistance\n\n&gt; Finally, the third setup would simply be a breakout higher from here. GLD could simply continue moving higher and break right through resistance at its 2011 high.\n\n&gt; Regardless of what happens, the \"cup\" that has been forming for nearly a decade now is something you don't see often. It will be interesting to watch this pattern from a technical perspective over the next few months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$JPM** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$WFC** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$C** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$JNJ** \n&gt; * **$FAST** \n&gt; * **$GS** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$FRC** \n&gt; * **$TSM** \n&gt; * **$PNC** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$USB** \n&gt; * **$BK** \n&gt; * **$BLK** \n&gt; * **$MS** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$WIT** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$SON** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$AA** \n&gt; * **$SCHW** \n&gt; * **$TFC**\n&gt; * **$ANGO** \n&gt; * **$CFG** \n&gt; * **$BMI** \n&gt; * **$HOMB** \n&gt; * **$ALV** \n&gt; * **$RF** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$SNBR** \n&gt; * **$STT** \n&gt; * **$KSU** \n&gt; * **$JBHT** \n&gt; * **$WNS** \n&gt; * **$KRUS** \n&gt; * **$AMRB** \n&gt; * **$MRTN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/C50RZb0L/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/qRytMj95/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 2 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/XH4RkL4.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Hnhgyk3j/er71320am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKFekV6.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/yYDBz0YR/er71420am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/y6QB5LBB/er71420pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/fT1sW-kJr/er71520am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/zGWry5hX/er71520pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8CmgbHw2/er71620am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/pdHt87QQ/er71620pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Y9Xc5C58/er71720am.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.17.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. $96.27\n&gt; **JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

It is also expected to be the worst quarter of the pandemic crisis, revealing the extent of the earnings damage as the economy slumped more than 30%.\n*****\n&gt; Major financials JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo are among the financial firms reporting. Pepsico starts off the week with its report Monday, and Johnson and Johnson, Abbott Labs and Netflix also report.\n*****\n&gt; The financial sector is expected to see a more than 52% decline in profits, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cU.S. companies are about to give us a look into their worst quarter since the Great Financial Crisis,\u201d said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. \u201cBut since so many companies aren\u2019t giving earnings forecasts, investors won\u2019t make moves based on earnings alone. They\u2019ll also be looking at trends since the quarter ended. Increasing coronavirus cases, management outlooks, and price performance could all have an outsized impact, and that could lead to outsized market moves.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks turned in a mixed performance in the past week, reacting at times to the rising risks to the economy as coronavirus cases continued to increase in some states. The Dow posted a weekly gain of 0.96% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were up 1.76% and 4.01%, respectively.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, there are some important economic reports, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales Thursday. Last month, retail sales rose a surprise 17.7% but this month economists are watching closely to see if the reversal of some openings and the delays in other is impacting consumer spending.\n*****\n&gt; But it\u2019s the earnings that could be a litmus test for markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it really comes down to earnings, not what the numbers are going to be. People don\u2019t care about the numbers. They want to hear what the companies have to say,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Adivsory Group. \u201cTech companies are going to have the most important earnings. Companies like semiconductors, that go into automobiles, computers and cell phones. They\u2019re the ones that have to say our outlook is great, and therefore our stocks deserve to be at all-time highs.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tech company earnings are only expected to fall by 8%. The worst sectors are expected to be energy, with a decline of 154%, followed by consumer discretionary, expected to be down by 114%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ofauj2F.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AKFxc9T.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/1eL31BE.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/FsCRy91y/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qTpjhn0.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Fc0ZqZt.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Th1egdj.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ml5HLly.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND!)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/yYFhGGwb/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/wMYycqTT/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/XJCBCGWz/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Does a Weak First Six Months Mean Trouble?\n\n&gt; The wild ride of 2020 continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index down 20% in the first quarter and up 20% in the second quarter. Much like dropping a 20 dollar bill and picking it up, this doesn\u2019t mean you are 20 dollars wealthier. Down 20% and then up 20% actually comes out to a 4% drop for the first half of the year.\n\n&gt; What does a negative first half of the year tell us? Turns out, gains could be hard to come by the second half of this year. \u201cAlthough 2020 is like nothing we\u2019ve seen before, the fact of the matter is a weak first half of the year could mean weaker than normal returns for the rest of the year,\u201d according to LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; In fact, the S&amp;P 500 had been higher in the first six months of the year a record nine consecutive years before being lower in 2020. Since 1950, there were 48 times when the first six months were higher and the rest of the year gained 77% of the time and added 5.8% on average those final six months. Compare that with when the first six months of the year were lower 21 times, the final six months were higher only 52% of the time and up only 1.2% on average.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a move higher is quite likely after strength in the first six months of the year, while very modest gains could be in the cards if those first six months underwhelm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.9.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Earnings Season Lurks\n\n&gt; After a relatively quiet week for economic data and practically no earnings reports to speak of, the Q2 earnings season will kick off next week. Normally, earnings season starts quietly with just a handful of reports outside of the major banks, but next week will be relatively busy with some major players on the calendar. Things start off slowly with Pepsi (PEP) on Monday. Tuesday, we\u2019ll get reports from Citigroup (C), Delta (DAL), Fastenal (FAST), JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), all of whom are scheduled to report in the morning. Wednesday\u2019s major reports include Goldman (GS), Progressive (PGR), and UnitedHealth (UNH) in the morning, while Alcoa (AA) will report in the afternoon. Thursday will be the busiest day of the week with too many stocks to list here, but Netflix (NFLX) will highlight the schedule of afternoon reports. Finally, Friday\u2019s key reports include Blackrock (BLK) and State Street (STT).\n\n&gt; As far as analyst sentiment stands heading into the current earnings season, while we wouldn't go so far as to say that it has made a full 180-degree turn from last quarter's negative extremes, it has been close. Over the last four weeks, analysts have raised forecasts for 580 companies in the S&amp;P 1500 and lowered forecasts for 419. That works out to a net of 161 or just under 11% of the index. Besides the S&amp;P 1500, six sectors have positive revisions spreads, while just two are negative. Sectors with the most positive revisions spreads include Consumer Staples, Energy, and Technology, while the two sectors with negative spreads are Financials and Real Estate. Financials just can\u2019t find any love these days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/sectors.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The \"Miracle\" Nasdaq 100\n\n&gt; For anyone unfamiliar with the 1969 Miracle Mets, the \"Amazins\" were 10 games out of first place as late as mid-August and then went on to win 38 out of their last 49 games to finish in first place over the Cubs. From there, the Mets went on to win the first World Series in the history of the franchise in what at the time was one of the biggest turnarounds in the history of baseball. Ironically, in 2007, the Mets were on the other end of another historic turnaround after they blew a seven-game division lead with less than a month left in the season by losing 12 of their last 17 games. But that collapse is a story for another time.\n\n&gt; Like the Miracle Mets in 1969, the Nasdaq 100 in 2020 has also staged a historic turnaround. After trading up over 10% earlier in the year, the gains quickly evaporated with the COVID outbreak. Within two months, the Nasdaq 100 went from a YTD gain of over 10% to a decline of over 20% by late March. From there, though, the Nasdaq has gone on an epic run, not only erasing all of its losses but also trading to record highs and a gain of over 20% on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/2020.png))**\n\n&gt; The frequency of positive days for the Nasdaq 100 provides another illustration of the index's strength this year. So far this year, the index has traded higher on 63% of all trading days. That may not sound like much, but if the year were to end today, it would be the highest percentage of positive days for a given year in the Nasdaq 100's history. On a side note, it's interesting to see in this chart how similar the percentage of positive days has been on a year to year basis over time. There has never been a year where fewer than 46% of all trading days have been positive, and prior to 2020, there has never been a year where more than 62% of all trading days were higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/Winning-Percentage-By-Year.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# China Charges Higher\n\n&gt; We've highlighted the run in Chinese equities quite a lot in the last several days, but it keeps getting more and more extreme. With a gain of over 1% overnight, China's CSI 300 not only turned in its eighth straight day of gains but also its eighth straight day of rallying more than 0.5%. In the history of the CSI 300 dating back to 2002, there has only been one other time where the CSI 300 saw eight or more straight daily gains of 0.5%. That was back in April 2007.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/070920-CSI-300-Streaks.png))**\n\n&gt; If you don't remember what was going on with Chinese equities back in April 2007, take a look at the chart below. The last time the CSI 300 had a streak of 8+ days of 0.5% daily gains, the CSI had already doubled in the prior six months. From there, though, it went on to nearly double again in the next six months. Eventually the bubble burst, and it wasn't much more than a year later that the CSI 300 was back below where it was in April 2007.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/070920-CSI-300.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Cup\n\n&gt; The gold ETF (GLD) has gone through a nine-year drought from new all-time highs, but as it gets closer to its prior highs from September 2011, there are three possible upcoming technical set-ups. The first would be a massive multi-year \"cup and handle\" pattern. You can see the \"cup\" that has been forming over the last nine years. For the \"handle\" to form, GLD would need to go into a sideways consolidation phase from here for a bit. Once that consolidation phase occurs, the pattern would suggest a significant leg higher over potentially years (rather than months).\n\n&gt; The second -- and more negative -- setup would be a bearish \"double top.\" This would happen if GLD gets right up to its highs from September 2011 and fails to break through that resistance\n\n&gt; Finally, the third setup would simply be a breakout higher from here. GLD could simply continue moving higher and break right through resistance at its 2011 high.\n\n&gt; Regardless of what happens, the \"cup\" that has been forming for nearly a decade now is something you don't see often. It will be interesting to watch this pattern from a technical perspective over the next few months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$JPM** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$WFC** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$C** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$JNJ** \n&gt; * **$FAST** \n&gt; * **$GS** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$FRC** \n&gt; * **$TSM** \n&gt; * **$PNC** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$USB** \n&gt; * **$BK** \n&gt; * **$BLK** \n&gt; * **$MS** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$WIT** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$SON** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$AA** \n&gt; * **$SCHW** \n&gt; * **$TFC**\n&gt; * **$ANGO** \n&gt; * **$CFG** \n&gt; * **$BMI** \n&gt; * **$HOMB** \n&gt; * **$ALV** \n&gt; * **$RF** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$SNBR** \n&gt; * **$STT** \n&gt; * **$KSU** \n&gt; * **$JBHT** \n&gt; * **$WNS** \n&gt; * **$KRUS** \n&gt; * **$AMRB** \n&gt; * **$MRTN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/C50RZb0L/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/qRytMj95/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 2 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/XH4RkL4.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Hnhgyk3j/er71320am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKFekV6.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/yYDBz0YR/er71420am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/y6QB5LBB/er71420pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/fT1sW-kJr/er71520am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/zGWry5hX/er71520pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8CmgbHw2/er71620am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/pdHt87QQ/er71620pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Y9Xc5C58/er71720am.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.17.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. $96.27\n&gt; **JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

The Nasdaq rose 2.3% in the past week, ending at 9,388.\n*****\n&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse, said the fourth quarter could be a turning point for earnings, after a poor performance in 2019. So far, earnings are down about 0.8% this quarter, based on actual releases and estimates, according to Refinitiv. If not for the drag from energy companies, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies would have been 1.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201c2019 was a year of lousy earnings, and the fourth quarter is the end of a lousy year,\u201d said Golub. \u201cI think earnings surprises will be fine, but what the real story here is, it looks like magically the 2020 numbers are going to be much, much stronger than 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said there are two big themes this earnings season. \u201cThe first one is tech-related companies. Many of the mega caps had okay earnings, but their margins were under a lot of pressure and it subtracted earnings growth in 2019. Those trends are supposed to reverse. So what was a negative because of easy comps becomes a positive,\u201d Golub said. \u201cThe same thing with the energy sector which was a disaster in terms of earnings growth in 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market rally can continue in part because investors are not yet on board with the earnings story.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile everybody is looking at the fourth quarter, I think they\u2019re not really reading the right script, and the script they should be reading was this was the last quarter where tech margins and energy sector headwinds are overwhelming the market,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The hearings on Trump\u2019s impeachment are so far ignored by markets and will be underway in the Senate. While the market continues to shrug it off, traders are monitoring the situation for any change in tone.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWill there be new evidence/witnesses at the Senate trial to make it politically significant?,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Alan Ruskin. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that for many voters, the President seems to be the main motivator for voters on both sides of the political spectrum \u2014 for and against. This argument runs along the lines that Trump is running against himself/\u2018the anti-Trump\u2019, and, the election will be heavily impacted by which Democrat candidate least impacts the \u2018anti-Trump\u2019 vote \u2014 a view that some argue tends to support centrists like Biden.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7YCrtpo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9jQCYRG.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXureFC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/3upRv6z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O07l30Z.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BjiCdpH.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/w5fgr9y.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/L81ewyy.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vroSSfA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MMO35Qf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/dCxJl8u.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading Mixed since 1998, But Improving Lately\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 22 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.79% by DJIA to 0.14% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last eight years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef3ff1e52532ea69e189a7cd90e7b27/bf3ce263396269e9-14/s500x750/4fc5ea153df07c1e2ab94f583409f214f2eae3c6.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Closer Look At Election Years\n\n&gt; 2020 is off to a roaring start, picking up right where 2019 left off. Many investors are eyeing the upcoming presidential election as an impending storm for the stock market. In the four-year presidential cycle, pre-election years have tended to be the strongest for stocks, as sitting presidents have taken measures to boost the economy and stock market higher to garner votes. It sure worked out well last year, with the S&amp;P 500 Index\u2019s 31% total return.\n\n&gt; Returns in election years, however, have been quite bifurcated.\n\n&gt; \u201cIf an incumbent president was up for reelection, stocks tended to do extremely well,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOn the other hand, if there was a lame duck president in office, returns were quite muted.\u201d\n\n&gt; Note that a \u201clame duck president\u201d means the sitting president either isn\u2019t running for reelection or has already fulfilled the maximum two terms. It makes sense, as the president could be less motivated to do things to heat up the economy if they know they are leaving office. Possibly, investors may also get cold feet knowing a change is coming. The S&amp;P 500 was down in 2000 and 2008, and the sitting president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d both years.\n\n&gt; In the LPL Chart of the Day, we break down election years by whether the president was running for reelection or a lame duck. The chart shows the S&amp;P 500 up an impressive 11.7% on average if the President was running for reelection, compared to up an average of 2.4% if president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d.\n\n&gt; Given most presidents who have run a second time have tended to win, this could be the market\u2019s way of saying it is comfortable with the status quo over change.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another encouraging historical trend is that the S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t been lower during an election year with an incumbent president up for reelection since 1940. To be clear, stocks have been up during election years when the incumbent president actually lost. In 1980, the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 26%, but Jimmy Carter still lost to Ronald Reagan. In other words, this does support the notion of higher stocks in 2020, but higher stocks can\u2019t always tell you who will win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Q4 Earnings Season is All About 2020\n\n&gt; Fourth quarter earnings season kicked off this week with 24 S&amp;P 500 Index companies slated to report results. Our expectations are for a marginal increase in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis, based on current FactSet consensus estimates (-2% year over year) and the average historical upside of roughly 3 percentage points.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve become accustomed to meager earnings growth. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if fourth quarter results are anywhere near expectations, 2019 will end up as a year with S&amp;P 500 returns of more than 30% and no corporate earnings growth to speak of. That means expanding stock valuations drove the market\u2019s gains last year, a trend we do not expect to continue.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Earnings-blog-011520-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWe expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWith valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Accordingly, the key to this reporting season will be whether the optimistic growth outlook reflected in consensus earnings estimates for this year remains intact after companies issue guidance. Many companies will be commenting on 2020 for the first time. Our estimate of $175 per share in S&amp;P 500 EPS for the entire year represents a 6\u20137% increase from our $165 forecast for 2019. Based on the latest consensus estimates, that growth rate may get pushed up a bit. We still think $175 is attainable if capital investment picks up after stalling last year and wage growth remains stable.\n\n&gt; Trade progress may help. The United States and China will sign the phase-one trade deal later today. While negotiations on the next phase will be tougher and could even stall out, businesses would welcome the additional clarity that de-escalation can provide, something that clearly weighed on corporate profits last year.\n\n*****\n\n# January Off To Stronger Than Usual Start \u2013 But 2nd Half Is Weaker\n\n&gt; Stocks are off to a stronger that usual so far in January 2020 when compared in the chart above to the average performance over the most recent 21-year period. As of today\u2019s close DJIA is up 1.41%, S&amp;P 500 +1.61%, NASDAQ leads the pack +3.11% and the Russell 2000 was in the red until the past two days and is now up 0.44%. This is well above historical average performance in recent Januarys.\n\n&gt; The market was up nicely today until reports hit the newswires at about 1:30 pm ET creating uncertainty that the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed tomorrow between the US and China may be pabulum. The realization that the tariffs on Chinese goods may remain in place until after the election as the review process runs its course drove stocks lower this afternoon. The market gave back most of its early gains with only the Dow and Russell 2000 eking out gains today.\n\n&gt; However, as you can see in the dotted lines so far in 2020 the indices are tracking the last 21-years rather closely. If the pattern continues to pan out this year, look for a little strength over the next two days. Then weakness has been prone to appear just after mid-month after the eleventh trading day with mild average losses from on or around the eleventh trading day to the fourteenth trading day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2f102c5c61bd803b4bc407e8c4812e3/1b34c8a8e7ad3e39-e9/s500x750/829ff7ea82b52109b737d17e4b24cb0a4d28e434.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Jackpot for Stocks\n\n&gt; Solid across the board gains this year have put another January Trifecta Jackpot in our sights for 2020. So far our January Trifecta is two for two. Our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system came in positive up 0.7% on January 8 following up on a positive reading for our Santa Claus Rally (SCR) on January 3. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month\u2019s end.\n\n&gt; We just published an update on The Incredible January Barometer: Only 11 Major Errors in 82 Years that runs through the reasons behind the efficacy of the January. We discuss how the passage of the Twentieth \u201cLame Duck\u201d Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 created the January Barometer. We also compare the January Barometer results along with the full year results, the following eleven months results, and the subsequent twelve months results to all other \u201cMonthly Barometers\u201d using the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite\n\n&gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table below). In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing \u201cLast 11 Mon\u201d years, in the table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 \u201319.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.\n\n&gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain decent. Of the last 10 times since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.\n\n&gt; A positive SCR and FFD are encouraging and further clarity will be gained when the January Barometer (page 16, 2020 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac) reports at month\u2019s end. A positive January Barometer would certainly boost prospects for full-year 2020. The December Low Indicator (2020 STA, page 34) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow\u2019s December Closing Low of 27502.81 on 12/3/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1bcaf64028a60761e27f90b96cd50a5/be57098a98452149-c8/s500x750/8bde32d516bf2811adabb784ab6de926796ad504.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equities Closing In On A Breakout\n\n&gt; Below is a chart of the Bloomberg World Equity Market index, which is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 publicly listed companies around the world (including the US). While the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 15% from its January 2018 high, it's notable that we still haven't seen equities break out on a global scale. As shown, the Bloomberg World Index is now just a hair below its prior all-time highs (22 basis points to be exact).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-BBG-World.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-SP-5-years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Three Months And Counting Since Last 1% Decline\n\n&gt; It has now been over three months since the S&amp;P 500's last decline of 1% or more back on 10/9. While it seems like an eternity, the current streak of 67 trading days is nowhere near any sort of record on either a long or short-term basis. The chart below shows historical streaks without a decline of 1%+ for the S&amp;P 500 dating back to 1928. The record for the longest streak was back in 1963 when the S&amp;P 500 went 174 trading days - a full eight months - without a 1% drop. Even more impressive is the fact that in both the 1950s and 1960s there were numerous streaks of 100 or more days. For a decade that is looked back on as one with a lot of upheaval in the US, the 1960s was a period of relative calm for the equity market.\n\n&gt; More recently, the current streak of 67 trading days doesn't look all that impressive relative to streaks we saw back in 2017 and 2018. Right after the election in 2016 and into March of 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had a 109-day streak without a 1% decline, and then from late 2017 through January 2018, there was another streak of 112 trading days without a 1% drop. Even in October 2018, there was another streak of 74 trading days. In other words, in just the last three years there have been three longer streaks without a 1% decline than the current one. In the S&amp;P 500's history, there have been 26 other streaks that have been as long or longer than the current one, and half of those went on to last at least 100 trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011420-Streaks-Without-a-1-Percent-Decline.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 17th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$TAL** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$TEAM** \n&gt; * **$KMI** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SWKS** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$MBWM** \n&gt; * **$TXN** \n&gt; * **$COF** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$UNP** \n&gt; * **$AMTD** \n&gt; * **$FNB** \n&gt; * **$SBNY** \n&gt; * **$RCI** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$STM** \n&gt; * **$AUB** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$BKR** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$NAVI** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$APH** \n&gt; * **$NTRS** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$TER** \n&gt; * **$ZION**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/cCUTW9b.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/HZqsu6j.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

Just a few dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report in the four-day trading week, including IBM Tuesday and Intel on Thursday. Johnson &amp; Johnson reports Wednesday; Procter &amp; Gamble is Thursday, and American Express releases results Friday. The stock market is closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump travels to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum, where he speaks Tuesday. With the China trade deal signed this past Wednesday, strategists say they are now watching for any signs of a bigger trade row brewing between the U.S. and Europe.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports, including existing home sales Wednesday; leading indicators Thursday, and the Markit PMI data for manufacturing and services on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; But it\u2019s earnings, where investors will take the pulse of corporate America, and decide whether forward guidance is justifying the stock market\u2019s record highs and price earnings ratio of more than 18.5. The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 2% in the past week, its best week since August. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,329 Friday and is now up about 3% since the start of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow and Nasdaq also ended the week at new highs. The Dow ended up 1.9% for the week, at 29,348. The Nasdaq rose 2.3% in the past week, ending at 9,388.\n*****\n&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse, said the fourth quarter could be a turning point for earnings, after a poor performance in 2019. So far, earnings are down about 0.8% this quarter, based on actual releases and estimates, according to Refinitiv. If not for the drag from energy companies, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies would have been 1.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201c2019 was a year of lousy earnings, and the fourth quarter is the end of a lousy year,\u201d said Golub. \u201cI think earnings surprises will be fine, but what the real story here is, it looks like magically the 2020 numbers are going to be much, much stronger than 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said there are two big themes this earnings season. \u201cThe first one is tech-related companies. Many of the mega caps had okay earnings, but their margins were under a lot of pressure and it subtracted earnings growth in 2019. Those trends are supposed to reverse. So what was a negative because of easy comps becomes a positive,\u201d Golub said. \u201cThe same thing with the energy sector which was a disaster in terms of earnings growth in 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market rally can continue in part because investors are not yet on board with the earnings story.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile everybody is looking at the fourth quarter, I think they\u2019re not really reading the right script, and the script they should be reading was this was the last quarter where tech margins and energy sector headwinds are overwhelming the market,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The hearings on Trump\u2019s impeachment are so far ignored by markets and will be underway in the Senate. While the market continues to shrug it off, traders are monitoring the situation for any change in tone.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWill there be new evidence/witnesses at the Senate trial to make it politically significant?,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Alan Ruskin. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that for many voters, the President seems to be the main motivator for voters on both sides of the political spectrum \u2014 for and against. This argument runs along the lines that Trump is running against himself/\u2018the anti-Trump\u2019, and, the election will be heavily impacted by which Democrat candidate least impacts the \u2018anti-Trump\u2019 vote \u2014 a view that some argue tends to support centrists like Biden.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7YCrtpo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9jQCYRG.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXureFC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/3upRv6z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O07l30Z.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BjiCdpH.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/w5fgr9y.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/L81ewyy.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vroSSfA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MMO35Qf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/dCxJl8u.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading Mixed since 1998, But Improving Lately\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986.

It sure worked out well last year, with the S&amp;P 500 Index\u2019s 31% total return.\n\n&gt; Returns in election years, however, have been quite bifurcated.\n\n&gt; \u201cIf an incumbent president was up for reelection, stocks tended to do extremely well,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOn the other hand, if there was a lame duck president in office, returns were quite muted.\u201d\n\n&gt; Note that a \u201clame duck president\u201d means the sitting president either isn\u2019t running for reelection or has already fulfilled the maximum two terms. It makes sense, as the president could be less motivated to do things to heat up the economy if they know they are leaving office. Possibly, investors may also get cold feet knowing a change is coming. The S&amp;P 500 was down in 2000 and 2008, and the sitting president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d both years.\n\n&gt; In the LPL Chart of the Day, we break down election years by whether the president was running for reelection or a lame duck. The chart shows the S&amp;P 500 up an impressive 11.7% on average if the President was running for reelection, compared to up an average of 2.4% if president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d.\n\n&gt; Given most presidents who have run a second time have tended to win, this could be the market\u2019s way of saying it is comfortable with the status quo over change.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another encouraging historical trend is that the S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t been lower during an election year with an incumbent president up for reelection since 1940. To be clear, stocks have been up during election years when the incumbent president actually lost. In 1980, the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 26%, but Jimmy Carter still lost to Ronald Reagan. In other words, this does support the notion of higher stocks in 2020, but higher stocks can\u2019t always tell you who will win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Q4 Earnings Season is All About 2020\n\n&gt; Fourth quarter earnings season kicked off this week with 24 S&amp;P 500 Index companies slated to report results. Our expectations are for a marginal increase in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis, based on current FactSet consensus estimates (-2% year over year) and the average historical upside of roughly 3 percentage points.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve become accustomed to meager earnings growth. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if fourth quarter results are anywhere near expectations, 2019 will end up as a year with S&amp;P 500 returns of more than 30% and no corporate earnings growth to speak of. That means expanding stock valuations drove the market\u2019s gains last year, a trend we do not expect to continue.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Earnings-blog-011520-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWe expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWith valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Accordingly, the key to this reporting season will be whether the optimistic growth outlook reflected in consensus earnings estimates for this year remains intact after companies issue guidance. Many companies will be commenting on 2020 for the first time. Our estimate of $175 per share in S&amp;P 500 EPS for the entire year represents a 6\u20137% increase from our $165 forecast for 2019. Based on the latest consensus estimates, that growth rate may get pushed up a bit. We still think $175 is attainable if capital investment picks up after stalling last year and wage growth remains stable.\n\n&gt; Trade progress may help. The United States and China will sign the phase-one trade deal later today. While negotiations on the next phase will be tougher and could even stall out, businesses would welcome the additional clarity that de-escalation can provide, something that clearly weighed on corporate profits last year.\n\n*****\n\n# January Off To Stronger Than Usual Start \u2013 But 2nd Half Is Weaker\n\n&gt; Stocks are off to a stronger that usual so far in January 2020 when compared in the chart above to the average performance over the most recent 21-year period. As of today\u2019s close DJIA is up 1.41%, S&amp;P 500 +1.61%, NASDAQ leads the pack +3.11% and the Russell 2000 was in the red until the past two days and is now up 0.44%. This is well above historical average performance in recent Januarys.\n\n&gt; The market was up nicely today until reports hit the newswires at about 1:30 pm ET creating uncertainty that the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed tomorrow between the US and China may be pabulum. The realization that the tariffs on Chinese goods may remain in place until after the election as the review process runs its course drove stocks lower this afternoon. The market gave back most of its early gains with only the Dow and Russell 2000 eking out gains today.\n\n&gt; However, as you can see in the dotted lines so far in 2020 the indices are tracking the last 21-years rather closely. If the pattern continues to pan out this year, look for a little strength over the next two days. Then weakness has been prone to appear just after mid-month after the eleventh trading day with mild average losses from on or around the eleventh trading day to the fourteenth trading day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2f102c5c61bd803b4bc407e8c4812e3/1b34c8a8e7ad3e39-e9/s500x750/829ff7ea82b52109b737d17e4b24cb0a4d28e434.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Jackpot for Stocks\n\n&gt; Solid across the board gains this year have put another January Trifecta Jackpot in our sights for 2020. So far our January Trifecta is two for two. Our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system came in positive up 0.7% on January 8 following up on a positive reading for our Santa Claus Rally (SCR) on January 3. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month\u2019s end.\n\n&gt; We just published an update on The Incredible January Barometer: Only 11 Major Errors in 82 Years that runs through the reasons behind the efficacy of the January. We discuss how the passage of the Twentieth \u201cLame Duck\u201d Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 created the January Barometer. We also compare the January Barometer results along with the full year results, the following eleven months results, and the subsequent twelve months results to all other \u201cMonthly Barometers\u201d using the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite\n\n&gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table below). In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing \u201cLast 11 Mon\u201d years, in the table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 \u201319.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.\n\n&gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain decent. Of the last 10 times since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.\n\n&gt; A positive SCR and FFD are encouraging and further clarity will be gained when the January Barometer (page 16, 2020 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac) reports at month\u2019s end. A positive January Barometer would certainly boost prospects for full-year 2020. The December Low Indicator (2020 STA, page 34) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow\u2019s December Closing Low of 27502.81 on 12/3/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1bcaf64028a60761e27f90b96cd50a5/be57098a98452149-c8/s500x750/8bde32d516bf2811adabb784ab6de926796ad504.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equities Closing In On A Breakout\n\n&gt; Below is a chart of the Bloomberg World Equity Market index, which is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 publicly listed companies around the world (including the US). While the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 15% from its January 2018 high, it's notable that we still haven't seen equities break out on a global scale. As shown, the Bloomberg World Index is now just a hair below its prior all-time highs (22 basis points to be exact).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-BBG-World.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-SP-5-years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Three Months And Counting Since Last 1% Decline\n\n&gt; It has now been over three months since the S&amp;P 500's last decline of 1% or more back on 10/9. While it seems like an eternity, the current streak of 67 trading days is nowhere near any sort of record on either a long or short-term basis. The chart below shows historical streaks without a decline of 1%+ for the S&amp;P 500 dating back to 1928. The record for the longest streak was back in 1963 when the S&amp;P 500 went 174 trading days - a full eight months - without a 1% drop. Even more impressive is the fact that in both the 1950s and 1960s there were numerous streaks of 100 or more days. For a decade that is looked back on as one with a lot of upheaval in the US, the 1960s was a period of relative calm for the equity market.\n\n&gt; More recently, the current streak of 67 trading days doesn't look all that impressive relative to streaks we saw back in 2017 and 2018. Right after the election in 2016 and into March of 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had a 109-day streak without a 1% decline, and then from late 2017 through January 2018, there was another streak of 112 trading days without a 1% drop. Even in October 2018, there was another streak of 74 trading days. In other words, in just the last three years there have been three longer streaks without a 1% decline than the current one. In the S&amp;P 500's history, there have been 26 other streaks that have been as long or longer than the current one, and half of those went on to last at least 100 trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011420-Streaks-Without-a-1-Percent-Decline.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 17th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$TAL** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$TEAM** \n&gt; * **$KMI** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SWKS** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$MBWM** \n&gt; * **$TXN** \n&gt; * **$COF** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$UNP** \n&gt; * **$AMTD** \n&gt; * **$FNB** \n&gt; * **$SBNY** \n&gt; * **$RCI** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$STM** \n&gt; * **$AUB** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$BKR** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$NAVI** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$APH** \n&gt; * **$NTRS** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$TER** \n&gt; * **$ZION**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/cCUTW9b.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/HZqsu6j.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.
