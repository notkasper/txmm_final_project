This is my personal observation. \n\nTo make the post more interesting let me introduce a grading or tier system for Alphabets various products\n\nTier 1 - Supreme Monopoly\n\nTier 2 - Monopoly but competition exist \n\nTier 3 - Excellent market share but not a monopoly \n\nTier 4 - Good market share but somewhat far from the big boys\n\nTier 5 - Decent market share and significantly far away from the mainstream products. \n\nTier 6 - Future Potential\n\nYesterday, GOOGL closed at 1757.76 and GOOG closed at 1758.72. Current P/E ratio is 35.42 and 35.47 respectively. S&amp;P 500 average P/E ratio at market close is at 37.56. Cheap tech stock what! \n\nI am gonna try my best to justify why Alphabet is that one stock you buy and hold forever, Alphabet is a safe bet, pun intended.\u00a0\n\nAs mentioned above, we will divide Alphabet into levels or tiers, with tier 1 product being the supreme one, supreme product is something that is irreplaceable and competition is not possible unless a company messes it up themself.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA company is absolutely safe for investment if they have a moat that is almost impossible to beat. For example, Amazon! there online retail business is almost impossible to beat. Because investment alone won't be enough to out do what they have achieved, amazon has amazing delivery time logistics, lots of products and so on.\u00a0\n\nThen there are monopolies that a competitor can challenge for example google maps! we have apple maps and recently amazon announced AWS maps for company use.\u00a0\n\nSo what does Alphabet has that is unbeatable that is Level 1.\u00a0\n\n you might think ''google search'', but the\u00a0\n\nanswer is Youtube.\u00a0\n\nYoutube is a beast like no other, the thing is a product becomes indispensable when money is not the only investment involved. Billions of hours of our lives is on this platform. From tutorials to how to videos to live shows to TV shows to News Channels to personal video to everythinggggggg. Youtube is essential and no matter how much money a competitor throws for a competing product it aint gonna be worth it because not only it will be extremely expensive to set up the data centres required and to maintain at the level of Youtube but more importantly you are also relying on people to invest there time in it in the form of uploads and to ditch an established streaming service in favour of something new.\u00a0A variable not in your control. Based on this absolute monopoly alone that very few companies in the world possess Alphabet is a buy and hold forever! \n\nIn contrast Google search for example is a monopoly at the moment and probably will always remain the number 1 search platform in the world but companies left and right release competitive products such as bing because the only investment required here is money.\u00a0\n\nAnd Youtube has not achieved its full potential yet, there is still room for growth, especially as it moves towards a subscription based model and then you have the Youtube TV/Google TV product in USofA, wait till that becomes mainstream.\u00a0\n\nI think inn the near Future streaming services like Netflix, Disney plus, Prime TV on one side and Youtube alone on other side (because there is no one like Youtube) will dominate and TV channels will slowly get absorb into them.\u00a0 \n\nNow what about Alphabets other monopolies: Google search, Chrome, Android, Google maps, Gmail. I mean they are the best products in what they offer but they have pretty good competition namely bing, internet explorer/Firefox (love chrome as it over took Internet explorer), iOS, Apple maps, outlook. But having said that these products are likely to lead their respective markets although they will share the customers with their competitors. All of these products are monopoly level products but given they have good competition we label them as Level 2 product. \n\nNow let's talk about tier 3 products. Again these are the products that are extremely good but the market leader is someone else. Alphabet has amazing products in this tier that are providing revenues in the billions such as Google Cloud Platform(GCP) on one hand and on the other extreme with modest revenue Google Nest products. \n\nGCP is too big to be named in the same breadth as the other products here, the revenue that GCP\u00a0 is projected to grow is significant, especially in comparison to other Alphabet revenue sources. If you look at the last quarter, 2020 Q3, GCP brought in 3.44 billion dollars, this is a 45% year over year growth in GCP revenue! pretty sweet; plus by 2025 Cloud market is projected to triple in revenue and hence GCP will be responsible for a bigger chunk of the parent company's revenue, currently it sits around 10% of the total revenue.\n\n Other products at level 3 includes google sheets/slides/docs (An excellent alternative to MS office. Its free! but it's unlikely to challenge Microsoft's monopoly in this regard. Office is such a strong moat even though it is a paid service, google sheets etc will likely remain number 2 in this game)\n\n please note Many of Google products come under the domain of Android and I have made a conscious effort to not name them separately unless they have a massive presence of their own.\n\n another notable entry here, in the near future, will be the fitbit smartwatch (Once that long awaited deal goes through World wide) \u00a0\n\nNow we bring our attention to tier 4 products. Again these are those products that are pretty good but are slightly far away at the moment from the main competition. This includes other Google hardware products such as Chromebooks and Pixel Phones. I am sure it won't be long before these products will move up to Level 3 but are unlikely to gain significant market share in the presence of Apple and Samsung. \n\nLevel 5 includes those products that are far away from the main competing brands, a good example includes the Stadia. Which, frankly speaking is amazing but is very unlikely to reach the likes of Nintendo, Microsoft or Sony. Unless Alphabet buys big developers or something. \n\nLevel 6 includes those potential products that might have a huge impact in the future, obviously we are talking about Alphabets moonshot division X. X has a lot of projects, I will briefly touch 4 of them. Waymo is the front runner here, followed by Verily, Deepmind and Quantum computer.\u00a0\n\nWaymo main competition I think is Tesla. Not sure who is gonna come on top but one thing is for sure Waymo will have a significant market share. \n\nVerily is all about using Alphabets massive data for medicine, and Pharmaceutical companies are already paying verily for it's data to fine tune there future products. \n\nDeepmind another example of Alphabet's commitment to medicine, using Alphabet AI research to predict how a protein folds. Leading to a new chapter of medicine research and development. \n\nFinally and the project that is in it's infancy. Quantum computing is as fantastic, as tremendous as Elon's SpaceX mission to Mars. It will be at least a decade before we start understanding and making products with QC. But if successful, it will have the highest potential out of all X's projects. \n\nIf Alphabets projected is achieved than EPS will likely double in around 5-6 years time. Stock price should at least double as well. \n\nThere you have it folks.

I expect to keep these investments for at least 10+ years. That said, I would really appreciate it if anyone could provide insights on the plans I thought of.\n\n1. I saw many posts/comments suggesting young people go more growth-focused. I was considering to research more on All-Weather Portfolio, bonds ETF, and high Dividend ETFs (VYM and O). Considering I plan on 10+yrs of investing, I planned to have 20% bonds/gold ETF 10% dividend ETF and 70% stock/etfs. \n2. As much as I'm a cs major, I'm very interested in the tech industry. However, I am hesitant of buying NVDA, APPL, GOOG, AMZN, etc right now as I believe there's at least some bubble in those stocks.

I expect to keep these investments for at least 10+ years. That said, I would really appreciate it if anyone could provide insights on the plans I thought of.\n\n1. I saw many posts/comments suggesting young people go more growth-focused. I was considering to research more on All-Weather Portfolio, bonds ETF, and high Dividend ETFs (VYM and O). Considering I plan on 10+yrs of investing, I planned to have 20% bonds/gold ETF 10% dividend ETF and 70% stock/etfs. \n2. As much as I'm a cs major, I'm very interested in the tech industry.

I also plan to invest in a few more ETF's but since they're a bit pricey rn I'm not sure which ones to invest in.\n\nOriginal Brokerage Account:\n\nDIS (1) +$56.17\n\nNFLX (1) +$188.62\n\nHON (1) +$42.40\n\nAAPL (7) +$257.88\n\nMSFT (1) +$31.99\n\nCOST (1) +$54.20\n\nAMZN ($589 partial share) +86.55\n\nCTAS (1) +$116.02\n\nGOOG (partial share) +$20.06\n\nFDX ($46 partial share) +$4.61\n\nBLFS (10) +$104.69\n\nVLRS (10) +$12.93\n\nGDRX (4) -$14.32\n\nDGX (1) -$1.59\n\nSGC (4) -$11.64\n\nQCLN (3) +$35.37\n\nPAYX (1) +$4.89\n\nHD (1) -$5.88\n\nLOW (1) +$2.81\n\nBJ (2) -$6.82\n\nSCHN (3) +$16.53\n\nADP (1) +$2.85\n\nAGI (free)\n\nZNGA (free)\n\nSWN (free)\n\n\nNew Brokerage Account:\n\nAAPL (1) +$4.19\n\nABBV (2) +$7.80\n\nALB (1) +$8.07\n\nAMZN ($127 partial share) +2.52\n\nBEP (1) +$0.14\n\nENPH (2) +$105.56\n\nMMEDF (84) +$8.40\n\nNIO (10) +$30.02\n\nNTDOY (3) +$24.14\n\nPLTR (4) -$3.05\n\nSOL (25) +$111.00\n\nSQ (1) +$28.26\n\nWM (1) -$0.71\n\nWMT ($122 partial share) -2.87\n\nETF's:\n\nICLN (8) +$36.00\n\nKGRN (5) +27.10\n\nROBO (1) +3.33\n\nSBIO (2) +7.78\n\nTAN (2) +50.84", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 981859, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Portfolio advice?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/khxmi5/portfolio_advice/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1608606080.0}], [[], false, "Etoro-Partners", null, [], null, "text", "t2_9e9j5qp3", false, false, [], false, false, 1608587895, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/khraxh/top_stocks_holding_2020/", {}, "khraxh", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "tickernews", [], "5a4c814a-65e6-11e5-b65e-122ab0778f8b", "Ticker News", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 1, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/khraxh/top_stocks_holding_2020/", false, 6, 1608587907, 1, "Tesla is now officially in the S&amp;P500.

These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to \u2018drift\u2019 for the next hour or more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.\n\n\\---\n\n3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big \u201cShake-out\u201d points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It\u2019s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or \u201ccross\u201d. \n\nTrade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade\n\n1.    Portfolio fit \u2013 Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.\n\n2.    Liquidity Check \u2013 If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance \u2013 look for \u201cAverage Volume.\u201d Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest \u2013 this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.\n\n3.    IV Percentile  \u2013 Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it\u2019s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it\u2019s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it\u2019s current volatility is low \u2013 and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.\n\n4.    Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.\n\n5.    Strike Price \u2013 First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity \u2013 delta \u2013 to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well \u2013 higher intrinsic value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.\n\n6.    Expiration \u2013 Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock  meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta \u2013 a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date \u2013 your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.\n\n7.    Position size \u2013 This is important \u2013 BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It\u2019s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.\n\n8.    Future moves \u2013 Think beyond what\u2019s going on with a stock than just in the current day \u2013 unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don\u2019t rush your entry \u2013 You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I\u2019d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day.

These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to \u2018drift\u2019 for the next hour or more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.\n\n\\---\n\n3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big \u201cShake-out\u201d points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It\u2019s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or \u201ccross\u201d. \n\nTrade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade\n\n1.    Portfolio fit \u2013 Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.\n\n2.    Liquidity Check \u2013 If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance \u2013 look for \u201cAverage Volume.\u201d Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest \u2013 this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.\n\n3.    IV Percentile  \u2013 Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it\u2019s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it\u2019s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it\u2019s current volatility is low \u2013 and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.\n\n4.    Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.\n\n5.    Strike Price \u2013 First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity \u2013 delta \u2013 to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well \u2013 higher intrinsic value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.\n\n6.    Expiration \u2013 Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock  meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta \u2013 a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date \u2013 your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.\n\n7.    Position size \u2013 This is important \u2013 BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It\u2019s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.\n\n8.    Future moves \u2013 Think beyond what\u2019s going on with a stock than just in the current day \u2013 unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don\u2019t rush your entry \u2013 You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I\u2019d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them.\n\nThis is a write-up i did today to assist beginners AND experienced traders with understanding everything that needs to be understood in the markets.

I just wanted to share my thoughts on $TSLA long term!\n\n\n\n ________\n______________\n\n\n**Why I am extremely bullish**:\n\n1. I studied engineering in college like Musk (actually he was in physics, but in a related, relevant field) and the concept of ethics + morality is emphasized &amp; deemed imperative throughout engineering + physics classes / seminars / programs. I kinda obsessed over Musk this past year to try and understand his persona and character and thought-process and watched any interview I could find online, read his articles, watched live events, read reviews from past/current employees. It was pretty evident that this guy is interested in bettering the world (reducing emissions, decreasing dependence on foreign oil &amp; drilling, self-sustainability in homes, and more). From what I gathered, he genuinely believes in Tesla's mission statement and most importantly, is confident in delivering. Perhaps this is too anecdotal and emotional to have any real bearing, but I am bullish on companies motivated by the bigger picture (in this case energy).\n\n2. He has largely been focused on growth over profit, and this is the only correct approach IMO to running a company that is tasked with introducing ground-breaking, societal-changing, futuristic technology to the world. ***Here are some of Tesla's major costs***:\nTraining a neural network to read the road like a human takes an extraordinary amount of resources. You want the AI to have seen every damn inch of the Earth so it has exposure to different variabilities while driving and makes the safe, correct maneuver.  Another is investing in producing in-house batteries. Another is upgrading its facilities to better streamline production and increase efficiency. Another is expanding its facilities themselves across the world like Germany for example and then domestically like the giga in Texas. Another is solar technology. None of this stuff is profitable right now. No one is paying Tesla for its efforts in optimizing the AI or for any of its other endeavors I just mentioned. They have a 35K car (model 3) to get an EV out there many can afford and thus build a reputation in the public of a working model..... its not to earn profits. Tesla is focusing on solidifying its foundations now so that it can be profitable in the (increasingly near) future. \n\n3. Let's talk about the super high P/E value for $TSLA stock. Stock price keeps rising, but earnings stay low. This is the primary metric used by the $TSLA bears suggesting the stock is overvalued and in a bubble that's about to burst. But if you agree with the points I made in #2 above, you can understand why the profits are low. $AMZN had a period with a P/E of 1000+. In the ensuing years, though, its P/E came back down to more normal levels, but the stock price kept rising. Why? Because their earnings started to increase. And this is why it takes a believer and due diligence to invest in this stock. Do you understand why Tesla is focusing on growth over profits right now? Do you believe that it can overcome challenges to produce a dope product (and service)? If you say no - then you are fine to think the P/E ratio is too damn high and you should not invest long term. But if you do your research, agree with their approach, and believe that Tesla is going to become a highly profitable company, then who fucking cares about the P/E ratio! Earnings will come and the P/E value will become averaged and normal while price will also increase. \n\n4. There's the mandate to cease ICE vehicle production by 2030-2035. It's a (largely) global mandate and so when that time comes, you're going to have to buy an EV. Which guy do you think will have the most refined product? GM, Porshe, Volkswagen? Or Tesla, that has ***solely*** focused on EV for its lifespan? Do you believe other companies can just magically catch-up and be on par with Tesla experience-wise? Keep in mind that many auto companies are being forced into EV. Watch some (not so) old videos of GM mechanics &amp; engineers who proudly tout their gas-operated ICEs and mock EVs like its some ridiculous technology. Can you really believe that despite all these disadvantages, these same guys can produce a product superior to Tesla? Do you feel comfortable trusting a product with significantly lesser testing time than one who has been at it for years longer?\n\n5. Autonomous driving. I keep reading that all the auto dealers can easily \"catch-up to the new EV technology\" to be on par with Tesla's EV (which btw doesn't really make sense to me). But for fun let's say that somehow it happened. Autonomous FSD needs to be tested thoroughly to be deemed safe for public use. Won't that take years of trial and error and testing and more beta testing and changes and recalls and delays? Like many of you, I've watched the FSD beta videos for Tesla street driving AI. It is nothing short of incredible. Yes of-course there are problems, though, and they are being worked on. This is all a normal R&amp;D procedure for FSD that any car dealer must complete before releasing to the public. How in the world can they catch-up so quickly then?\n\n6. As we have heard from the bulls (*maybe* *too many* *times...*), Tesla isn't just a car company. Its mission is to reduce emissions, increase self-sustainability (with solar panels for homes, cars), and revolutionize the electric grid with distributing solar power. Also they sell these really comfy ass shorts. Does GM sell comfy shorts? I'll wait.\n\n\n_________________\n\n_____\n\n**Things that make me doubt Tesla:**\n\n1. (this one is simply conjecture, not fact-based). A reduction in enthusiasm / effort towards Tesla from Elon Musk due to having to manage all of his other endeavors. If SpaceX, Starlink go public causing his workload to multiply, can we still expect Tesla leadership to run the company with the same drive and motivation?\n\n2. I keep reading stories and reviews of Tesla cars that need to go in for repairs shorty after being purchased. Seat issues, door issues, tires falling out. My neighbor bought a Model Y and said he had to take it back the first week because there was problems with the seat not moving or something. He did say that after the repair, the car has been perfect and he'll never go back to an ICE. Still, pretty concerning that so much random shit seems to happen right outta the box. \n\n3. Even if they become the sole clear-cut leader in EV auto vehicles (2030), can we justify a market cap that compares to $AMZN or $GOOG or $MSFT or $AAPL? What if they also became the primary all-purpose electric energy solution for residence / commercial sectors? \n\n______\n_____\n\n\n**In summary,** I totally understand the doubts and uncertainties that many people have with buying $TSLA stock, and even Tesla cars. Many investors see the P/E value and call it inflated / in a bubble. Folks, this is futuristic, groundbreaking and developing technology. Perhaps, just maybe, there are other metrics to gauge a stock then? I recommend reading Tesla's engineering news, not just financial reports, to gain a clearer picture. Due to some of Musk's social media antics, the stock has become a meme stock / robinhooders joke stock (lol). All this time that Tesla invests into its growth and R&amp;D (instead of profits), will pave the way for it to produce a leading, refined product in the EV sector. And yes, I did read Elon's email about profits earlier today. \n\nPlease share your thoughts.

Roblox RBLX acknowledged in its official paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it is experiencing a huge boost from users isolated during shelter-in-place policies related to coronavirus, but seeks to appeal to a wider, and older, audience to continue growing when things go back to \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nRoblox originally filed for an IPO on Nov. 19, after disclosing a month before that it was beginning the process. Roblox said in the original filing that it sought to raise up to $1 billion; this figure is typically a placeholder that will be updated in later filings, but suggests a larger fundraising goal than the typical large IPO, which uses a $100 million target.\n\nRoblox expects to trade under the ticker \u201cRBLX\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange. There are six banks underwriting the deal, led by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and J.P. Morgan. 2020 has been a good year for IPOs with the Renaissance IPO ETF IPO up 94% for the year to date, compared with a 12% gain in the S&amp;P 500 index SPX , and a 35% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP .\n\nHere are five things to know about Roblox as it becomes a public company.\n\n1. If you don\u2019t have tweens, you\u2019ve probably never heard of it\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of Roblox, you probably haven\u2019t been around a pre-teen much in recent years. The company said that more than half of its 31.1 million daily users are younger than 13 years old. Back in 2018, the service claimed about 12 million daily users.\n\nSince most online accounts require users to be at least 13, the company has faced criticism for inappropriate content on its service. In the prospectus, Roblox said it uses a human review team to screen content and has reviewed more than 68 million \u201cassets\u201d in the first nine months, and has \u201chad a human respond\u201d to more than 9 million customer inquiries within 10 minutes on average. The company hopes to appeal to older users and to retain current users as they grow up.\n\n\u201cWe ultimately aim to be a brand that serves all ages,\u201d the company said in its SEC filing. \u201cAn early sign of what is possible: our 17 to 24-year-old user age group grew faster than our core under 13 age group in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u201d\n\n2. COVID-19 generated a huge boost of traffic\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, Roblox growth exploded as tweens and others who were sheltering in place flocked to the online community. The number of daily users surged 82% over the past 12 months and the average user was on the service for more than two-and-a-half hours a day.\n\n\u201cWe have experienced rapid growth \u2026 given our users have been online more as a result of global COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies,\u201d the company said.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2020, Roblox said DAUs, or daily average users, grew to 31.1 million from 17.1 million in the same period during 2019. Year-over-year, Roblox reported 17.6 million DAUs in 2019, compared with 12 million in 2018.\n\nSimilarly, total hours spent on Roblox more than doubled to 22.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with 10 billion in the same period in 2019. Year-over-year, users spent 13.7 billion hours on Roblox in 2019, versus 9.4 billion in 2018.\n\n3. Its revenue is derived from the model that has Epic Games fighting Apple\n\nRoblox makes money by using a virtual currency called \u201cRobux\u201d that users buy to upgrade avatar and make purchases, but that developers also use within the platform. That means Roblox pays a lot of money to third-party distributors like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. at a time when those practices are being disputed by others.\n\nBack in August, the popular videogame \u201cFortnite,\u201d made by Epic Games, was banned from Apple\u2019s AAPL App Store and Alphabet\u2019s GOOG GOOGL Google Play stores because Epic tried to work around the 30% cuts the companies were getting from in-game purchases, and loudly disputed the practice.\n\nRoblox said it also pays 30% of its one-time purchases to both Apple and Google when they are made on the respective stores. The company said for the first nine months of 2020, 34% of its revenue came from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases. That\u2019s compared with 30% of revenue from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases in 2019.\n\nThe company said its bookings surged 171% to $1.24 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with $458 million in the same period in 2019. From 2018 to 2019, bookings grew 39%. If defines bookings as \u201csales of our virtual currency which we record as deferred revenue and then recognize that revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user.\u201d\n\nBooking per DAU rose to $39.93 in the first nine months of 2020 from $26.75 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIn a nod to COVID-19\u2019s part in the surge, the company said: \u201cWe do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline.\u201d\n\n4. As revenue has soared, losses have widened\n\nWhile Roblox reported a 68% surge in revenue for the first nine months of 2020, losses for the period more than quadrupled.\n\nRoblox reported revenue of $588.7 million and a loss of $203.2 million in the period, compared with $349.9 million in revenue and a loss of $46.3 million for the first nine months of 2019. Roblox reported revenue of$488.2 million and a narrower loss of $86 million in 2019, compared with revenue of $312.8 million and a loss of $97.2 million in 2018.\n\nThe biggest culprits in 2020\u2019s widening loss were payments to content developers and administration fees connected with the run up to the IPO.\n\n\u201cDeveloper exchange fees track closely with our overall bookings performance as more users on the platform and Robux purchased by our users drives more Robux earned by developers and creators,\u201d the company said in its filing.\n\nThose fees soared 190% to $209.2 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared with the same period a year ago.\n\nIn the same period, general and administrative fees soared 125% to $64.9 million. While $27.7 million of that increase was due to higher personnel costs including stock-based compensation expenses, the company also cited \u201can increase in headcount in our finance, accounting, people, IT and legal functions associated with our anticipated public offering.\u201d\n\n5. Early investors get a big upper hand\n\nThe IPO is for Class A shares, which get one vote per share, as opposed to Class B shares that get 20 votes per share and are convertible to Class A shares.\n\nThose Class B shares belong mostly to early investors, the first of which were Altos Ventures and First Round Capital. Altos has a 23.9% stake in the company with 114.3 million shares and First Round has a 7% stake with 33.6 million shares.\n\nLater investors include Meritech Capital Partners and Index Ventures. Meritech owns an 11.6% stake at 55.3 million shares, while Index has an 11.1% stake at 53.1 million shares.\n\nTiger Global Management, which entered the picture in 2018, has an 8.2% stake at 39.3 million shares.\n\nEarlier in the year, Andreessen Horowitz led a $150 million investment round in the company but doesn\u2019t even break into the list of \u201cgreater than 5%\u201d stockholders. \n\n[Source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/roblox-ipo-5-things-to-know-about-the-tween-centric-gaming-platform-11606499231)", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 931861, "public", "self", "Roblox IPO: 5 things to know about the tween-centric gaming platform", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k286yz/roblox_ipo_5_things_to_know_about_the/", "all_ads", 6, 1606502790.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Brothanogood", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_d29iz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606506390, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k286yz/roblox_ipo_5_things_to_know_about_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k286yz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "news", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "866eb162-65e6-11e5-a903-1252b640afe9", "link_flair_text": "News", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 62, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/k286yz/roblox_ipo_5_things_to_know_about_the/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "tpIMnlKEYIYYx2yRVynuo1qbcZxnAK9Myre0GAWUGi4", "resolutions": [{"height": 54, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ba8c59d74e8ff6e92f6ac36181a0b05bec1d4a3", "width": 108}, {"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11dd624a0f2c6cf9001ea1c3cabafd71efedc018", "width": 216}, {"height": 160, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bac411c45daeb5adf984022b95fa39bf4cdf3721", "width": 320}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cc34167a5424a2b3dd89482d4d374b73a1b2e67", "width": 640}, {"height": 480, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c75ba6b59a03006dd5447e0a903e54b185e86562", "width": 960}, {"height": 540, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1116b460b4deec6c16b600251673f6bef66a9536", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 640, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b4b2253c418f739208498d73d43dd9966967519d", "width": 1280}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1606506401, "score": 1, "selftext": "Roblox Corp. is planning an initial public offering amid strong momentum as millions of tweens and teenagers are glued to their mobile devices during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe San Mateo, Calif.-based gaming platform features a variety of \u201c3-D digital worlds\u201d that are built by users and developers, providing virtual communities where users can play with friends. Roblox RBLX acknowledged in its official paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it is experiencing a huge boost from users isolated during shelter-in-place policies related to coronavirus, but seeks to appeal to a wider, and older, audience to continue growing when things go back to \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nRoblox originally filed for an IPO on Nov. 19, after disclosing a month before that it was beginning the process. Roblox said in the original filing that it sought to raise up to $1 billion; this figure is typically a placeholder that will be updated in later filings, but suggests a larger fundraising goal than the typical large IPO, which uses a $100 million target.\n\nRoblox expects to trade under the ticker \u201cRBLX\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange. There are six banks underwriting the deal, led by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and J.P. Morgan. 2020 has been a good year for IPOs with the Renaissance IPO ETF IPO up 94% for the year to date, compared with a 12% gain in the S&amp;P 500 index SPX , and a 35% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP .\n\nHere are five things to know about Roblox as it becomes a public company.\n\n1. If you don\u2019t have tweens, you\u2019ve probably never heard of it\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of Roblox, you probably haven\u2019t been around a pre-teen much in recent years. The company said that more than half of its 31.1 million daily users are younger than 13 years old. Back in 2018, the service claimed about 12 million daily users.\n\nSince most online accounts require users to be at least 13, the company has faced criticism for inappropriate content on its service. In the prospectus, Roblox said it uses a human review team to screen content and has reviewed more than 68 million \u201cassets\u201d in the first nine months, and has \u201chad a human respond\u201d to more than 9 million customer inquiries within 10 minutes on average. The company hopes to appeal to older users and to retain current users as they grow up.\n\n\u201cWe ultimately aim to be a brand that serves all ages,\u201d the company said in its SEC filing. \u201cAn early sign of what is possible: our 17 to 24-year-old user age group grew faster than our core under 13 age group in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u201d\n\n2. COVID-19 generated a huge boost of traffic\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, Roblox growth exploded as tweens and others who were sheltering in place flocked to the online community. The number of daily users surged 82% over the past 12 months and the average user was on the service for more than two-and-a-half hours a day.\n\n\u201cWe have experienced rapid growth \u2026 given our users have been online more as a result of global COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies,\u201d the company said.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2020, Roblox said DAUs, or daily average users, grew to 31.1 million from 17.1 million in the same period during 2019. Year-over-year, Roblox reported 17.6 million DAUs in 2019, compared with 12 million in 2018.\n\nSimilarly, total hours spent on Roblox more than doubled to 22.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with 10 billion in the same period in 2019. Year-over-year, users spent 13.7 billion hours on Roblox in 2019, versus 9.4 billion in 2018.\n\n3. Its revenue is derived from the model that has Epic Games fighting Apple\n\nRoblox makes money by using a virtual currency called \u201cRobux\u201d that users buy to upgrade avatar and make purchases, but that developers also use within the platform. That means Roblox pays a lot of money to third-party distributors like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. at a time when those practices are being disputed by others.\n\nBack in August, the popular videogame \u201cFortnite,\u201d made by Epic Games, was banned from Apple\u2019s AAPL App Store and Alphabet\u2019s GOOG GOOGL Google Play stores because Epic tried to work around the 30% cuts the companies were getting from in-game purchases, and loudly disputed the practice.\n\nRoblox said it also pays 30% of its one-time purchases to both Apple and Google when they are made on the respective stores. The company said for the first nine months of 2020, 34% of its revenue came from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases. That\u2019s compared with 30% of revenue from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases in 2019.\n\nThe company said its bookings surged 171% to $1.24 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with $458 million in the same period in 2019. From 2018 to 2019, bookings grew 39%. If defines bookings as \u201csales of our virtual currency which we record as deferred revenue and then recognize that revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user.\u201d\n\nBooking per DAU rose to $39.93 in the first nine months of 2020 from $26.75 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIn a nod to COVID-19\u2019s part in the surge, the company said: \u201cWe do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline.\u201d\n\n4. As revenue has soared, losses have widened\n\nWhile Roblox reported a 68% surge in revenue for the first nine months of 2020, losses for the period more than quadrupled.\n\nRoblox reported revenue of $588.7 million and a loss of $203.2 million in the period, compared with $349.9 million in revenue and a loss of $46.3 million for the first nine months of 2019. Roblox reported revenue of$488.2 million and a narrower loss of $86 million in 2019, compared with revenue of $312.8 million and a loss of $97.2 million in 2018.\n\nThe biggest culprits in 2020\u2019s widening loss were payments to content developers and administration fees connected with the run up to the IPO.\n\n\u201cDeveloper exchange fees track closely with our overall bookings performance as more users on the platform and Robux purchased by our users drives more Robux earned by developers and creators,\u201d the company said in its filing.\n\nThose fees soared 190% to $209.2 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared with the same period a year ago.\n\nIn the same period, general and administrative fees soared 125% to $64.9 million. While $27.7 million of that increase was due to higher personnel costs including stock-based compensation expenses, the company also cited \u201can increase in headcount in our finance, accounting, people, IT and legal functions associated with our anticipated public offering.\u201d\n\n5.

Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus \n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until \u201cat least 2023\u201d. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed\u2019s monetary support. In early October, Powell said, \u201ctoo little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000. While this estimate would the sixth month of net payroll gains, it would also be the four, straight month of deceleration, indicating the pace of recovery is slowing. The unemployment rate is also predicted to tick lower, from 7.9% to 7.6%. However, worryingly, there appears to be a trend towards long-term unemployment for many Americans. The number of individuals filing continuing claims, people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, has continued to increase the past several weeks. This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly.\n\nThe US just set a new record for the highest seven-day average of daily new cases: 81,336 as of Sunday. That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has increased only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project. \n\nLast week, Europe recorded around 1.5 million new cases of coronavirus, a new record, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. England, in response to the surge, announced a nationwide lockdown for at least the next four weeks.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday an event for Nov. 10 where it\u2019s expected to announce new Macs that are powered by their own chips powered by ARM processors, instead of the Intel chips it had been using. Could impact Nvidia (NVDA) stock, which owns ARM chips, and Intel, who has not been doing very well lately, judging from last earnings report and stock price action (INTC).\n* Images for the updated Tesla Cybertruck could come next Musk, according to CEO Elon Musk.\n* Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO announced its October deliveries, and the number has shares on the move, again. NIO delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, doubling from a year ago. The result is doubly impressive because NIO very recently raised its manufacturing capacity to 5,000 vehicles a month.

Volatility has dominated markets in the last few weeks, with investors spooked by the uncertainty of the US presidential elections, a record number of coronavirus infections in the US and Europe, and a new wave of lockdowns across Europe.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) performed the worst, ended the day 2.54% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) ended the day 1% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) 0.52% down.\n\nYesterday after-hours, heavily-weighted tech companies, like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) reported their quarterly earnings. Though most reported third-quarter results that exceeded expectations, shares of these companies (except Alphabet) pulled back steeply today. After the strong performance of these stocks compared to the broader market this year, market participants had set their expectations exceptionally high. In other words, traders expected these companies to beat expectations by a much greater margin than they did. The earnings results for all these companies can be found in yesterday\u2019s issue of the daily recap. \n\nToday, the Federal Reserve announced it lowered the minimum loan size for its Main Street lending program to $100,000 from $250,000 and that \u201cfees have been adjusted to encourage the provision of these smaller loans\u201d. Demand for the lending program has been weak thus far, with the Fed having offered just 400 loans totaling $3.7 billion, out of the total $600 billion capacity. As many pundits have pointed out, many small- and mid-sized businesses have stayed on the sidelines from taking on more loans that they would eventually need to pay back during the pandemic.\n\nUnfortunately, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, there were 88,521 new coronavirus infections reported in the US yesterday, another record, and 9,540 more cases than were reported Wednesday. The trend this week is worrying, given that only last Friday, the US set its previous record for daily new infections. According to the Washington Post, The total number of infections reported nationwide since February is virtually guaranteed to reach 9 million on Friday, just 15 days after the tally hit 8 million. At least 228,000 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in the country.\n\nEurope is in the thralls of a second surge in coronavirus, with the continent now accounting for 46% of global cases and nearly a third of total deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO) Spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris, compared to last week, daily cases in Europe have risen by \u201cabout a third\u201d and daily deaths by \u201cclose to 40%\u201d this week. This month, both France and Spain have declared states of emergency, imposing more restrictions to try to ease up pressure on hospital ICU departments. In France, the worst-hit country, more than half of ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.\n\nToday is the last Friday before the US presidential election on Tuesday.

Market participants digested a record increase in third-quarter GDP for the US, a better-than-expected weekly unemployment report, new coronavirus restrictions in the US and Europe and a slew of corporate earnings for massive companies.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.75% today, the best performing of the major indices. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.05% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.44%.\n\nAfter coming off one of the worst quarters in US history, the economy rebounded, growing at its fastest pace ever. Gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the total goods and services produced from July to September of this year, expanded at a 33.1% annualized pace, according to the report by the Department of Commerce. The gain came after a 31.4% plunge in the second quarter and was better than the 32% estimate from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The previous record was the post-World War II 16.7% surge in the first quarter of 1950.\n\nToday, the US Department of Commerce released its weekly unemployment report, showing that another 751,000 individuals filed initial jobless claims, better than the 770,000 estimated by analysts.  Continuing claims, which refer to individuals that are currently receiving unemployment benefits who filed for unemployment benefits at least two weeks ago, was 7.75 million, slightly better than the 7.77 million expected. According to Yahoo Finance, this report represents the ninth-straight week initial unemployment claims have remained below 1 million and continuing claims below 10 million, a key indicator that the economy is recovering, though not as fast as many would like.\n\nIn Europe, countries are still struggling to contain the recent surge in coronavirus infections. Both France and Germany announced renewed lockdowns spanning for about the next month, though the restrictions stopped short of the draconian measures announced earlier on during the pandemic. In the US, the seven-day average of daily new cases rose to a record 70,000 as of yesterday, according to data compiled by the Washington Post.\n\nOn the vaccine front, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, said he believed it would take until at least January for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine. There are five companies (Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (ELY), and BioNTech (BNTX)) in the final stages of study for a coronavirus vaccine, with Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. having fully enrolled their trials, Fauci said. \n\nSome analysts consider the recent pull-back in the stock market a healthy inevitability, given the strong rally that took many stocks to all-time highs earlier in the Month.

Market participants digested a record increase in third-quarter GDP for the US, a better-than-expected weekly unemployment report, new coronavirus restrictions in the US and Europe and a slew of corporate earnings for massive companies.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.75% today, the best performing of the major indices. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.05% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.44%.\n\nAfter coming off one of the worst quarters in US history, the economy rebounded, growing at its fastest pace ever. Gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the total goods and services produced from July to September of this year, expanded at a 33.1% annualized pace, according to the report by the Department of Commerce. The gain came after a 31.4% plunge in the second quarter and was better than the 32% estimate from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The previous record was the post-World War II 16.7% surge in the first quarter of 1950.\n\nToday, the US Department of Commerce released its weekly unemployment report, showing that another 751,000 individuals filed initial jobless claims, better than the 770,000 estimated by analysts.  Continuing claims, which refer to individuals that are currently receiving unemployment benefits who filed for unemployment benefits at least two weeks ago, was 7.75 million, slightly better than the 7.77 million expected. According to Yahoo Finance, this report represents the ninth-straight week initial unemployment claims have remained below 1 million and continuing claims below 10 million, a key indicator that the economy is recovering, though not as fast as many would like.\n\nIn Europe, countries are still struggling to contain the recent surge in coronavirus infections. Both France and Germany announced renewed lockdowns spanning for about the next month, though the restrictions stopped short of the draconian measures announced earlier on during the pandemic. In the US, the seven-day average of daily new cases rose to a record 70,000 as of yesterday, according to data compiled by the Washington Post.\n\nOn the vaccine front, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, said he believed it would take until at least January for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine. There are five companies (Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (ELY), and BioNTech (BNTX)) in the final stages of study for a coronavirus vaccine, with Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. having fully enrolled their trials, Fauci said. \n\nSome analysts consider the recent pull-back in the stock market a healthy inevitability, given the strong rally that took many stocks to all-time highs earlier in the Month. Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in a note to clients, \u201cMarkets have been baking in a lot of optimism: that the pandemic was under control, that the economy was healing, and that things would be back to something approaching normal in 2021.

After adjusting for stock-based compensation and other factors, the company reported earnings of 13 cents a share, up from adjusted earnings of a penny a share a year ago. Analysts on average expected adjusted earnings of 4 cents a share on sales of $383 million.\n\nPinterest shares jumped more than 25% in after-hours trading following the report, after closing with a 7.1% decline at $48.78. Shares were topping $63 in the extended session after closing with a 6.2% decline at $49.25; Pinterest shares have never traded for higher than $53.87 in regular trading.\n\nPinterest shares have more than doubled to record highs since the social-media company\u2019s last earnings report, which predicted much higher revenue and user growth than previously expected. The online-advertising market seems to have found strength despite the pandemic, as strong third-quarter financial results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP sent stocks in ad-supported online companies higher across the board.\n\nOnline-ad stocks also experienced a jump after Pinterest\u2019s report, which arrived 24 hours ahead of quarterly reports from online-ad powerhouses Facebook Inc. FB , Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG and Twitter Inc. TWTR . Twitter shares gained more than 5% in the extended session Wednesday, while Facebook stock increased more than 2% and Google parent Alphabet added about 1%.\n\nPinterest executives said they expect revenue to grow around 60% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, roughly in line with the 58% growth in the third quarter. Pinterest reported revenue of $400 million in last year\u2019s holiday period, so the guidance suggests sales of about $640 million this year, which again trounces expectations.

After adjusting for stock-based compensation and other factors, the company reported earnings of 13 cents a share, up from adjusted earnings of a penny a share a year ago. Analysts on average expected adjusted earnings of 4 cents a share on sales of $383 million.\n\nPinterest shares jumped more than 25% in after-hours trading following the report, after closing with a 7.1% decline at $48.78. Shares were topping $63 in the extended session after closing with a 6.2% decline at $49.25; Pinterest shares have never traded for higher than $53.87 in regular trading.\n\nPinterest shares have more than doubled to record highs since the social-media company\u2019s last earnings report, which predicted much higher revenue and user growth than previously expected. The online-advertising market seems to have found strength despite the pandemic, as strong third-quarter financial results last week from Snap Inc.

Market participants are closely monitoring the rising number of coronavirus cases in the US and Europe and uncertainty surrounding stimulus and the presidential election a mere week away.\n\nIn the US, over the weekend, the US registered coronavirus cases hit a record high with more than 81,000 new cases, according to data gathered from worldometers.info. Yesterday, the US registered 70,000 new cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious disease expert said the US is still in the \u201cfirst wave\u201d of the pandemic, given that cases never stabilized to more than a \u201cmanageable level.\u201d He explained that while the Northeast has been able to reduce its outbreak, the national baseline never fell to a more manageable number like 10,000 cases per day.\n\nWith a worrying surge of cases across Europe, governments have begun imposing a new round of restrictions. Today, the Czech Republic joined France, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom in enforcing a strict nighttime curfew and placing new restrictions in businesses such as gyms and restaurants. \n\nYesterday, Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin met for what feels like the hundredth time to discuss the passage of additional stimulus. Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson Drew Hamill said of the meeting, \u201cThe Speaker remains optimistic that an agreement can be reached before the election,\u201d adding that \u201cprogress depends on Leader Mitch McConnell.\u201d Today, Senators left Washington for a break ahead of the election. With the election a mere week away and Senators no longer in Washington, chances to pass a bill are extremely thin. \n\nNext Tuesday, November 3rd are the US presidential elections between Joe Biden (D) and President Trump (R). The election is set to be extremely contentious and will have enormous effect on the market for years to come. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amazon (AMZN) plans to hire 100,000 seasonal workers heading into the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays as customers are expected to continue shopping online during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n* The chief executives of Twitter (TWTR), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet Inc (GOOG) are set for a hearing with US lawmakers on Wednesday.\n* Reopening stocks, like Airline, cruise lines and resorts, extended yesterday\u2019s losses, as traders fled from names most exposed to disruptions in the economy caused by an increase in virus cases.\n* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares sank after the company announced it agreed to purchase peer chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX) in a $35 billion all-stock deal, confirming rumors from earlier this month.

Worryingly, The seven-day average is up more than 22% compared to last week, an extremely worrying increase.

On Sunday, France reported 52,000 positive cases, a record for the country. In response, two-thirds of the country has been placed under strict, 9 p.m. curfew. In Italy, 15,199 new cases of the virus were reported, well above the previous record of 11,705. In response, the Italian government has implemented restrictions, shutting down gyms, pools and movie theaters, putting an early curfew on cafes and restaurants and mandating that people keep wearing masks outdoors. Spain, which has also been struggling with a record number of infections, declared a nationwide state of emergency and imposed a curfew. \n\nWith the November election a mere 8 days away, the chances for the passage of additional virus-relief have all but disappeared. In a letter to her fellow Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the Republicans for the failure to act in the face of the pandemic, calling their response \u201carrogance\u201d. She said, \u201cThe Republicans\u2019 continued surrender to the virus - particularly amid the recent wave cases - is official malfeasance. We must come to an agreement as soon as possible.

Though prospects for additional passage before the November election are slim, recent reports of a $1.8 trillion proposal coming from the White House and renewed talks between Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Last week\u2019s meetings between the pair did not produce an agreement, both parties are optimistic that a deal will  be worked out. In an interview with CNN, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow offered an upbeat assessment of the negotiations, saying that \u201cthe bid and offer is narrowing somewhat between the two sides.\u201d While there is a large delta between both proposals, the fact that the White House is showing a willingness to negotiate and compromise is a good sign that negotiations are going forward in good faith. \n\nThird-quarter earnings begin in earnest this week. A host of big banks, including JP Morgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C), will report earnings tomorrow. Big banks, which have underperformed the broader market since the March bottom, will provide valuable information into the extent of the ongoing strain to the US economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nFor this earnings season, analysts expect companies to report more year-on-year declines in profits due to business difficulties arising from the pandemic. According to data collected by FactSet, consensus estimates predict a earnings per share decline of 20.5% over the last year for companies in the S&amp;P 500. This earnings season comes at a very interesting time, with the market primed for several market-moving events, including the possibility of vaccine and therapeutic breakthroughs to treat coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS), \u201cNew information on the election, vaccines, and upcoming 3Q earnings represent substantial cross-currents for equities during the next two months. However, the vaccine represents a more important factor than the election result for the recovery in S&amp;P 500 fundamentals. In short, the progress of the US economy depends more on developments surrounding the disease rather than political elections or candidate differences in restoring the broken fundamentals of the stock market. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day starts today at Midnight and runs through to Wed, Oct 14.

The S&amp;P (SPY) finished 1.59% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.87%.\n\nProspects for further fiscal stimulus coming from Congress has been a main point of interest for traders since the CARES Act, the first round of stimulus passed in March, ran out on July 31. Though prospects for additional passage before the November election are slim, recent reports of a $1.8 trillion proposal coming from the White House and renewed talks between Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Last week\u2019s meetings between the pair did not produce an agreement, both parties are optimistic that a deal will  be worked out. In an interview with CNN, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow offered an upbeat assessment of the negotiations, saying that \u201cthe bid and offer is narrowing somewhat between the two sides.\u201d While there is a large delta between both proposals, the fact that the White House is showing a willingness to negotiate and compromise is a good sign that negotiations are going forward in good faith. \n\nThird-quarter earnings begin in earnest this week. A host of big banks, including JP Morgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C), will report earnings tomorrow. Big banks, which have underperformed the broader market since the March bottom, will provide valuable information into the extent of the ongoing strain to the US economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nFor this earnings season, analysts expect companies to report more year-on-year declines in profits due to business difficulties arising from the pandemic. According to data collected by FactSet, consensus estimates predict a earnings per share decline of 20.5% over the last year for companies in the S&amp;P 500. This earnings season comes at a very interesting time, with the market primed for several market-moving events, including the possibility of vaccine and therapeutic breakthroughs to treat coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS), \u201cNew information on the election, vaccines, and upcoming 3Q earnings represent substantial cross-currents for equities during the next two months. However, the vaccine represents a more important factor than the election result for the recovery in S&amp;P 500 fundamentals. In short, the progress of the US economy depends more on developments surrounding the disease rather than political elections or candidate differences in restoring the broken fundamentals of the stock market. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day starts today at Midnight and runs through to Wed, Oct 14.

The major benchmarks posted their worst September performance since 2011, according to Yahoo Finance. But zooming out to include trading from July and August, equities\u2019 third-quarter performance held up much more strongly.

Hopes for additional, much-needed stimulus dimmed after in-person talks between Pelosi, Mnuchin, and Congressional lawmakers did not produce an agreement. While the pair said they made progress and had further discussions planned, many are skeptical any kind of deal will be reached before the election in November.\n\nFor the many, the economic situation at the hands of the pandemic remains dire, with a slew of job cuts being announced.

Disney (DIS) said it would be cutting 28,000 workers across its resort business. Insurance giant Allstate (ALL) announced an 8% reduction in its workforce, impacting some 3,800 jobs. Goldman Sachs (GS) is also reportedly looking to cut about 400 jobs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, and the oil major Shell (RDS) announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs.\n\nThe labor report released this week will not capture these planned layoffs, those will most likely be reflected in next weeks\u2019 report. The Labor Department reported that another 837,000 people filed for first-time unemployment insurance. While this is below the 850,000 estimate and an improvement on last week's number, it is clear that the labor market is still struggling during the pandemic and needs Congressional assistance to get back on track.  Tomorrow September\u2019s monthly jobs report will be released. Analysts expect a fifth straight month of payroll gains and 868,000 jobs to have come back. However, after the announcement of massive job cuts this week, we\u2019ll have to see if analysts revise their estimates.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* US manufacturing activity unexpectedly decelerated in September, according to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) monthly manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI).

Furthermore, AI and other revolutionary tech will have its share at the pie. But there are clear differences in these companies and what another famous investor Buffet likes to say is that he doesn\u2019t buy companies without a moat. But what is a moat in this context?\n\n#### What\u2019s a moat in tech?\n\n&gt;The term\u00a0[economic moat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicmoat.asp), popularized by\u00a0[Warren Buffett](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/071801.asp), refers to a business\u2019 ability to maintain competitive advantages over its competitors in order to protect its long-term profits and\u00a0[market share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketshare.asp)\u00a0from competing firms. Just like a medieval castle, the moat serves to protect those inside the fortress and their riches from outsiders.  \nInvestopedia\n\nTranslated to the software world it means that the product has the users locked in due to either network effects, a unique selling point or both. An example of that is Facebook. At the start its moat was weak but now it has all the users locked in because of the network effects that it\u2019s pointless to build something else as a competitor. Another example is my favorite tech stock: **GOOG** which is a cliche but it fits all the criteria. They didn\u2019t have a network effect because they provided a service to the end customer. But their unique selling points were so strong and their tech was so ahead of the other competitors that they took over the market. So what I am really saying is that it\u2019s prudent to avoid tech stocks without a moat.\n\n#### Cloudflare (NET) as an example\n\nGiven I have a fairly good technical background in software this is a company that I admit I bought but I will sell after actually trying to use their product. What [Cloudflare](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/net) (**NET**) is selling is an edge Content Delivery Network (CDN) that quite a few companies use. But their flagship product as a CDN is widely available in other providers and for free. Their client lock in is essentially non-existent because at whatever point in time someone can just copy paste the content into another provider and her business will run uninterrupted. There is no vendor lock in, no moat.\n\nGetting more technical, check out the site that most developers use to build web applications: [React Documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment). If you go to the deployment section you can see a gazillion of competitors that offer more or less the same services. Yes Cloudflare has a stable and good business with DDOS attacks and may have a little bit better speed but their product can be very easily disrupted by the next startup that goes out of Y Combinator or any other cloud provider including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Netlify etc. In other words, this stock can go out of business and has a higher risk of ruin.\n\nP.S If you find value in what you are reading please consider subscribing to the [newsletter](https://theloft.substack.com/).", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 860957, "public", "self", "The importance of a moat in tech stocks", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j1e96v/the_importance_of_a_moat_in_tech_stocks/", "all_ads", 6, 1601303757.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "aelaos1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bziim42", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1601307357, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j1e96v/the_importance_of_a_moat_in_tech_stocks/", "gildings": {}, "id": "j1e96v", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "tickerdiscussion", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "612ee368-65e6-11e5-b53f-129e4297eb59", "link_flair_text": "Ticker Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/j1e96v/the_importance_of_a_moat_in_tech_stocks/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1601307369, "score": 1, "selftext": "Technology companies and startups can be very good plays in uncertain times.

But their flagship product as a CDN is widely available in other providers and for free. Their client lock in is essentially non-existent because at whatever point in time someone can just copy paste the content into another provider and her business will run uninterrupted. There is no vendor lock in, no moat.\n\nGetting more technical, check out the site that most developers use to build web applications: [React Documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment). If you go to the deployment section you can see a gazillion of competitors that offer more or less the same services. Yes Cloudflare has a stable and good business with DDOS attacks and may have a little bit better speed but their product can be very easily disrupted by the next startup that goes out of Y Combinator or any other cloud provider including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Netlify etc. In other words, this stock can go out of business and has a higher risk of ruin.\n\nP.S If you find value in what you are reading please consider subscribing to the [newsletter](https://theloft.substack.com/).", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 860957, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The importance of a moat in tech stocks", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j1e96v/the_importance_of_a_moat_in_tech_stocks/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1601303757.0}], [[], false, "Zathamos", null, [], null, "text", "t2_5ixqvizn", false, true, [], false, false, 1601154299, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j0duc0/why_i_blame_aapl_for_this_selloff/", {}, "j0duc0", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "discussion", [], "8acd2324-65e6-11e5-a263-122ab0778f8b", "Discussion", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 26, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/j0duc0/why_i_blame_aapl_for_this_selloff/", false, "self", {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "4OtyDGdUUzV31FlaeKOefqpupFPOUFWC_lQ4QUMpKRE", "resolutions": [{"height": 83, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/jzlNeXrx64qouyzZXTh79PtVHLRNMhSy32lKHhdwTMc.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96edd9febd297f0e833c4de19a273dc15bb4ee2e", "width": 108}, {"height": 167, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/jzlNeXrx64qouyzZXTh79PtVHLRNMhSy32lKHhdwTMc.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6f451c328c13d18a00b5a10804ea2756cd88dc1", "width": 216}, {"height": 248, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/jzlNeXrx64qouyzZXTh79PtVHLRNMhSy32lKHhdwTMc.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=027d49c9d7577327104b83eacbbc755c5bb3e793", "width": 320}, {"height": 497, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/jzlNeXrx64qouyzZXTh79PtVHLRNMhSy32lKHhdwTMc.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=581e55e5d9457d651d5df0f1c5c9c081452144a6", "width": 640}, {"height": 746, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/jzlNeXrx64qouyzZXTh79PtVHLRNMhSy32lKHhdwTMc.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=791660b79b8591be80cf36d15baa18889a00cfcb", "width": 960}, {"height": 839, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/jzlNeXrx64qouyzZXTh79PtVHLRNMhSy32lKHhdwTMc.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9c1e1522564bc321b0a57aa46e05658bc366868", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 1944, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/jzlNeXrx64qouyzZXTh79PtVHLRNMhSy32lKHhdwTMc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=c6f7169288d3b3c378c7ae80699e7f7ef3d1366a", "width": 2500}, "variants": {}}]}, 6, 1601154309, 1, "Firstly I'd just like to say in general, I am not an apple user, I in fact hate the OS but thats not why I blame them for this crash nor does it make me at all bias when dealing with the market.\n\nTo put this as simply as I can to save anyone time if you don't want to read the technicals or to get an overview, they are waaaay overvalued and make up too much of the market indexes. Simple reasoning, hype and fear. Suddenly after covid apple became 'a safe stock to keep money in' then hype built, then a split, now its just the realization of all that accumulation that has caused a sell off. \n\nBut lets get technical cuz any idiot could use that reasoning. First lets talk about Apple, their business model, and their history. Founded in 1974 by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, funded by Ronald Wayne. Wayne is inconsequential to the business so he wont come up again. Wozniak hasnt been involved since the 80s and Jobs has been gone almost a decade now. The motto behind Apple though was opposite of Microsoft's. Apple built things consumers needed and that marketed themselves. Microsoft built tech we didnt know we needed and sold that to manufacturers, not consumers. One is consumer based one is tech based, yes apple is a tech giant, but their basic business model is about consumer products, not technological advancements. I realize a lot of their products were technological advancements, but that wasnt what their business model was. If there hadnt been the market for a better smartphone we never would have gotten the iphone. There is a video online of steve jobs responding to an insult, and he basically states this during that video and its clear in what they produce and focus on. Most of these are things we see and use every day, thats the point. While yes we use Microsoft products literally every day, we aren't nearly as consciously aware of it as we are apple products. \n\nApple has also basically stopped advancing rapidly, while every year phones improve they continue to do what they did in the 80s, fall further and further behind the competition. Microsoft bailed them out in the 80s with dos coding and they got bailed out in the early 00s by Tony Fadell and phillips electronics with the ipod. Guess what, they are falling behind again. \n\nNow lets talk the stock. \nFor one, the market is based on growth, in order for a stock price to go up growth must be invisioned by investors otherwise why would anyone chase it up. Since 2015 apple has stalled though. While it's seeing great sales, the growth has stalled out, meanwhile the stock continues to go up and up, pretty counterintuitive, first warning sign.\nAAPL growth https://imgur.com/gallery/vgoQBcD\n\nBesides sales, technical chart analysis on apple should make any investor nervous. Here are 4 big market caps making up a good chunk of the nasdaq; apple, amazon, Microsoft, and google, with some trend lines im going to refer to:\nMSFT https://imgur.com/gallery/x9pCHR4\nAMZN https://imgur.com/gallery/r6uEPq4\nGOOG https://imgur.com/gallery/krlTgba\nAAPL https://imgur.com/gallery/pxtv4Uj\n\nDid you see it? All of these are over their trend lines (google not much), but its a matter of why and how much higher. \nIll start with Microsoft, 3 steady lines, 2010-2013, then 2013-2018, then 2018 to covid. Since covid Microsoft has seen growth in the use of their platforms like microsoft teams. So it makes sense they went a little higher. \nAmazon has 3 as well, 2010-2015, 2015-covid, post covid. This one frankly makes the most sense as amazon clearly got a major shot in the arm for business with covid lockdowns. So yes amazon is a lot higher, but they should be with everyone shopping from home as much as we are. Id also like to just note the richest man in the world jeff bezos makes around 215 million dollars a DAY. Amazon made over 280 billion last year, apple made 260 billion. Yet who again has the bigger market cap? Warning sign number 2 here.\nGoogle has had the most steady trend lines of all of them, they have been on their current trend since 2017 but also have 3 trend lines total, 2010 to 2014 and 2014 to 2017. They are actually currently still right on that trend line and considering how diverse owning one share makes you (space x, ai, etc), this might be one of the mist undervalued stocks on the market right now.\nNow our baby Apple, you have a trend line from basically 2010 to 2018. Since 2018 they started taking off, i guess that kinda makes sense since thats when their sales picked back up. But they had been growing for 8 years prior with no real world growth. Warning sign number 3.\nThen if we zoom in with some trend lines drawn, well take a look: Apple trend lines https://imgur.com/gallery/Uhm3xT5\nSince they announced their split jul 31st they have been moving parabolic (unsustainably vertical). Look how far off any realistic trend line it got, that is so far overextended of course its going to pull back violently. And now that their market cap (which is overvalued) is so big, when they move we all move. Microsoft is coming out with the xbox and all the gaming stocks are starting to go nuts right now, why isnt Microsoft, because of apple. If the Nasdaq looks terrible (thanks apple) the whole sector starts to bail and get into other recovery stocks like banks and travel, which is what happened. Now tech is starting to recover and the small caps are seeing big gains. But these larger caps may get stuck in place because apple realistically, still has a long way to fall. Id be willing to bet apple falls under 97 soon, followed by plummeting to 87-88, that is where the stock should actually be IMO based on chart analysis. \n\nI'm still overall bullish on the market, but damnit apple, you are not the biggest company in the world, you don't have a monopoly on phones and computers, you can't even advance your business more (they are trying with things like apple pay). Hurry up and correct yourself so we can start getting back into these great major caps like the Microsoft's, Amazon's, and Google's. \n\nSorry if this sounded like a vent, but there seems to be so many things that people are just totally willing to completly overlook with apple, cuz its apple.

Tech stocks continued pulling back, with many notable stocks breaking through well-established supports. In spite of the Fed\u2019s commitment to keep interest rates low until 2023 and mostly positive economic data, the sell off in tech, which is the largest holding in the three major benchmarks, has dragged the market down. \n\nThis week, tech stocks like Apple (AMZN), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have declined sharply after hitting consecutive record highs in August. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is the hardest hit, with prices at similar levels to early August. The S&amp;P finished the day 1.12% down, the Nasdaq 1.28% down, the Dow was 0.87% down.\n\nAfter a historic August led by tech stocks, the current volatility in the market has sharply lowered investor sentiment and belief in the prospect of a sharp recovery for the virus-ravaged economy.The still raging pandemic, combined with no fiscal stimulus from Congress, has economists lowering expectations for the remainder of the year. In a note to clients today, Goldman Sachs (GS) said, \u201cAt this point, a major stimulus package before the election looks like a long shot and we expect Congress to leave at the end of September without extending the extra unemployment insurance payment, approving another round of stimulus payments, or providing additional support to small businesses or state and local governments. Failure to pass any additional fiscal measures would likely lead us to downgrade our growth estimates for Q4\u201d\n\nEconomic data has been surprisingly good in spite of the circumstances. 860,000 people filed unemployment claims, while that\u2019s a lot normally, it has been less than 1 million for the third week straight. Continuing Claims, which are the number of people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, fell below 13 million for the first time since March highs, an encouraging sign. \n\nConfidence in the market, right now, is dependent on Congress passing more fiscal stimulus. Top FOMC officials, including Jerome Powell, and Pres. Trump have publicly endorsed the passage of more fiscal stimulus. Economists and politicians agree that more stimulus is needed to boost consumer confidence and provide much-needed support to cash-strapped families and small businesses. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* United Airlines (UAL) tells Congress 16k jobs at risk without aid. - Politico\n* Walt Disney (DIS) World Swan and Dolphin Resort to Lay Off 1,100 Employees Due to Low Occupancy \n* Grow Generation (GRWG): Roth Capital maintains BUY and raises price target to $20.

In spite of the Fed\u2019s commitment to keep interest rates low until 2023 and mostly positive economic data, the sell off in tech, which is the largest holding in the three major benchmarks, has dragged the market down. \n\nThis week, tech stocks like Apple (AMZN), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have declined sharply after hitting consecutive record highs in August. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is the hardest hit, with prices at similar levels to early August. The S&amp;P finished the day 1.12% down, the Nasdaq 1.28% down, the Dow was 0.87% down.\n\nAfter a historic August led by tech stocks, the current volatility in the market has sharply lowered investor sentiment and belief in the prospect of a sharp recovery for the virus-ravaged economy.The still raging pandemic, combined with no fiscal stimulus from Congress, has economists lowering expectations for the remainder of the year. In a note to clients today, Goldman Sachs (GS) said, \u201cAt this point, a major stimulus package before the election looks like a long shot and we expect Congress to leave at the end of September without extending the extra unemployment insurance payment, approving another round of stimulus payments, or providing additional support to small businesses or state and local governments. Failure to pass any additional fiscal measures would likely lead us to downgrade our growth estimates for Q4\u201d\n\nEconomic data has been surprisingly good in spite of the circumstances. 860,000 people filed unemployment claims, while that\u2019s a lot normally, it has been less than 1 million for the third week straight. Continuing Claims, which are the number of people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, fell below 13 million for the first time since March highs, an encouraging sign. \n\nConfidence in the market, right now, is dependent on Congress passing more fiscal stimulus. Top FOMC officials, including Jerome Powell, and Pres. Trump have publicly endorsed the passage of more fiscal stimulus. Economists and politicians agree that more stimulus is needed to boost consumer confidence and provide much-needed support to cash-strapped families and small businesses. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* United Airlines (UAL) tells Congress 16k jobs at risk without aid. - Politico\n* Walt Disney (DIS) World Swan and Dolphin Resort to Lay Off 1,100 Employees Due to Low Occupancy \n* Grow Generation (GRWG): Roth Capital maintains BUY and raises price target to $20.

My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -&gt; Aug. \n\nI beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180-&gt;300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)\n\nI did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. \n\nI did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. \n\n#High level advice:\n=========================================\n\nhttps://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/37-top-10-pieces-of-investment-advice-from-warren-buffett\n\nI picked the 7 I agree with.\n\n1. Invest in what you know\u2026and nothing more.\n2. Never compromise on business quality\n3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever\n4. Diversification can be dangerous\n5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)\n8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)\n10. Only listen to those you know and trust \n\nI firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  \n\n#General mindset:\n================\n- Keep emotions out of the market\n- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.\n- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. \n- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. \n- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)\n- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. \n\n#Application:\n==================================================================\nI was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. \n\nAs a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. \n\nBased on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good \"feel\" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). \n\nI tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. \n\nPost COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.\n\nMy hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. \n\n1. eCommerce + AdTech \n2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)\n3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)\n\nThese are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:\n\n1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?\n2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?\n3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? \n4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?\n5. Who are their customers and target demographic?\n6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.\n\nIn March, I took what I believe to be an \"educated gamble\". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.\n\nI have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.\n\nHere are the non FAANGs I chose.\n\n1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&amp;M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. \n\n2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.\n\n3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. \n\n4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.\n\n5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. \n\n6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.\n\n7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. \"Zoom parties\" and \"Zoom dates\" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.\n\n8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. \n\n10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.\n\n11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. \n\n12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. \n\n13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say \"Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?\" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.\n\n14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.\n\nMutual funds/ETFs\n1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. \n\n2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. \n\n3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... \n\nTitanvest:\nI was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.\n\n#Some things I do that that are against the grain:\n\n- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.\n\n- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.\n\n- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. \n\nOne example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. \n\nLastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. \n\nAlso, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence.

My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -&gt; Aug. \n\nI beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180-&gt;300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)\n\nI did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. \n\nI did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. \n\n#High level advice:\n=========================================\n\nhttps://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/37-top-10-pieces-of-investment-advice-from-warren-buffett\n\nI picked the 7 I agree with.\n\n1. Invest in what you know\u2026and nothing more.\n2. Never compromise on business quality\n3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever\n4. Diversification can be dangerous\n5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)\n8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)\n10. Only listen to those you know and trust \n\nI firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  \n\n#General mindset:\n================\n- Keep emotions out of the market\n- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.\n- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. \n- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. \n- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)\n- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. \n\n#Application:\n==================================================================\nI was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. \n\nAs a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. \n\nBased on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good \"feel\" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). \n\nI tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. \n\nPost COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.\n\nMy hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. \n\n1. eCommerce + AdTech \n2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)\n3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)\n\nThese are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:\n\n1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?\n2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?\n3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? \n4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?\n5. Who are their customers and target demographic?\n6.

When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech.

After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. \n\n2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.\n\n3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name.

with Google apps and services built-in.\n\n[https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/android-for-cars.html](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/android-for-cars.html) \n\nI'm a developer and I follow Android auto development somewhat closely, and this has led me to believe that Google / Alphabet is going to be getting into fleet management with Android Automotive OS. This is going to continue to grow with consumers, but also commercial vehicle fleets in a huge way. This is so much more than a modern radio ui for cars.\n\nPaying for EV charging, monetized in-car apps, paying for tolls, driver monitoring, fleet route management and logistics, fleet fuel payments, rental car management, corporate car management, last-mile delivery management - Google is going to own this space in a few years. Android Auto was a huge exercise in in-car UI. This is a next step towards Alphabet running the infrastructure of fleet logistics, skimming a little bit off every transaction that runs through cars. Monetizing the prominence of certain EV charging stations over others during route calculations.

This is going to continue to grow with consumers, but also commercial vehicle fleets in a huge way. This is so much more than a modern radio ui for cars.\n\nPaying for EV charging, monetized in-car apps, paying for tolls, driver monitoring, fleet route management and logistics, fleet fuel payments, rental car management, corporate car management, last-mile delivery management - Google is going to own this space in a few years. Android Auto was a huge exercise in in-car UI. This is a next step towards Alphabet running the infrastructure of fleet logistics, skimming a little bit off every transaction that runs through cars. Monetizing the prominence of certain EV charging stations over others during route calculations. Making fuel / charging payment as seamless as a Tesla connecting to a supercharger for everyone else. \n\nThis complete vehicle systems integration with the OS is a step away from integration with Waymo autonomous technology in the future.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/here-comes-one-of-the-newsiest-and-most-critical-weeks-of-the-summer-for-markets.html)**\n*****\n&gt; In a summer of unending news, we may be heading into what could be the newsiest week of all.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq\u2019s sputtering rally could be put to its biggest test yet, as tech bellwether Apple and other stalwarts of the tech rally report earnings. Early in the week, Republicans will unveil their stimulus package proposal, which will then be debated as Friday\u2019s deadline nears for the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve also meets on and is likely to discuss other steps it can take. It\u2019s not likely, however, to make any moves as it wraps up on Wednesday, other than to assure markets it will continue to use extraordinary programs to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Then on Thursday, the government will release a big number many investors have been dreading \u2014 the first official reading of second quarter gross domestic product, which which should show how hard the economy crashed when it was abruptly shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a contraction of about 35% in the second quarter, followed by a bounce back in the third quarter. But the size of that comeback could be directly impacted by how much stimulus Congress gives the economy, and how much the coronavirus continues to impact businesses and economic activity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s a clear understanding of how much the economy has leaned on the crutch of government stimulus, both fiscally and monetarily,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cEveryone will be watching for what will replace the $600 a week, and that will be the most important component of whatever plan they come up with.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The $600 weekly payment to about 30 million unemployed Americans expires Friday, and it is unlikely Congress will have a plan before that date. Strategists expect the amount to be cut in half, and Boockvar said the amount of that payment will directly impact the size of the boost to the economy\n*****\n&gt; The stimulus and tech earnings could both be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat the package looks like will be a huge deal, particularly on the unemployment benefits side, and whether tech companies can exceed the bar,\u201d said Boockvar. \u201cThat\u2019s very hard for them right now. So if they miss, does that mean it\u2019s going to be a negative for tech and not the whole market? Are we going to keep rotating to value from growth because tech has been so dominant it could take everything down?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to decline by 40.3% for the second quarter, based on the results of companies that have already reported and estimates, according to Refinifiv\u2019s I/B/E/S. Technology earnings are expected to have one of the smallest profit declines, at just 4.4% on average.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, which had rallied to record highs this summer, ended lower for a second week, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings numbers overall, they\u2019ve been pretty good. It\u2019s just the basic problem with the stock market right now is that valuations are still pretty high,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cOther parts of the market that maybe look cheap on a price-to-book basis, their earnings have been hit. In the case of certain retailers, airlines, you have to worry about when their business is going to come back, if ever.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 80% of the companies already reporting have beaten Wall Street estimates. That is well above the average beat rate of about 65%, since 1994.\n*****\n&gt; Dozens of major companies report in the coming week, including Facebook on Wednesday and Alphabet and Amazon on Thursday. Pharmaceuticals Merck, Pfizer and Eli Lilly are expected to report, and consumer products names Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and Procter &amp; Gamble also release results. Big oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron report Friday.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus from Congress and the Fed\n&gt; Strategists expect Congress to ultimately adopt a new stimulus package of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, but after the GOP plan is introduced it will have to be squared with Democrats\u2019 proposals. The House has its own $3 trillion spending plan. It is unlikely an agreement can be approved before unemployment benefits expire Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBipartisan negotiations between the White House, House, and Senate are officially underway, but we expect brinkmanship before passage. Trump administration officials also diverge on their expectations on timing, which remains optimistically by the end of July, and possibly stretching into August under the more \u2018realistic\u2019 case,\u201d writes Ed Mills, policy strategist at Raymond James.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills expects the $600 weekly payment to be cut to $300 or $400, and he said it\u2019s possible there would be more funds given to a Payroll Protection Program, to help small businesses.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOverall, momentum is building for the next package and the final price tag is arguably moving up (closer to $1.5 -2 trillion),\u201d Mills noted. Congress has already allocated $2.4 trillion in prior spending.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed will be discussing its own stimulus, and some economists expect it could again be talking about new tactics to keep interest rates low. One idea is a policy of forward guidance, where the Fed would steer market expectations more explicitly. Another is the Fed would use targeted Treasury purchases to control specific interest rates. But no new programs are expected to be announced.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey pretty much told us, they\u2019re all in. They told us they\u2019re willing to do whatever else it takes,\u201d said Keon. \u201cThe Fed is not going to be our problem. The Fed just told us they\u2019re going to do anything they can do to soften the blow from the virus.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/rshk3gVX/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/y6nsD6FQ/marketdata3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/nrVx3NtG/finvizfuts1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/NLhf0Rdn/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/gJmb01rb/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/vBhFxX6g/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Jn6YWFkq/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/85PX9Gjc/maketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/fRgk0Fb6/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C57tdKXj/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/HknGcQpj/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FsD5HPX2/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/Nfgvt3S6/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week\n\n&gt; The earnings slate continues to ramp up next week with 712 total companies scheduled to report. In the table below, we show the largest stocks by market cap that are set to report quarterly results. On Monday, there will be no company with a market cap above $100 billion reporting with the largest companies being Alexandria Real Estate (ARE) and multiple banks. On Tuesday, payment processor Visa (V) will be out with earnings in addition to Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN), McDonald's (MCD), and Raytheon (RTX). Visa has historically averaged the strongest stock price reaction to earnings of these names but it has gapped down for six straight quarters. That will be followed by another payment processor, Paypal (PYPL) on Wednesday. In addition to Paypal, Facebook (FB) is also scheduled to report that same day. While both stocks have averaged over 2% gains on earnings days historically, ServiceNow (NOW) has seen an even stronger performance with an average gain of 3.64%. Another major earnings report that will be widely watched is Boeing (BA) to get a gauge on how demolished travel demand has affected the company. On Thursday, three of the world's largest stocks will also be out with earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG). Each one has averaged a 1%+ gain on earnings days. Apple (AAPL) has seen some of the strongest results in recent history with last quarter snapping a streak of four consecutive triple plays. On Friday, two of the largest energy stocks, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), will round out the week and July's earning calendar. Both stocks have historically averaged declines on earnings days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/Earn3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dollar Weakness May Continue\n\n&gt; The US dollar was remarkably strong during the first quarter of 2020, benefitting from the flight to safety and rallying to nearly a 10% year-to-date gain at the stock market\u2019s low point on March 23. However, as equity markets have recovered, and the US has continued to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the dollar has given up nearly all of those gains. We think this trend may continue, and if so, it would have important implications for a range of asset classes.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a more diversified basket than the commonly cited DXY Index, is nearing a critical uptrend line. A break of this support could mean that weakness seen over the past few months is more than just an unwinding of the flight to safety. Through Wednesday, the index was down more than 1% for the week and tracking toward its fourth straight weekly loss.\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t just a technical story though. As we explored last month, rising twin deficits have historically been followed by a weaker dollar, meaning the fundamentals support this move as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/July-23-picture.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The commodity rally is another reason to believe the market may be looking toward a weaker dollar. Commodities are typically viewed as having an inverse relationship with the dollar since the dollar is effectively the denominator of a hard asset. Gold prices are up more than 20% year to date, copper just traded to its highest level in more than two years, and silver prices have appreciated 28% this month alone.\n\n&gt; As for the implications of a weaker dollar, according to LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201ca weaker US dollar may be a slight negative for US consumers\u2019 buying power, but for investors\u2019 portfolios the implications are overwhelmingly positive. Commodities are rallying, US multinational companies benefit from foreign buyers being able to afford more of their goods, and international stocks do well as their underlying currencies appreciate.\u201d\n\n&gt; Recent history bears this out. The last calendar year that saw a significant dollar decline was 2017 when the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell more than 8%. The S&amp;P 500 Index rallied more than 19% on a price return basis; however, international stocks fared even better. The MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 22% and 34%, respectively, and 2017 represented the only year since 2012 that either outperformed the US.\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Gets the Gold for YTD Performance\n\n&gt; In last night's Closer, we took a look at the massive rallies of late in the precious metals space. Gold (GLD) reached its highest level since 2011, but silver's (SLV) performance on the day was even more of a sight to behold with gains in the top 1% of all days since SLV began trading in 2006. Silver (SLV) rose 6.15% for its best day since March 24th when the metal rose 7.96%. Whereas the silver to gold ratio has been in a constant downtrend over the past decade (indicating underperformance of silver relative to gold), yesterday's big gains led to a breakout of this downtrend. With SLV trading higher by over 5% yet again this morning, that downtrend is being broken even more significantly, and that is even with SLV off the pre-market highs above $21.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; As recently as the final days of June, SLV was actually sitting on a loss year to date. That was a far cry from the performance of some of the best-performing assets of the year at the time like the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) which was up over 14% and the long term Treasuries ETF (TLT) which was up over 21.5%. Silver's yellow cousin, gold, was likewise sitting on a sizeable gain of 16.6%. Pivot ahead to today and the picture is very different. Around this morning's premarket highs when SLV was trading above $21, it actually topped QQQ, TLT, and GLD as the best performing asset in 2020. That is even with each of these other ETFs also trading higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys\n\n&gt; Despite persistent pandemic setbacks, bleak economic and corporate numbers, geopolitical tensions, civic unrest and a knock-down, drag-out election battle, the U.S. stock market has proven rather resilient. After suffering the shortest bear market in history that lasted only 40 days the velocity and strength of the V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low has been impressive.\n\n&gt; Massive fiscal stimulus, the return of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), vaccine promise and the boon of the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d economy have sent the market higher again here in July with NASDAQ tacking on new all-time highs, though the Dow and S&amp;P 500 continue to struggle. As of yesterday\u2019s close this put DJIA up 4.6%, S&amp;P 500 up 5.7% and NASDAQ up 6.4% for the month of July at yesterday\u2019s close, qualifying this as a \u201cHot July Market\u201d.\n\n&gt; Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by a late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of -7.2% on average (-4.7% median decline) in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year. The low in 2018 came a bit late, but it was just 2 days into winter. There were also prior lower prices in late October and November.\n\n&gt; Climbing COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths have forced rollbacks and pauses of economic reopening plans and travel restrictions. Coupled with an uptick in jobless claims and other troublesome economic readings and forecasts as well as elevated valuations, exuberant sentiment, technical resistance and seasonal weakness, stocks are ripe for a pullback. Today\u2019s selloff: case in point. This will likely set up a great buy as the $13+ trillion flows through the global economy into US stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8b02cd9a08b7fedd5996d544420d9cd8/cb70e70b199ba14d-04/s500x750/c8010183a653633c81747813512c8c74ed5214a2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$PYPL** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$APHA** \n&gt; * **$EBAY** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$RTX** \n&gt; * **$AZN** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$CNC** \n&gt; * **$MO** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$GOOG** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$GILD**\n&gt; * **$NOW** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$DXCM** \n&gt; * **$ABCB** \n&gt; * **$BUD** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$PINS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$WING** \n&gt; * **$LRCX**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/fRgk0Fb6/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/kg5BG97Q/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR MONDAY, JULY 27TH, 2020!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR2gdg5q/eram01.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8D2LRQ6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/C6Upp8Y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/O5wY9g7.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MjSLIaQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EictqLG.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XGrwuKt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HMjc0WJ.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/0hMH94x.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vFJ1WH4.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7otjSsD.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/7g6UICu.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FKHIibS.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/l21kL5q.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rrBxXn7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/X4senHx.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KqxX8LC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/3l48OVf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.31.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0VTb4f4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.31.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.

Option traders are pricing in a 5.0% move on earnings and the stock has averaged a 4.7% move in recent quarters.\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=MMM&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 762404, "public", "self", "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning July 27th, 2020", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hxn22g/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "all_ads", 6, 1595681517.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bigbear0083", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_eaak0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595685117, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hxn22g/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hxn22g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/hxn22g/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "3iUE-7nduS9h30boAK3DoMwi3lAKDE0kK6Q2Ki52-Hw", "resolutions": [{"height": 66, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/k1eEsFvA2ja9TSpQLv19DIipavLxxYBbULmE6ipSNFU.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58fafbc56f93d65589f946ed66b3bf8e39e992cf", "width": 108}, {"height": 133, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/k1eEsFvA2ja9TSpQLv19DIipavLxxYBbULmE6ipSNFU.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a426bd7c2670c13b4bd4599331d2d16a3be8e8e1", "width": 216}, {"height": 197, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/k1eEsFvA2ja9TSpQLv19DIipavLxxYBbULmE6ipSNFU.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68f539faf49e61a18dc917df0dce2930e3cfa09a", "width": 320}, {"height": 394, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/k1eEsFvA2ja9TSpQLv19DIipavLxxYBbULmE6ipSNFU.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b172d2da63aa7ff44f81ccb4d7c76a1530da4d85", "width": 640}, {"height": 591, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/k1eEsFvA2ja9TSpQLv19DIipavLxxYBbULmE6ipSNFU.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6af33b055b58ce4bd808839ab5ce86bc02c0b1d", "width": 960}, {"height": 665, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/k1eEsFvA2ja9TSpQLv19DIipavLxxYBbULmE6ipSNFU.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3722cc54e5d510e60919ff0eb8a09e7a177c68ef", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 759, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/k1eEsFvA2ja9TSpQLv19DIipavLxxYBbULmE6ipSNFU.png?auto=webp&amp;s=fe66248de0cd47c409f4655ff0159b288c0473a3", "width": 1231}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1595685131, "score": 1, "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/here-comes-one-of-the-newsiest-and-most-critical-weeks-of-the-summer-for-markets.html)**\n*****\n&gt; In a summer of unending news, we may be heading into what could be the newsiest week of all.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq\u2019s sputtering rally could be put to its biggest test yet, as tech bellwether Apple and other stalwarts of the tech rally report earnings. Early in the week, Republicans will unveil their stimulus package proposal, which will then be debated as Friday\u2019s deadline nears for the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve also meets on and is likely to discuss other steps it can take. It\u2019s not likely, however, to make any moves as it wraps up on Wednesday, other than to assure markets it will continue to use extraordinary programs to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Then on Thursday, the government will release a big number many investors have been dreading \u2014 the first official reading of second quarter gross domestic product, which which should show how hard the economy crashed when it was abruptly shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a contraction of about 35% in the second quarter, followed by a bounce back in the third quarter. But the size of that comeback could be directly impacted by how much stimulus Congress gives the economy, and how much the coronavirus continues to impact businesses and economic activity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s a clear understanding of how much the economy has leaned on the crutch of government stimulus, both fiscally and monetarily,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cEveryone will be watching for what will replace the $600 a week, and that will be the most important component of whatever plan they come up with.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The $600 weekly payment to about 30 million unemployed Americans expires Friday, and it is unlikely Congress will have a plan before that date. Strategists expect the amount to be cut in half, and Boockvar said the amount of that payment will directly impact the size of the boost to the economy\n*****\n&gt; The stimulus and tech earnings could both be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat the package looks like will be a huge deal, particularly on the unemployment benefits side, and whether tech companies can exceed the bar,\u201d said Boockvar. \u201cThat\u2019s very hard for them right now. So if they miss, does that mean it\u2019s going to be a negative for tech and not the whole market? Are we going to keep rotating to value from growth because tech has been so dominant it could take everything down?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to decline by 40.3% for the second quarter, based on the results of companies that have already reported and estimates, according to Refinifiv\u2019s I/B/E/S. Technology earnings are expected to have one of the smallest profit declines, at just 4.4% on average.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, which had rallied to record highs this summer, ended lower for a second week, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings numbers overall, they\u2019ve been pretty good. It\u2019s just the basic problem with the stock market right now is that valuations are still pretty high,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cOther parts of the market that maybe look cheap on a price-to-book basis, their earnings have been hit. In the case of certain retailers, airlines, you have to worry about when their business is going to come back, if ever.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 80% of the companies already reporting have beaten Wall Street estimates. That is well above the average beat rate of about 65%, since 1994.\n*****\n&gt; Dozens of major companies report in the coming week, including Facebook on Wednesday and Alphabet and Amazon on Thursday. Pharmaceuticals Merck, Pfizer and Eli Lilly are expected to report, and consumer products names Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and Procter &amp; Gamble also release results. Big oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron report Friday.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus from Congress and the Fed\n&gt; Strategists expect Congress to ultimately adopt a new stimulus package of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, but after the GOP plan is introduced it will have to be squared with Democrats\u2019 proposals. The House has its own $3 trillion spending plan. It is unlikely an agreement can be approved before unemployment benefits expire Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBipartisan negotiations between the White House, House, and Senate are officially underway, but we expect brinkmanship before passage. Trump administration officials also diverge on their expectations on timing, which remains optimistically by the end of July, and possibly stretching into August under the more \u2018realistic\u2019 case,\u201d writes Ed Mills, policy strategist at Raymond James.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills expects the $600 weekly payment to be cut to $300 or $400, and he said it\u2019s possible there would be more funds given to a Payroll Protection Program, to help small businesses.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOverall, momentum is building for the next package and the final price tag is arguably moving up (closer to $1.5 -2 trillion),\u201d Mills noted. Congress has already allocated $2.4 trillion in prior spending.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed will be discussing its own stimulus, and some economists expect it could again be talking about new tactics to keep interest rates low. One idea is a policy of forward guidance, where the Fed would steer market expectations more explicitly. Another is the Fed would use targeted Treasury purchases to control specific interest rates. But no new programs are expected to be announced.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey pretty much told us, they\u2019re all in. They told us they\u2019re willing to do whatever else it takes,\u201d said Keon. \u201cThe Fed is not going to be our problem. The Fed just told us they\u2019re going to do anything they can do to soften the blow from the virus.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/rshk3gVX/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/y6nsD6FQ/marketdata3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/nrVx3NtG/finvizfuts1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/NLhf0Rdn/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/gJmb01rb/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/vBhFxX6g/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Jn6YWFkq/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/85PX9Gjc/maketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/fRgk0Fb6/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C57tdKXj/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/HknGcQpj/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FsD5HPX2/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/Nfgvt3S6/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week\n\n&gt; The earnings slate continues to ramp up next week with 712 total companies scheduled to report. In the table below, we show the largest stocks by market cap that are set to report quarterly results. On Monday, there will be no company with a market cap above $100 billion reporting with the largest companies being Alexandria Real Estate (ARE) and multiple banks. On Tuesday, payment processor Visa (V) will be out with earnings in addition to Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN), McDonald's (MCD), and Raytheon (RTX). Visa has historically averaged the strongest stock price reaction to earnings of these names but it has gapped down for six straight quarters. That will be followed by another payment processor, Paypal (PYPL) on Wednesday. In addition to Paypal, Facebook (FB) is also scheduled to report that same day. While both stocks have averaged over 2% gains on earnings days historically, ServiceNow (NOW) has seen an even stronger performance with an average gain of 3.64%. Another major earnings report that will be widely watched is Boeing (BA) to get a gauge on how demolished travel demand has affected the company. On Thursday, three of the world's largest stocks will also be out with earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG). Each one has averaged a 1%+ gain on earnings days. Apple (AAPL) has seen some of the strongest results in recent history with last quarter snapping a streak of four consecutive triple plays. On Friday, two of the largest energy stocks, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), will round out the week and July's earning calendar. Both stocks have historically averaged declines on earnings days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/Earn3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dollar Weakness May Continue\n\n&gt; The US dollar was remarkably strong during the first quarter of 2020, benefitting from the flight to safety and rallying to nearly a 10% year-to-date gain at the stock market\u2019s low point on March 23. However, as equity markets have recovered, and the US has continued to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the dollar has given up nearly all of those gains. We think this trend may continue, and if so, it would have important implications for a range of asset classes.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a more diversified basket than the commonly cited DXY Index, is nearing a critical uptrend line. A break of this support could mean that weakness seen over the past few months is more than just an unwinding of the flight to safety. Through Wednesday, the index was down more than 1% for the week and tracking toward its fourth straight weekly loss.\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t just a technical story though. As we explored last month, rising twin deficits have historically been followed by a weaker dollar, meaning the fundamentals support this move as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/July-23-picture.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The commodity rally is another reason to believe the market may be looking toward a weaker dollar. Commodities are typically viewed as having an inverse relationship with the dollar since the dollar is effectively the denominator of a hard asset. Gold prices are up more than 20% year to date, copper just traded to its highest level in more than two years, and silver prices have appreciated 28% this month alone.\n\n&gt; As for the implications of a weaker dollar, according to LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201ca weaker US dollar may be a slight negative for US consumers\u2019 buying power, but for investors\u2019 portfolios the implications are overwhelmingly positive. Commodities are rallying, US multinational companies benefit from foreign buyers being able to afford more of their goods, and international stocks do well as their underlying currencies appreciate.\u201d\n\n&gt; Recent history bears this out. The last calendar year that saw a significant dollar decline was 2017 when the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell more than 8%. The S&amp;P 500 Index rallied more than 19% on a price return basis; however, international stocks fared even better. The MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 22% and 34%, respectively, and 2017 represented the only year since 2012 that either outperformed the US.\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Gets the Gold for YTD Performance\n\n&gt; In last night's Closer, we took a look at the massive rallies of late in the precious metals space. Gold (GLD) reached its highest level since 2011, but silver's (SLV) performance on the day was even more of a sight to behold with gains in the top 1% of all days since SLV began trading in 2006. Silver (SLV) rose 6.15% for its best day since March 24th when the metal rose 7.96%. Whereas the silver to gold ratio has been in a constant downtrend over the past decade (indicating underperformance of silver relative to gold), yesterday's big gains led to a breakout of this downtrend. With SLV trading higher by over 5% yet again this morning, that downtrend is being broken even more significantly, and that is even with SLV off the pre-market highs above $21.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; As recently as the final days of June, SLV was actually sitting on a loss year to date. That was a far cry from the performance of some of the best-performing assets of the year at the time like the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) which was up over 14% and the long term Treasuries ETF (TLT) which was up over 21.5%. Silver's yellow cousin, gold, was likewise sitting on a sizeable gain of 16.6%. Pivot ahead to today and the picture is very different. Around this morning's premarket highs when SLV was trading above $21, it actually topped QQQ, TLT, and GLD as the best performing asset in 2020. That is even with each of these other ETFs also trading higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys\n\n&gt; Despite persistent pandemic setbacks, bleak economic and corporate numbers, geopolitical tensions, civic unrest and a knock-down, drag-out election battle, the U.S. stock market has proven rather resilient. After suffering the shortest bear market in history that lasted only 40 days the velocity and strength of the V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low has been impressive.\n\n&gt; Massive fiscal stimulus, the return of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), vaccine promise and the boon of the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d economy have sent the market higher again here in July with NASDAQ tacking on new all-time highs, though the Dow and S&amp;P 500 continue to struggle. As of yesterday\u2019s close this put DJIA up 4.6%, S&amp;P 500 up 5.7% and NASDAQ up 6.4% for the month of July at yesterday\u2019s close, qualifying this as a \u201cHot July Market\u201d.\n\n&gt; Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by a late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of -7.2% on average (-4.7% median decline) in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year. The low in 2018 came a bit late, but it was just 2 days into winter. There were also prior lower prices in late October and November.\n\n&gt; Climbing COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths have forced rollbacks and pauses of economic reopening plans and travel restrictions. Coupled with an uptick in jobless claims and other troublesome economic readings and forecasts as well as elevated valuations, exuberant sentiment, technical resistance and seasonal weakness, stocks are ripe for a pullback.

I have read about the importance of diversification and DCA'ing, and over the last few months have been contributing a healthy amount to whats grown into a 38 stock portfolio. I really have no desire to keep tabs on all of these and would much rather contribute to a low expense index fund(s). But I guess I'm afraid of having future FOMO by selling my current positions and potentially lose out on any massive gains an index fund might not yield me. For one reason or another I see most of my positions as relatively \"safe\" and not a bunch of penny meme stocks. \n\nI don't really know what to do and I'm looking for some advice. Should I stop contributing to this portfolio and \"let it ride\", and put all future monies into a new portfolio with only index funds? Do I sell-off everything for a modest profit and reinvest everything into indexes? Or, should I continue to add to this little by little while also opening a separate portfolio for indexes? \n\nI'm not looking to touch this money for a few years (lets say 5-10).

I have read about the importance of diversification and DCA'ing, and over the last few months have been contributing a healthy amount to whats grown into a 38 stock portfolio. I really have no desire to keep tabs on all of these and would much rather contribute to a low expense index fund(s). But I guess I'm afraid of having future FOMO by selling my current positions and potentially lose out on any massive gains an index fund might not yield me. For one reason or another I see most of my positions as relatively \"safe\" and not a bunch of penny meme stocks. \n\nI don't really know what to do and I'm looking for some advice. Should I stop contributing to this portfolio and \"let it ride\", and put all future monies into a new portfolio with only index funds? Do I sell-off everything for a modest profit and reinvest everything into indexes? Or, should I continue to add to this little by little while also opening a separate portfolio for indexes? \n\nI'm not looking to touch this money for a few years (lets say 5-10). I have separate accounts for retirement. \n\nThanks for any insight you can give me! \n\n\nPositions:\n38\nCost basis:\n$18,995.63\nValue:\n$20,522.81\nUnrealized gain:\n+$1,527.18

I don't post much so please excuse the poor formatting and multi-topic post. I plan to post this across a few subreddits. \n\n# I am writing to you guys today because I don't have anyone to give me sound advice. I would like you to review my current position and future trajectory in life. Help me set myself up for financial independence, freedom and hopefully an upper echelon in society. This isn't your traditional financial post. I could probably use  advice in more than one aspect of my life. \n\nTLDR; Weak family beginnings. Abusive absent father, decaying mother. Ambitious son (me) overcame a childhood of loneliness and hardship. I am more mature, responsible and ambitious than everyone else I know at my age group. I feel like I deserve more than I currently have and I need to continue pushing myself to get there to the point I am becoming greedy and frugal.  Skip **Backstory** and go straight to **current living conditions/spending** if you don't care for the long read.\n\n***Backstory:*** \n\nOur Family is weak and unorganized. My dead grandmother died of cancer at 65. She had my mother, aunt and uncle from age 14-16 with my Greek grandfather who was 21 or 22 at the time and left back to Greece. leaving her in Ontario with 3 children. With no education and being a teen mom did not set the next generation up well for the future.\n\nWhen my mother was young she was very smart and did well in elementary and high school,I'm lucky to have a kind mother. My grandmother kicked out  her 3 kids at 18 so she could enjoy the rest of her youth. \n\nThey lived together and all worked 2 jobs to survive. My aunt was a stripper and my mom was a waitress at the same club. I'm not too sure about my uncle. My mom was groped by a drunk patron and the manager did nothing so she quit.\n\nEventually ending up at a good job involving computers in the floppy disc ages at a large company. IT or data entry maybe?  I don't know anything between that time gap, but it's several years. \n\nMy mom met my dad at some company baseball game.  \n\nLittle did she know what a piece of shit he was. He knocked her up and came and went as he pleased, mooching off her for her car, food, condo all which she achieved on her own. I'm assuming my mom was desperate for affection and stability not being close to our grandma and having no dad.\n\nFew years later my sister was born. My dad convinced my mother he wanted to settle down and get married (they didn't). Told her to sell her condo and he would sell his parents house that 6 of his family were living in\u2026 idk how she believed that. As soon as her condo sold he said he wasn't able to sell his house.\n\nWhile my mom was pregnant with my sister she was getting severe stomach pain and colon pain. The doctors brushed it off as pregnancy related pain and said it was normal.\n\nTruth was she had terrible terrible colon cancer and it was bad. My mom doesn't like to talk about her health but she is scarred everywhere from c-sections and surgeries. They caught the cancer late after she gave birth to my sister. My mom had several intense surgeries, not going very smoothly. She has plastic tubing for a colon and osteomy bag, poor circulation.\n\nMy father emptied her bank accounts and stole her car while watching us. Let my RESP payments laps and I ended up losing mine.  (maybe the money is still out there somewhere, my mom says it's gone). When she got out of the hospital she was like 90 pounds and in a wheelchair. Still battling cancer in her late 20\u2019s. My Dad got fed up of looking after us solely and said \u201cthings like its been 2 months since you gave birth when the fuck are you getting out of that chair and going to watch the children?\u201d All this time my mom is on her own. Poor relationships with her mother, sister and brother and she is the smart and responsible one out of the bunch.\n\nShe has benefits at work and is on disability, bought a new house and is raising us alone.Its a good thing she was able to get a mortgage and LOC and credit cards before going on disability, playing off her sickness.\n\nIn and out of court with my dad fighting for child support and sole custody, there is a court order he can pick us up and drop us off every second weekend. They probably hired lawyers and went to court on several occasions. My father has a job with Canada Post, a decent job.\n\nYears go by, my mom is slowly recovering from eating healthy and doing light exercise. My dad convinces her he wants to be in his young kids lives and he made so many mistakes with us and her and that he loves her. She sells her house and buys a bigger house ( the current house we have lived in for 18 years) It doesn't work out, he hasn't changed, she finally learns and realizes and he is gone for good. Several court battles later claiming she is alienating and abusing us from the father. Throwing money at my mom with crooked family lawyers stirring the pot on both sides (several of her own lawyers fucked her). Our whole childhood was robbed with a stressed out overworked sick mother, abusive father towards me and my sister, emotional physical and slight sexual towards my sister.\n\nYears of scraping along and bad lawyers dragging things out ruined my mom. So much stress and no support. She doesn't sleep well and doesn't eat well, it's broken her. I've tried to ask about her health and her finances but she is a private introvert and says it's none of my business. She has been suffering from depression for many years, she tells me she has MS. She is tired all the time, she can't control her emotions. She has a hearing and sight issue. She has poor communication skills and emotional intelligence. I think me and her might be somewhere on the spectrum. At a first glance you wouldn't be able to tell these things about her. Besides her talking very loud all the time not realizing how much louder she is talking than those speaking to her. I could be wrong about myself as well and it may just be that I was poorly socialized as a kid.\n\nI started working at a grocery store at 12 or 13 years old and I have had 1 or 2 jobs at a time since. My mom couldn't afford to give me an allowance, if i needed money i had to work for it.. My mom needed to give the manager of a grocery store a signed letter saying it was legal for him to be hiring me. Growing up I knew not to ask for things from the store, or say what things I liked or wished I had. I remember teaching my little sister the same, constantly telling her we didn't have money for that or it was a waste of money.\n\nI feel emotionless from all the weed I smoked growing up. I was high on marijuana more than I was sober from 14-21 minus the year and a half break I took while aggressively losing weight and doing lots of cardio and weights. 13-17 I got really fat sitting and playing video games eating unhealthy and smoking. I don't get angry, I don't get scared. I am confident in the fact that I don't care what many people think and I don't have time for their laziness or bullshit. My former introverted shy self is gone, but any happiness I feel is short lived and quickly fleeting. I've been depressed for so long  it just feels normal. What keeps me going is my will to finally live financially free and explore what life has to offer, I hope I still have passion when that is all said and done. I want to make a woman happy and to feel wanted and lusted over. I want to pass on a hard work ethic, reason, wisdom, problem solving skills and a financial fortune to a child.\n\nI am not that close with my sister or my mom. Our crucial years of growing together were all ruined. And now I feel like my mom has been poisoned into being toxic by being mistreated and her decaying health.\n\nShe started taking out her misery on me when I was an older teenager. The court battles were not over. Skipping school and becoming careless I just wanted to get away from it all, my slipping grades and poor attendance were ammunition for my dad against her. Him paying child support was conditional that i was a student and a dependent, he owed her thousands towards my sisters schooling costs and retroactive child support. My sister and myself are extremely intelligent. I am more of a hands-on learner. My sister is quite the academic. She is multilingual and  was enrolled in a french immersion private school from grades 6-8. Doing accelerated classes. Paid for by a family friend of my moms from her old company. He is somewhat like a grandfather towards us. She has also completed 2 or 3 university and college programs. Her latest program was supposed to be linked with an employment or intern position in communications and human resources but COVID-19 fucked that all up.\n\nI hung out with anyone who would put up with me\u2026 I didn't know how to socialize, I ate food that made me feel good, I smoked weed constantly and I played video games. Video Games saved me from the bad influences I was hanging out with (kids doing hard drugs, selling drugs, getting into fights). Video games was the one thing I was good at, that I could show the world I had skill in something. I played competitive games, that's all I cared about.   I was gaining a lot of weight in my teenage years, which still affects my physique today. I can gain fat back extremely quickly even though I managed to get into good shape and quit smoking weed for a  year and a half. No father and living with 2 women while being an introvert and a loner, did not help me with women. I was happy to lose my virginity at 18 after getting hard into the gym and getting into shape to some yolo party chick. RIP so many missed sexual advances growing up. Thankfully I had blonde hair and green eyes and nice features before I started gaining weight and eventually losing my hair. Probably a mix between starving myself to  lose weight fast and poor nutrition, high stress and wearing a lot of hats growing up. Falling in and out of the gym after 20 and being in relationships with some poorly selected ladies I started smoking a lot of weed again, putting back on the weight and getting weak. \n\nFound someone willing to pay me for Working construction. And I got a side job as a server. I was able to save up 40k cash. I ended up giving it to my mom for rent for the next few years. Construction was 6AM-6PM 7 days a week cash. And i would work a few hours after that at a restaurant.  This was not sustainable. I ended up getting really stressed out and went back into living in my room playing video games with my rent taken care of. (i really wish i had invested that money and found a new job) \n\nThis is getting too long, and I apologize for the scattered wall of text. This is the first time I've opened up to anyone at such a length and detail.\n\nWith hard work and bullshitting I was able to secure a good city job, getting my CPR and AED first aid and DZ commercial license. I plan to pursue a horticultural degree and become a gardener at the city, that will pay around 33$ with the ability to run a crew and get lead hand 36$/hr. Possibly a real estate license and a course in finance/economics down the road. Currently looking for SAT/SUN work as an arborist, that fell through since covid.\n\nI am ambitious. My ambition is why I choose to live. I want a physique people drool over, I want Fuck you money i can treat myself and family to stuff. I want my dad to know how successful I've become on my own. That we made the right choice without him. I want to say a big fuck you to everyone who ever doubted me or bullied me growing up. I want to FIRE. I want social status and power. I fear I want more than I can achieve and I want to do anything to get it. I feel like I'm running out of time and I'm going to blink and be 30 years old and aging without a woman that loves me and without friends or a plan. I want a good night's sleep without my brain keeping me awake with a will to learn and make more money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Current Living situation and Spending:***\n\n**I am a** **26/M Living in Ontario Canada, just north of Toronto (Richmond Hill)**. \n\n**I Live at home with my single mother(54) and younger sister(23).HCOL area.**\n\n**I have no debt.**\n\n**I have a credit rating of 840/900.**\n\nI have a job working for my municipality full time as a parks operator 3rd class. **$29.11/hr 1.5% annual raise**, winter months provide the ability to plow streets and sidewalks for overtime/double time plus oncall pay. I make the majority of my money in these months. Pension, healthcare benefits, union  job security, paid vacation (caps at 5 weeks after 20 years). Paid sick leave. I would say I earn between **$60,500-$75,000 Canadian**. I have been working here for 3 years. First 2 years were on contract for $23.00/hr. **Sadly i do not have an RRSP contribution match**.  **Looking for weekend work $23.00/hr 64 hours a month.**\n\n**Automobile:**My mom \u201cgave\u201d me her honda accord 2003 with 200k km on it several years ago (i am not on the title). Had to replace the engine and transmission. It's at 330k km and I want to get rid of it sooner than later.\n\nMy mattress, MTB bike, Snowboards, video games and electronics probably hold 10k-20k canadian.\n\nMy mother's house is worth around 1.5M CAD.  purchased 20 years ago for around 400k+\n\nI have a single credit card with RBC, as well as a checking and direct investing account.\n\n**35K candian invested in TFSA holding US stocks: TSLA, SQ, AMD**. \n\n**2k in RRSP :VGRO (CAD)**\n\n**3k in Omers pension so far**\n\n**Rent** :750$ cash to mom\n\n**Groceries** :300-500$/month\n\n**Internet / TV/Cell Phone** :$120 \n\n**Car Insurance**: $165/month \n\n**Gas**$50/month\n\nWhatever is left over I have been dumping into the stock market in blue chip/value growth stocks. I tried to get into the stock market before the crash but rbc took 1 month to approve my margin/tfsa/rrsp direct investing accounts. On april 12th i entered the market on TSLA at $625 US with the majority of my capital.\n\nMy goal portfolio will consist of: ENPH, TSLA, SEDG, TSM, NVDA, QCOM, AMD, SHOP, AMZN, GOOG, FB, MSFT, AAPL, GILD, SQ, NFLX, ROKU, KTOV, CSIQ, CRSP, CGEN, RUN, JKS, PRLB, NVTA, TWOU, ON, AZRE, REGI, MELI, FSLR, ILMN, VWDRY, NOVA, VOO, VGRO, ARKK, ARKG, ARKW, ARKF.  \n\nI am planning on buying and holding as long as possible. 10-20 years. I would appreciate some insight on what order to buy, as i'm currently knocking these off the list per pay cheque on whatever is in the red. I'm sure some of you will disagree with some of my picks. Half of the picks in my list I am still doing my due diligence on and this may not be the final portfolio product.\n\nI was told i can ask my employment to withhold my income tax deductions and pay me in full? At the end of the year I will be responsible for making the income tax payments myself. I see it as an opportunity to be making more money off interest and potential market gains sooner.\n\nMy goal is to buy a condo at yonge and hwy 7 as the extend the TTC subway up to the Richmond Hill center of transportation. I feel like southern Richmond Hill will look like Toronto in no time. Eventually buy property in the neighboring boroughs of the GTA farther North East and West, while their population and infrastructure is lower.\n\nI would like to have 2 jobs and be a landlord at the same time if i can eventually buy property. I would like to find a partner or friend to increase our buying power.\n\nThis was a mixed post of finance, life story reflection and seeking opinion.", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 683282, "public", "self", "26 Need stock and investment advice.

And now I feel like my mom has been poisoned into being toxic by being mistreated and her decaying health.\n\nShe started taking out her misery on me when I was an older teenager. The court battles were not over. Skipping school and becoming careless I just wanted to get away from it all, my slipping grades and poor attendance were ammunition for my dad against her. Him paying child support was conditional that i was a student and a dependent, he owed her thousands towards my sisters schooling costs and retroactive child support. My sister and myself are extremely intelligent. I am more of a hands-on learner. My sister is quite the academic. She is multilingual and  was enrolled in a french immersion private school from grades 6-8. Doing accelerated classes. Paid for by a family friend of my moms from her old company. He is somewhat like a grandfather towards us. She has also completed 2 or 3 university and college programs. Her latest program was supposed to be linked with an employment or intern position in communications and human resources but COVID-19 fucked that all up.\n\nI hung out with anyone who would put up with me\u2026 I didn't know how to socialize, I ate food that made me feel good, I smoked weed constantly and I played video games. Video Games saved me from the bad influences I was hanging out with (kids doing hard drugs, selling drugs, getting into fights). Video games was the one thing I was good at, that I could show the world I had skill in something. I played competitive games, that's all I cared about.   I was gaining a lot of weight in my teenage years, which still affects my physique today. I can gain fat back extremely quickly even though I managed to get into good shape and quit smoking weed for a  year and a half. No father and living with 2 women while being an introvert and a loner, did not help me with women. I was happy to lose my virginity at 18 after getting hard into the gym and getting into shape to some yolo party chick. RIP so many missed sexual advances growing up. Thankfully I had blonde hair and green eyes and nice features before I started gaining weight and eventually losing my hair. Probably a mix between starving myself to  lose weight fast and poor nutrition, high stress and wearing a lot of hats growing up. Falling in and out of the gym after 20 and being in relationships with some poorly selected ladies I started smoking a lot of weed again, putting back on the weight and getting weak. \n\nFound someone willing to pay me for Working construction. And I got a side job as a server. I was able to save up 40k cash. I ended up giving it to my mom for rent for the next few years. Construction was 6AM-6PM 7 days a week cash. And i would work a few hours after that at a restaurant.  This was not sustainable. I ended up getting really stressed out and went back into living in my room playing video games with my rent taken care of. (i really wish i had invested that money and found a new job) \n\nThis is getting too long, and I apologize for the scattered wall of text. This is the first time I've opened up to anyone at such a length and detail.\n\nWith hard work and bullshitting I was able to secure a good city job, getting my CPR and AED first aid and DZ commercial license. I plan to pursue a horticultural degree and become a gardener at the city, that will pay around 33$ with the ability to run a crew and get lead hand 36$/hr. Possibly a real estate license and a course in finance/economics down the road. Currently looking for SAT/SUN work as an arborist, that fell through since covid.\n\nI am ambitious. My ambition is why I choose to live. I want a physique people drool over, I want Fuck you money i can treat myself and family to stuff. I want my dad to know how successful I've become on my own. That we made the right choice without him. I want to say a big fuck you to everyone who ever doubted me or bullied me growing up. I want to FIRE. I want social status and power. I fear I want more than I can achieve and I want to do anything to get it. I feel like I'm running out of time and I'm going to blink and be 30 years old and aging without a woman that loves me and without friends or a plan. I want a good night's sleep without my brain keeping me awake with a will to learn and make more money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Current Living situation and Spending:***\n\n**I am a** **26/M Living in Ontario Canada, just north of Toronto (Richmond Hill)**. \n\n**I Live at home with my single mother(54) and younger sister(23).HCOL area.**\n\n**I have no debt.**\n\n**I have a credit rating of 840/900.**\n\nI have a job working for my municipality full time as a parks operator 3rd class. **$29.11/hr 1.5% annual raise**, winter months provide the ability to plow streets and sidewalks for overtime/double time plus oncall pay. I make the majority of my money in these months. Pension, healthcare benefits, union  job security, paid vacation (caps at 5 weeks after 20 years). Paid sick leave. I would say I earn between **$60,500-$75,000 Canadian**. I have been working here for 3 years. First 2 years were on contract for $23.00/hr. **Sadly i do not have an RRSP contribution match**.  **Looking for weekend work $23.00/hr 64 hours a month.**\n\n**Automobile:**My mom \u201cgave\u201d me her honda accord 2003 with 200k km on it several years ago (i am not on the title). Had to replace the engine and transmission. It's at 330k km and I want to get rid of it sooner than later.\n\nMy mattress, MTB bike, Snowboards, video games and electronics probably hold 10k-20k canadian.\n\nMy mother's house is worth around 1.5M CAD.  purchased 20 years ago for around 400k+\n\nI have a single credit card with RBC, as well as a checking and direct investing account.\n\n**35K candian invested in TFSA holding US stocks: TSLA, SQ, AMD**. \n\n**2k in RRSP :VGRO (CAD)**\n\n**3k in Omers pension so far**\n\n**Rent** :750$ cash to mom\n\n**Groceries** :300-500$/month\n\n**Internet / TV/Cell Phone** :$120 \n\n**Car Insurance**: $165/month \n\n**Gas**$50/month\n\nWhatever is left over I have been dumping into the stock market in blue chip/value growth stocks. I tried to get into the stock market before the crash but rbc took 1 month to approve my margin/tfsa/rrsp direct investing accounts. On april 12th i entered the market on TSLA at $625 US with the majority of my capital.\n\nMy goal portfolio will consist of: ENPH, TSLA, SEDG, TSM, NVDA, QCOM, AMD, SHOP, AMZN, GOOG, FB, MSFT, AAPL, GILD, SQ, NFLX, ROKU, KTOV, CSIQ, CRSP, CGEN, RUN, JKS, PRLB, NVTA, TWOU, ON, AZRE, REGI, MELI, FSLR, ILMN, VWDRY, NOVA, VOO, VGRO, ARKK, ARKG, ARKW, ARKF.  \n\nI am planning on buying and holding as long as possible. 10-20 years. I would appreciate some insight on what order to buy, as i'm currently knocking these off the list per pay cheque on whatever is in the red. I'm sure some of you will disagree with some of my picks. Half of the picks in my list I am still doing my due diligence on and this may not be the final portfolio product.\n\nI was told i can ask my employment to withhold my income tax deductions and pay me in full? At the end of the year I will be responsible for making the income tax payments myself. I see it as an opportunity to be making more money off interest and potential market gains sooner.\n\nMy goal is to buy a condo at yonge and hwy 7 as the extend the TTC subway up to the Richmond Hill center of transportation. I feel like southern Richmond Hill will look like Toronto in no time. Eventually buy property in the neighboring boroughs of the GTA farther North East and West, while their population and infrastructure is lower.\n\nI would like to have 2 jobs and be a landlord at the same time if i can eventually buy property. I would like to find a partner or friend to increase our buying power.\n\nThis was a mixed post of finance, life story reflection and seeking opinion.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 683282, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "26 Need stock and investment advice.

All I need you to do is to suspend disbelief for long enough to consider the facts of the matter.  To engage in civil disagreement and to be receptive to evidence and testing.  I used to think this was not much to ask, March taught me better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've learned those who pretend to be asleep can not be awakened, so at this point I am only talking to those of you who can understand the difference between rational and radical. Sceptical and cynical.   **I'm speaking to the rational sceptics.** The people too  smart to believe what  I say, and not dumb enough to not bother to check if I might just be right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know that most big price moves in the market can be seen before they happen, and that when they happen there will  usually be news that is synchronised along with it. From a casual perspective, the news moves the market; but the move can be seen setting up before the news happens. It is in the charts first, and then it is in the news  later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Listen, I get it!\n\n# I know that sounds dumb.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI absolutely, fully, understand that saying that is just like saying there is an  elephant in the tree. Right away your mind comes up with all the reasons an  elephant can not be in the tree. I GET THAT.  Be sceptical. Doubt what is doubtful,  do not refuse to look.  If you refuse to look, this is ignorance disguised as scepticism. If you can be shown, I can show you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't \"Make sense\", but it does happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Classic Template of a Bubble\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBubbles have always formed in extremely similar ways and anyone who understood how a bubble template worked and remained focused on executing trade plans based upon  that template would have always made a fortune. **This is a fact.** You can dispute if this will  happen again, but upon  full examination of the evidence it is indisputable it was the case for all  previous crashes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"People forecasting market crashes are always wrong!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe the boy who cries wolf has better eye sight.  To see something coming and to time the trades of that thing are really quite different. Picking a top is very hard because no matter what form of analysis you use there will be multiple false signals thrown out.  From all forms of analysis I know of, typically about 3 - 5 false signals come before the real trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 - 5 failed attempts is plenty to lure folks into thinking Cassandras of Wall Street should be mocked without due consideration, but rarely do any of these signals produce sells levels more than 20% off the mark.  The trouble is, in a bull market if you call a bear people will laugh at you for being wrong each time the market goes up 0.05%. Which is why I say a *reasonable* margin or error is required.\n\nFor example, in  late February I said if the Dow breaks under 29,000  [it could start to crash](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/).   That happened, but there are people here who seen me posting daily warning them this was coming (on other platforms) who'll say  my forecasts do not matter because [I was wrong in January.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/)  The market went up 600 points and down 10,000.

In 2000 and 2008 we seen the early 'Bear trap' sections of the bubble and then in the following decade we seen enthusiasm become greed and greed become delusion. The 30% gain in the S&amp;P500 through the year 2019 was the final stages of this bubble.\n\nHere is a post describing us being in the ['Delusion' stage of the bubble in January of 2020](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/).\n\nThe pop of this bubble and the following bear market will not be a nice fast one like the crashes of 2000 and 2008, it will be a more drawn out affair where prices drop far lower. The crash of the 2020's will be more like the crash of the 1930's depression. See the analysis [leading to this conclusion here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/us-indices-bubble-in-style-reflecting-the-great-depression-of-1930/)\n\nIn the months of January and February major US indices traded into the zone where a bubble template would be looking for the top to be made.

There were losing signals on the Dow [around 29,300](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/) and some in [February at 28,900](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/xWSFpsRi-Selling-Dow-28-900/).

This did make it's high on the [exact price first posted.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VYM/BlWd0mFm-Popular-Vanguard-Has-High-Exposure-to-Bad-Market-Conditions/)\n\nIndividual stocks picks done particularly poorly in January. TSLA almost doubled from the first [shorting price of 510.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/FOs1PP5d-Tesla-Could-Breakdown-Soon/) Some did a bit better. [Like shorting T at 39.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/T/IUgQyy8k-AT-T-Vulnerable-Debt-Cash-Flow-Leaks/)\n\nLater in February more sell signals were generated as price traded briefly over important resistance levels. If price broke back under these it would suggest market weakness. These were [170 on VTI](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VTI/IPRCTQh9-VTI-Enters-the-Stubborn-Stage-of-a-Possible-Reversal/) and [29,000 on the Dow.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/) Once these levels were broken the bear market began. In the following days a signal for a [30% drop on the Dow Jones came](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/) (and was successful).\n\nIndividual stock picks did much better in February.

A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)\n\nIn the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.\n\nOn the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.\n\nApril of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&amp;P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).\n\nToday is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February. It's the right idea, but it's just the wrong time.

To see something coming and to time the trades of that thing are really quite different. Picking a top is very hard because no matter what form of analysis you use there will be multiple false signals thrown out.  From all forms of analysis I know of, typically about 3 - 5 false signals come before the real trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 - 5 failed attempts is plenty to lure folks into thinking Cassandras of Wall Street should be mocked without due consideration, but rarely do any of these signals produce sells levels more than 20% off the mark.

A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)\n\nIn the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.\n\nOn the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.\n\nApril of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&amp;P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).\n\nToday is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February. It's the right idea, but it's just the wrong time.

The second leg of the move will be bigger than the first one.  The low of the next drop can be under 50% from the high, and all the reasons people say that can't happen they said for the 2019 low breaking in  January, 2020.

Your warning sign of this is going to be the arrival of bad news in the coming week and a fall down to break the low of March.

In 2000 and 2008 we seen the early 'Bear trap' sections of the bubble and then in the following decade we seen enthusiasm become greed and greed become delusion. The 30% gain in the S&amp;P500 through the year 2019 was the final stages of this bubble.\n\nHere is a post describing us being in the ['Delusion' stage of the bubble in January of 2020](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/).\n\nThe pop of this bubble and the following bear market will not be a nice fast one like the crashes of 2000 and 2008, it will be a more drawn out affair where prices drop far lower. The crash of the 2020's will be more like the crash of the 1930's depression. See the analysis [leading to this conclusion here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/us-indices-bubble-in-style-reflecting-the-great-depression-of-1930/)\n\nIn the months of January and February major US indices traded into the zone where a bubble template would be looking for the top to be made.

[Like shorting T at 39.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/T/IUgQyy8k-AT-T-Vulnerable-Debt-Cash-Flow-Leaks/)\n\nLater in February more sell signals were generated as price traded briefly over important resistance levels.

Once we'd seen the drop  of March what was to be expected was a bounce from the low and a [strong rally up to about 25,000  on the Dow peppered with positive news events.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/)  All  of us who know how to trade have been waiting for that.\n\nThe market crash is going to be brutal. The second leg of the move will be bigger than the first one.  The low of the next drop can be under 50% from the high, and all the reasons people say that can't happen they said for the 2019 low breaking in  January, 2020.   A time when a 0.5% drop was considered buying the dip.\n\nWhat has taken weeks to go up will take hours to come down.  [A headline will come from no-where](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gatjxp/whatever_it_is_will_be_on_the_news/) and everything you think you know one day means nothing tomorrow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've done a lot of work on this trade.  How a trend fails and reverses is something I know a lot about. Whatever you do as an occupation and hobby - I know as much about this as you do about that. This is both my job and passion.  [I'm betting a lot of money on it,](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gbq6eu/big_short_end_of_day_3/) and I got my money by being really good at betting money in markets.\n\nI think the market is setting up to wipe people out.  Your warning sign of this is going to be the arrival of bad news in the coming week and a fall down to break the low of March. Around this time the news may seem to get better - but this will be your final chance to get out at a cheap loss (and yes, I consider a March low exit cheap relative to what June can bring).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying my forecasts are perfect. They are not, but they really have been good enough to do sensationally well during 2020. I've been short from feb. Long during early April and built up a short in the 24,000 - 25,000 Dow range.   I'll paste below a walk through of analysis and trades to this point. If you care to, you can check the accuracy of it and decide how useful my perspective is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\nFind a three year forecast of the [Dow Jones bear market of the 2020's here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/three-year-forecast-of-dow-jones-crash/)\n\n\\---\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe US indices have been [forming a bubble](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/02/29/formingbubbles/) over the last 50 years. In 2000 and 2008 we seen the early 'Bear trap' sections of the bubble and then in the following decade we seen enthusiasm become greed and greed become delusion. The 30% gain in the S&amp;P500 through the year 2019 was the final stages of this bubble.\n\nHere is a post describing us being in the ['Delusion' stage of the bubble in January of 2020](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/).\n\nThe pop of this bubble and the following bear market will not be a nice fast one like the crashes of 2000 and 2008, it will be a more drawn out affair where prices drop far lower. The crash of the 2020's will be more like the crash of the 1930's depression. See the analysis [leading to this conclusion here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/us-indices-bubble-in-style-reflecting-the-great-depression-of-1930/)\n\nIn the months of January and February major US indices traded into the zone where a bubble template would be looking for the top to be made. Read about how this method has [worked in previous crashes here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/05/how-technical-analysis-has-signalled-previous-stock-market-highs-and-now-again-in-2020/) First forecasts in late January were mostly stopped out. There were losing signals on the Dow [around 29,300](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/) and some in [February at 28,900](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/xWSFpsRi-Selling-Dow-28-900/). Individual stocks shorts done poorly, One exception was the Vanguard dividends index VYM. This did make it's high on the [exact price first posted.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VYM/BlWd0mFm-Popular-Vanguard-Has-High-Exposure-to-Bad-Market-Conditions/)\n\nIndividual stocks picks done particularly poorly in January. TSLA almost doubled from the first [shorting price of 510.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/FOs1PP5d-Tesla-Could-Breakdown-Soon/) Some did a bit better. [Like shorting T at 39.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/T/IUgQyy8k-AT-T-Vulnerable-Debt-Cash-Flow-Leaks/)\n\nLater in February more sell signals were generated as price traded briefly over important resistance levels. If price broke back under these it would suggest market weakness. These were [170 on VTI](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VTI/IPRCTQh9-VTI-Enters-the-Stubborn-Stage-of-a-Possible-Reversal/) and [29,000 on the Dow.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/) Once these levels were broken the bear market began. In the following days a signal for a [30% drop on the Dow Jones came](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/) (and was successful).\n\nIndividual stock picks did much better in February. High prices were signalled in [MSFT](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/MSFT/LWCMh0jH-Microsoft-Setting-Up-For-Hard-Landing/), [BRK](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BRK.A/bHDf6D7j-Buffet-s-the-King-of-the-Bag-Holders/), [SPCE](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPCE/uFAroqOi-SPCE-and-Gravity/), [GOOG](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/GOOG/m56g98mU-Weekly-Bearish-Butterfly-Pattern/). A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)\n\nIn the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.\n\nOn the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.\n\nApril of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&amp;P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).\n\nToday is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February. It's the right idea, but it's just the wrong time.

Most people actually start of trading penny stocks as opposed to what are known as *\"blue chip stocks.\"* Like anything else, there are pros and cons to each. I wanted to share this post to talk about some of the misconceptions of penny stocks, and explain why I personally focus on them with my own day trading.\n\nFirst, **what even is a penny stock?** No... penny stocks are not just stocks worth a single penny and no they're not just stocks worth less than $1.00. By definition, any stock priced below $5.00 per share is considered a penny stock.\n\nPenny stocks are priced low for a reason. They're *usually* the stock of a lesser-know company with not-so-reliable reputation to their shareholders. That's why they have such a bad reputation in general, and is why a lot of people think trading penny stocks is pure gambling. At the end of the day, penny stocks offer day traders a lot more than most blue chip stocks offer.\n\nA **blue chip stock** is the stock of a huge company with a great reputation. These are stocks like Apple ($AAPL), Amazon ($AMZN), Google ($GOOG), Facebook ($FB), etc... basically \"household name\" companies. Although these seem like the better investment options, they're not necessarily going to be the better option for an average trader.\n\n**Penny Stock Pros:**\n\n**Higher Volatility:** Penny stocks generally have much higher volatility than blue chip stocks, making them more high risk, high reward. A certain amount of volatility is needed for day trading! Without it there is not enough price movement to be able to get in and out of positions within the day like day traders do. The high volatility in the penny stock market is the reason traders are able to make 10%, 20%, even 50% or more in a single day... a *very* rare occurrence in the blue chip market.\n\n**Less Money Needed:** With penny stocks you may be able to buy 1,000s of shares at a time with a small account when you'd only be able to buy a few shares of a blue chip stock. Because of the extra volatility in the penny stock market, your 1,000 share penny stock investment has potential for a greater return than your 1,000 share blue chip investment... even though you\u2019d be investing far more capital into the blue chip stock. With that being said, penny stocks are usually looked at as the much better option for new traders with limited capital to start trading. In fact, that why most new traders do end up starting with penny stocks, which leads me to the third \"pro.\"\n\n**Less \"Competition\":** Your competition in the stock market is every single other buyer and seller. Everyone is competing against each other to get the best prices and to buy low and sell high for a profit. When one person loses money, another gains! *So..*. would you rather be competing against multi-billion dollar funds and investment firms in the blue chip market, or a herd on new traders with little-to-no experience in the penny stock market? Now that's not to say there aren't still investment firms and algorithmic trading taking place in the penny stock market, but it is less common than it is in the blue chip market.\n\n**Penny Stock Cons:**\n\n**Higher Volatility:** A double-edged sword. As I already mentioned above, the higher volatility of the penny stock market can definitely be a big benefit, but if you're not careful it can also cause larger losses than you would experience with less volatility. This is why risk management and proper position sizing is crucial, especially when trading stocks with high volatility.\n\n**Less Volume:** This is one of the concerns that most traders bring up when they talk about why they don't trade penny stocks. In my opinion, this doesn't make much sense as a \"con\" just for penny stocks, because there are plenty blue chip stocks with low liquidity and volume as well. As day traders, we have to adapt to the market on a daily basis. This means finding the stocks making larger-than-average moves with high relative volume and, usually, news or a press release to go along. Volume is only an issue with day trading penny stocks if you're choosing the wrong penny stocks to day trade.\n\n**Low-Quality Companies:** Again, penny stocks are priced low for a reason. If they were multi-billion dollar companies with years of growing profitability, their stock price would reflect that. It's important to trade the stock, don't fall in love with it! You don't want to invest in a penny stock long-term, because the odds of you picking the next Amazon of Apple are slim to none. Instead, take advantage of the increase volatility brought by the penny stock market for day trading and look to the more reliable blue chip market for your swing trades longer-term investments.\n\nAs you can see, there are definitely some pros and cons to consider before diving into the penny stock market to start day trading.

Most people actually start of trading penny stocks as opposed to what are known as *\"blue chip stocks.\"* Like anything else, there are pros and cons to each. I wanted to share this post to talk about some of the misconceptions of penny stocks, and explain why I personally focus on them with my own day trading.\n\nFirst, **what even is a penny stock?** No... penny stocks are not just stocks worth a single penny and no they're not just stocks worth less than $1.00. By definition, any stock priced below $5.00 per share is considered a penny stock.\n\nPenny stocks are priced low for a reason. They're *usually* the stock of a lesser-know company with not-so-reliable reputation to their shareholders. That's why they have such a bad reputation in general, and is why a lot of people think trading penny stocks is pure gambling. At the end of the day, penny stocks offer day traders a lot more than most blue chip stocks offer.\n\nA **blue chip stock** is the stock of a huge company with a great reputation. These are stocks like Apple ($AAPL), Amazon ($AMZN), Google ($GOOG), Facebook ($FB), etc... basically \"household name\" companies. Although these seem like the better investment options, they're not necessarily going to be the better option for an average trader.\n\n**Penny Stock Pros:**\n\n**Higher Volatility:** Penny stocks generally have much higher volatility than blue chip stocks, making them more high risk, high reward. A certain amount of volatility is needed for day trading! Without it there is not enough price movement to be able to get in and out of positions within the day like day traders do. The high volatility in the penny stock market is the reason traders are able to make 10%, 20%, even 50% or more in a single day... a *very* rare occurrence in the blue chip market.\n\n**Less Money Needed:** With penny stocks you may be able to buy 1,000s of shares at a time with a small account when you'd only be able to buy a few shares of a blue chip stock. With that being said, penny stocks are usually looked at as the much better option for new traders with limited capital to start trading. In fact, that why most new traders do end up starting with penny stocks, which leads me to the third \"pro.\"\n\n**Less \"Competition\":** Your competition in the stock market is every single other buyer and seller. Everyone is competing against each other to get the best prices and to buy low and sell high for a profit. When one person loses money, another gains! *So..*. would you rather be competing against multi-billion dollar funds and investment firms in the blue chip market, or a herd on new traders with little-to-no experience in the penny stock market? Now that's not to say there aren't still investment firms and algorithmic trading taking place in the penny stock market, but it is less common than it is in the blue chip market.\n\n**Penny Stock Cons:**\n\n**Higher Volatility:** A double-edged sword. As I already mentioned above, the higher volatility of the penny stock market can definitely be a big benefit, but if you're not careful it can also cause larger losses than you would experience with less volatility. This is why risk management and proper position sizing is crucial, especially when trading stocks with high volatility.\n\n**Less Volume:** This is one of the concerns that most traders bring up when they talk about why they don't trade penny stocks. In my opinion, this doesn't make much sense as a \"con\" just for penny stocks, because there are plenty blue chip stocks with low liquidity and volume as well. As day traders, we have to adapt to the market on a daily basis. This means finding the stocks making larger-than-average moves with high relative volume and, usually, news or a press release to go along. Volume is only an issue with day trading penny stocks if you're choosing the wrong penny stocks to day trade.\n\n**Low-Quality Companies:** Again, penny stocks are priced low for a reason. If they were multi-billion dollar companies with years of growing profitability, their stock price would reflect that. It's important to trade the stock, don't fall in love with it! You don't want to invest in a penny stock long-term, because the odds of you picking the next Amazon of Apple are slim to none. Instead, take advantage of the increase volatility brought by the penny stock market for day trading and look to the more reliable blue chip market for your swing trades longer-term investments.\n\nAs you can see, there are definitely some pros and cons to consider before diving into the penny stock market to start day trading. If you have the discipline to manage risk properly then they can be a great option to grow a small trading account in a short period of time. *Otherwise,* you may want to take things a bit more slowly by focussing your trading on less volatile, more stable blue chip stocks.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 629399, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Trading Penny Stocks vs. Blue Chip Stocks", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gc865q/trading_penny_stocks_vs_blue_chip_stocks/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1588429229.0}], [[], false, "MajinJuuu", null, [], null, "text", "t2_51xpptgu", false, false, [], false, false, 1588429447, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gc7adj/proper_allocationdiversification/", {}, "gc7adj", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 9, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/gc7adj/proper_allocationdiversification/", false, 6, 1588429449, 1, "Love tech, 24 year old investor, holding for the long term (say 10 years or so).

I sold all of mine back in 2016, fearing cuts to entitlement programs would essentially cut their workforce by 30% overnight. Those cuts never came, and now I want back in.  Grocery pickup and delivery has been the future for a while, but COVID seems to have fast tracked that transition. IMO, it will remain highly popular post pandemic, Walmart will expand on it, and 5 years from now &gt;70% of grocery sales will be a direct competition between them and **AMZN**. I'm taking this one as soon as the right opening appears, with the expectation of holding it long term.  \n\n**KO** \\- First share I ever bought, never let it go, added to it over the years, and might be adding more tomorrow.  Not much to say here. It's priced well and has a scheduled earnings report before opening bell on Tues.  The recent relative success of consumer markets (WMT, **AMZN**, **TGT**, COST) leads me to think that will be a positive report, and if I see nothing indicating otherwise, I'll try to stock up and ride the wave.  Big fan of **PEP** as well -- more diversified than **KO**, but KFC/Tacobell/PH will probably slow any aggressive gains for a while.\n\n**MSFT** \\- Grain of salt time. This is my favorite holding on the market, bar none. **MSFT** and **AMZN** have essentially held up the whole average during this rebound period. It's all about those beautiful beautiful clouds y'all. (military contracts don't hurt either, see **BA**...) It's always a good time to buy Microsoft. \n\nGOOG/**GOOGL** \\- has a bright future in similar areas to **MSFT**, but I hate companies that live and die by advertisement revenue. For that reason I have a very limited holding in only 1 out of the 2, and I stay away from FB and TWT as well.  ITS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME TO BUY MICROSOFT.\n\nT and **DAL** \\- like Coke, they both have earnings to report this week. I think Delta will produce a decent report which will confuse some who don't fully understand that the pandemic split quarters, and much of the carnage won't be known until the end of Q2. If it does bump up, I'll offload shares and buy back lower in the early summer. **DAL** has the best balance sheet as well as the second best executive team in the whole airline industry, and I don't see it going anywhere. T on the other hand looks to be primed for injury if they report negative earnings.  If they fall back below 26, I'm an AT&amp;T buyer all day long. \n\nNFLX - If it were my money, I'd wait for the (very likely) record high earnings report coming up, ride the wave, and sell high.  I'm not a fan of companies who can't seem to be profitable despite overwhelming popularity. Average NFLX account is accessed by &gt;8 users, but only paid for by 1. New competitors emerging. The whole company model just sketches me out. Go prove me wrong Netflix.... but I'll continue to pass for now.\n\nSNE - Gaming has grown in quarantine, Playstation 5 is set to release in the next 2 months, and the stock still has solid rebound potential from its high. I'm at a solid buy here, and I've never owned it before.... so thats exciting!\n\n**V** and **MC** \\- Every single reputable study shows that the very first debt people default on in a recession is their credit card bill. BE VERY CAREFUL HERE.\n\nTSLA - Volatile, Bullish, Enigmatic.... I have no idea what's happening here.  Tesla fanboy's overwhelming enthusiasm make market predictions hard. I'll buy if it drops below 580 again. Don't own any now. Damn sure wish I did....\n\nOther stuff I like right now - **BA**, **JNJ**, **LOW**, **SAVE**, **TDOC**, MDT, HD, **ABT**\n\nOther stuff I'm neutral on - **PG**, LUV, DIS, **NKE**, SHOP, **AMD**, **Oil stocks** (will likely go even lower next month), and **many many many others**.....\n\nOther stuff I hate right now - **AAPL**, cruise lines, or any company that can't survive another big dip.

Primarily long term investor (5-10 year+)\n\nAAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMD, ENPH, SEDG, FTNT, AMZN, CHGG, TTWO, CHE, ALXN, VEEV, VRTX, MDT, ISRG, COST, LULU, ADBE, BIIB, EQIX, TMO\n\nAlso have about 15% in a S&amp;P ETF\n\nI tried picking stocks primarily on strong balance sheets and financials. Any I should consolidate? Atm, I'm thinking to drop ALXN and maybe TTWO.

If it were a regular brokerage acct., then you could immediately spend your gains, subject to the tax consequences of each trade.\n\n**Where**: \tE-Trade \n\n**When**:    Now, Post Pandemic Crash, during the rebound\n\n**Why**: \tObviously to increase portfolio size and buying power\n\n**Questions**:\n\nWhat am I missing here? Today AMZN went up $100. If I had bought 20 shares, and sold the same day, I would have gained 2k in 1 day. What if you just keep doing that over and over and over?\n\nAMZN is always going to go up. Even if it went down today, it would be up again eventually, so you're always going to gain. What am I missing, here?\n\nI realize there is the issue of settlements.

In February, Alphabet disclosed it brought in $15.1 billion in ads through YouTube in 2019, and $8.9 billion via Google Cloud.\n\nIf there is one company that will initially be hit hardest by ad cutbacks, it\u2019s Google. Up to 40% of its revenue comes from categories hard hit by COVID-19: in-person retail, restaurants, travel, automotive and small businesses. But it is also likely to be the first to rebound because of its market leadership.\n\n**Business in the age of COVID-19:** **Read profiles of how other large companies will be affected by the coronavirus**\n\nGoogle has been here before when it wasn\u2019t named Alphabet. During the recession sparked by the subprime-loan crisis a decade ago, sales remained at single-digit growth for five quarters in a row. Google\u2019s revenue estimates declined at least 15% in 2009 and 2010, with a marginally greater earnings hit, according to an analysis by MKM Partners.\n\nThen again, Google had the field all to itself more than a decade ago, before Facebook Inc. **FB,** **+3.22%**, Snap Inc. **SNAP,** **+9.25%**, and Twitter Inc. **TWTR,** **+8.78%** emerged as online ad rivals.\n\n\u201cBack then, I was told at the time the recovery is quicker than you think it is when you get there, and the strongest companies recover quicker than the weaker ones,\u201d former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said in a Zoom **ZM,** **+3.56%** conference with business executives, investors and media on April 7.\n\nAnalysts seem to agree, painting a picture of short-term pain but a quick recovery for Google.\n\n\u201cWe are modelling a \\[year-over-year\\] decline in Google revenues in Q2 followed by continued acceleration in revenues \\[in the second half\\],\u201d MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni said in an April 3 note. \u201cHowever, we do not expect Google to return to double-digit revenue growth until Q1 \u201921.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put this delicately, use the opportunity of the crisis to reconfigure and ensure the decisions you make now make you stronger when this lifts \u2014 a year or maybe less,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nIn 2008, for example, Google repriced stock options to employees to stabilize its workforce and retain talent.\n\n\u201cIt was the right decision at the time,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nSince the last recession, Google has also acted to diversify its business beyond search ads, with YouTube and Cloud accounting for more than 40% of incremental growth, MKM Partners reported.\n\nAlphabet reports fiscal first-quarter results on April 22.\n\nHow the numbers are changing\n\n**Revenue:** Average analyst expectations for the first quarter were $43.17 billion at the end of 2019, but have declined to $42.08 billion as of April 6. Estimates for Google websites, which account for most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, have declined from $30.32 billion to $29.73 billion in that time period, according to FactSet. For the full year, analysts expect revenue of $181.9 billion.\n\n**Earnings:** Average analyst expectations from FactSet were $12.31 per share at the end of 2019. As of April 6, they were $11.24 per share. For the full year, analysts expect earnings of $48.90 a share.\n\n**Stock movement:** During the first three months of 2020, Class A shares declined 13%. Google crested at $1,519.44 on Feb. 18 and closed at $1,183.19 on April 6.\n\nWhat the company is saying\n\nNot much. Notoriously tight-lipped Alphabet executives haven\u2019t said anything of note \u2014 either in SEC filings, news releases or blog posts \u2014 about the economic impact of coronavirus. What they have shared is mostly about a surge in traffic coursing over its network, prompting it to boost the capacity to handle demands on its network and data centers.\n\n**April 3:** \u201cOur priority now is how to meet the surge in demand,\u201d John Jester, vice president of customer experience at Google Cloud, told MarketWatch in a phone interview.\n\nIn a blog post, Google said traffic on its premium video conferencing property Meet has grown 60% day-over-day and is topping 2 billion minutes a day \u2014 25 times the traffic of a typical day.\n\n**Feb. 4:** Until the last two quarters, Google was conspicuously silent about breaking out revenue figures by product division. During its fiscal fourth quarter, it said YouTube was at $15 billion in annual ad revenue, and Cloud is on a $10 billion revenue run rate.\n\n\u2022 Online advertising is half of the global advertising, and Google has roughly 40% market share of online advertising. The math points toward an inevitable short-term disadvantage to Google, but a speedy recovery because of its clout, according to MKM Partners. \u201cWe expect Google advertising revenues to decelerate from \u2018high teens\u2019 (18% to 20%) during 2019 to 4% in 1Q:20, -1% in 2Q:20, and approx. +4% in 4Q20. We are raising our Google Cloud revenue assumptions as we expect a continued acceleration in the cloud, driven by sales force expansion and healthier end markets.\u201d \u2014 **MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni**, maintained his buy rating while trimming Alphabet\u2019s price target to $1,400 from $1,600 on April 3.\n\n\u2022 \u201cWe expect Google to have a greater near-term disadvantage but also have a faster recovery as pandemic effects reduce... We believe Alphabet will be more resilient vs. Facebook in weathering the advertising decline due to its lower exposure to the \\[small business\\] advertiser base. As a result of these top-line changes, our 2020 GAAP EPS estimate is now $40.56 (vs. prior estimate of $53.47) and our 2021 GAAP EPS is now $54.30 (vs. a prior estimate of $66.\u201d \u2014 **Citi analyst Jason Bazinet**, maintained a buy rating while trimming Alphabet\u2019s price target to $1,400 from $1,700 on April 1", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 587384, "public", "self", "Alphabet in the age of COVID-19: Google braved one recession, and now it\u2019s more diversified", 0, [], "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fxfxv7/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", "all_ads", 6, 1586379879.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "adamjonasbrother", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5wz7ou4w", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1586383479, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fxfxv7/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fxfxv7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/fxfxv7/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1586390327, "score": 0, "selftext": " \n\n# Alphabet in the age of COVID-19: Google braved one recession, and now it\u2019s more diversified\n\nWhile online-ad rivals like Facebook and Twitter were still startups with no revenue to speak of in the last recession, former Google CEO says search giant learned some lessons\n\n*This article is part of a series tracking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on major businesses and will be updated.

Estimates for Google websites, which account for most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, have declined from $30.32 billion to $29.73 billion in that time period, according to FactSet. For the full year, analysts expect revenue of $181.9 billion.\n\n**Earnings:** Average analyst expectations from FactSet were $12.31 per share at the end of 2019. As of April 6, they were $11.24 per share. For the full year, analysts expect earnings of $48.90 a share.\n\n**Stock movement:** During the first three months of 2020, Class A shares declined 13%. Google crested at $1,519.44 on Feb. 18 and closed at $1,183.19 on April 6.\n\nWhat the company is saying\n\nNot much. Notoriously tight-lipped Alphabet executives haven\u2019t said anything of note \u2014 either in SEC filings, news releases or blog posts \u2014 about the economic impact of coronavirus. What they have shared is mostly about a surge in traffic coursing over its network, prompting it to boost the capacity to handle demands on its network and data centers.\n\n**April 3:** \u201cOur priority now is how to meet the surge in demand,\u201d John Jester, vice president of customer experience at Google Cloud, told MarketWatch in a phone interview.\n\nIn a blog post, Google said traffic on its premium video conferencing property Meet has grown 60% day-over-day and is topping 2 billion minutes a day \u2014 25 times the traffic of a typical day.\n\n**Feb. 4:** Until the last two quarters, Google was conspicuously silent about breaking out revenue figures by product division. During its fiscal fourth quarter, it said YouTube was at $15 billion in annual ad revenue, and Cloud is on a $10 billion revenue run rate.\n\n\u2022 Online advertising is half of the global advertising, and Google has roughly 40% market share of online advertising. The math points toward an inevitable short-term disadvantage to Google, but a speedy recovery because of its clout, according to MKM Partners. \u201cWe expect Google advertising revenues to decelerate from \u2018high teens\u2019 (18% to 20%) during 2019 to 4% in 1Q:20, -1% in 2Q:20, and approx. +4% in 4Q20. We are raising our Google Cloud revenue assumptions as we expect a continued acceleration in the cloud, driven by sales force expansion and healthier end markets.\u201d \u2014 **MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni**, maintained his buy rating while trimming Alphabet\u2019s price target to $1,400 from $1,600 on April 3.\n\n\u2022 \u201cWe expect Google to have a greater near-term disadvantage but also have a faster recovery as pandemic effects reduce... We believe Alphabet will be more resilient vs. Facebook in weathering the advertising decline due to its lower exposure to the \\[small business\\] advertiser base. As a result of these top-line changes, our 2020 GAAP EPS estimate is now $40.56 (vs. prior estimate of $53.47) and our 2021 GAAP EPS is now $54.30 (vs. a prior estimate of $66.\u201d \u2014 **Citi analyst Jason Bazinet**, maintained a buy rating while trimming Alphabet\u2019s price target to $1,400 from $1,700 on April 1", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 587382, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Alphabet in the age of COVID-19: Google braved one recession, and now it\u2019s more diversified", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fxfwk4/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1586379760.0}], [[], false, "adamjonasbrother", null, [], null, "text", "t2_5wz7ou4w", false, false, [], false, false, 1586383187, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fxfuq7/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", {}, "fxfuq7", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 3, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/fxfuq7/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", false, 6, 1586389987, 0, " \n\n# Alphabet in the age of COVID-19: Google braved one recession, and now it\u2019s more diversified\n\nWhile online-ad rivals like Facebook and Twitter were still startups with no revenue to speak of in the last recession, former Google CEO says search giant learned some lessons\n\n*This article is part of a series tracking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on major businesses and will be updated.

Monday\u2019s rally put the S&amp;P 500 back into positive territory for 2020, and the projected gain for the Dow at the Tuesday open should do the same. Dow futures are currently projecting a 300+ point gain at the open. The Dow needs about 460 more points to erase that Friday slide. (CNBC)\n* The lone economic report out today comes at 10 a.m. ET, when the government issues December factory orders. Though a busy morning for earnings will see the latest numbers from Centene (CNC), Clorox (CLX), McKesson (MCK), Ralph Lauren (RL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Sirius XM (SIRI), among others.\n* Dow component Walt Disney (DIS) grabs the after-the-bell earnings spotlight, with Ford Motor (F), Aflac (AFL), Allstate (ALL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Match Group (MTCH), Seagate Technology (STX) and Snap (SNAP) also among those releasing quarterly numbers. (CNBC)\n* Google parent company Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) shares slid 3% the premarket despite beating earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, as the company came in light on revenue. The tech giant did break out numbers for its YouTube and cloud businesses for the first time, though the disclosure was limited in scope. (CNBC)\n* Google still isn\u2019t telling us about a key metric for YouTube and cloud: Profits (CNBC)\n* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) soared nearly 20% in Monday\u2019s trading after Argus Research raised its price target and short-sellers scrambled to catch up to the stock. The move was the biggest one-day jump since May, 2013. In Tuesday\u2019s premarkets, Tesla stock was trading up nearly 3.4%. (CNBC)\n* Results from the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses were delayed until later today as the state\u2019s Democratic Party said a \u201creporting issue\u201d caused \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in some data. The top 2020 contenders (including Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren) will now focus on the New Hampshire primary one week from today. (CNBC)\n* Buttigieg claims victory in Iowa caucuses, though no results have been released (CNBC)\n* President Donald Trump will be unleashing \u201crelentless optimism\u201d during his third State of the Union address tonight, a speech designed to pivot from his impeachment to his drive for reelection. The theme of his speech: \u201cThe Great American Comeback.\u201d (AP)\n* The Republican-led Senate is poised to acquit Trump in a vote tomorrow afternoon. Yesterday\u2019s closing arguments offered Dems an opportunity to leave the viewing public with two final thoughts: Trump\u2019s actions were craven and corrupt, and that Trump still presents a clear danger to both national security and the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. (CNBC)\n* Hong Kong\u2019s Hospital Authority told CNBC that a 39-year-old man died this morning in the city\u2019s first death related to the coronavirus outbreak.

The deal, if closed, would mark the second tech giant using Goldman as a back-end provider of bank-regulated services. (CNBC)\n* The FTC said it plans to sue to block Edgewell\u2019s $1.37 billion acquisition of shaving start-up Harry\u2019s, citing competition concerns in the consumer shaving space. The deal, announced last May, would give Edgewell access to Harry\u2019s data and subscription base. For Harry\u2019s, it would provide a platform through which to expand beyond its nine factories. (CNBC)\n* Influential right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh announced on his program that he has been diagnosed with \u201cadvanced lung cancer.\u201d Limbaugh, 69, said he will take time off his normal broadcast schedule to seek treatment.

Monday\u2019s rally put the S&amp;P 500 back into positive territory for 2020, and the projected gain for the Dow at the Tuesday open should do the same. Dow futures are currently projecting a 300+ point gain at the open. The Dow needs about 460 more points to erase that Friday slide. (CNBC)\n* The lone economic report out today comes at 10 a.m. ET, when the government issues December factory orders. Though a busy morning for earnings will see the latest numbers from Centene (CNC), Clorox (CLX), McKesson (MCK), Ralph Lauren (RL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Sirius XM (SIRI), among others.\n* Dow component Walt Disney (DIS) grabs the after-the-bell earnings spotlight, with Ford Motor (F), Aflac (AFL), Allstate (ALL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Match Group (MTCH), Seagate Technology (STX) and Snap (SNAP) also among those releasing quarterly numbers. (CNBC)\n* Google parent company Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) shares slid 3% the premarket despite beating earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, as the company came in light on revenue. The tech giant did break out numbers for its YouTube and cloud businesses for the first time, though the disclosure was limited in scope. (CNBC)\n* Google still isn\u2019t telling us about a key metric for YouTube and cloud: Profits (CNBC)\n* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) soared nearly 20% in Monday\u2019s trading after Argus Research raised its price target and short-sellers scrambled to catch up to the stock. The move was the biggest one-day jump since May, 2013. In Tuesday\u2019s premarkets, Tesla stock was trading up nearly 3.4%. (CNBC)\n* Results from the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses were delayed until later today as the state\u2019s Democratic Party said a \u201creporting issue\u201d caused \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in some data. The top 2020 contenders (including Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren) will now focus on the New Hampshire primary one week from today. (CNBC)\n* Buttigieg claims victory in Iowa caucuses, though no results have been released (CNBC)\n* President Donald Trump will be unleashing \u201crelentless optimism\u201d during his third State of the Union address tonight, a speech designed to pivot from his impeachment to his drive for reelection. The theme of his speech: \u201cThe Great American Comeback.\u201d (AP)\n* The Republican-led Senate is poised to acquit Trump in a vote tomorrow afternoon. Yesterday\u2019s closing arguments offered Dems an opportunity to leave the viewing public with two final thoughts: Trump\u2019s actions were craven and corrupt, and that Trump still presents a clear danger to both national security and the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. (CNBC)\n* Hong Kong\u2019s Hospital Authority told CNBC that a 39-year-old man died this morning in the city\u2019s first death related to the coronavirus outbreak. This would be the second known death outside of mainland China. Chinese health officials said earlier that in mainland China the total now sits at 425 deaths and 20,438 confirmed cases.\n* No, garlic won\u2019t protect you from coronavirus: WHO pushes back on rampant misinformation (CNBC)\n* Coronavirus will likely become a pandemic, warns ex-FDA chief Scott Gottlieb (CNBC)\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) is in talks to offer small business loans to merchants on Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) sprawling e-commerce platform. The deal, if closed, would mark the second tech giant using Goldman as a back-end provider of bank-regulated services. (CNBC)\n* The FTC said it plans to sue to block Edgewell\u2019s $1.37 billion acquisition of shaving start-up Harry\u2019s, citing competition concerns in the consumer shaving space. The deal, announced last May, would give Edgewell access to Harry\u2019s data and subscription base. For Harry\u2019s, it would provide a platform through which to expand beyond its nine factories. (CNBC)\n* Influential right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh announced on his program that he has been diagnosed with \u201cadvanced lung cancer.\u201d Limbaugh, 69, said he will take time off his normal broadcast schedule to seek treatment.
