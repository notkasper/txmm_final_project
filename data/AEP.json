Can easily drop to the 50EMA line for a new buy in location. Stoch is oversold.\n\n**$ADC:** Is it a channel, or a triangle? We will see but this is a great buy in price. If it dies, buy in near $62 for easy profit, but can easily run another 10%. \n\n**$AEP:** Great support area, Stoch and RSI are oversold as well. If it doesn't live go long around $79 for an even better value.\n\n**$AMH:** Very easy to see ascending triangle. Buy in any time now, and it should blast up soon for an easy 7-20%. Riding both EMA lines as well, Stochastic oversold.\n\n**$AMRX:** Showing life at the POC Volume Line. Right above all 3 EMA lines, as well -- so this is an extremely strong support area. Go long for some easy money.\n\n**$AOS:** Channel Up play right at a support. May drop to the 200EMA line though, so it has plenty of buy in areas but this one is very strong to go long.\n\n**$ARCT:** If you like run ups this is a technically sound one. Channel up, 50EMA, support a few dollars away/ Bullish Divergence and Stoch oversold should be a good play.\n\n**$ATO:** What a beautiful deal here, can't get too much lower. Stoch shows Divergence and RSI is actually oversold. Great setup!\n\n**$BTG:** Channeling up, strong support area, and over the 50EMA. It is beautiful set up overall.\n\n**$CGEN:** Ran up like I called, now pulling back, this is a strong support area lined up with the 50EMA line. Stoch is oversold, so it has volume ready to roll.\n\n**$DD:** Simple channel up again, above the 50EMA line, but the Stochastic is very oversold, so it has plenty of room to run. May drop to $63 for a resistance retest though.\n\n**$DOC:** Showing higher lows, and still running. POC Lines is very strong support area, and at a good value. Stoch and RSI almost oversold so we may see it dip just a little more. \n\n**$DOCU:** Similar to $DOC, it has room to run down as well. Stoch is almost oversold, but this is basically an ascending triangle -- and it has signs of blasting soon!\n\n**$EMP:** Low risk, low reward triangle but could be a very calm 5% to win. Price action is beautiful otherwise.\n\n**$FR:** Ascending Triangle which I love, and it is neat trend line and support area. It has room to run up though, but I think it may take a day or two of red, then it'll take off. \n\n**$NG:** Support area, mixed with channel up, Stoch over sold showing divergence? Love it go long.\n\n**$OXLC:** Channeling up very well, but may drop to support area near the 200EMA as well. I think it will keep running up, just a matter of when.\n\n**$SXC:** Old trendline resistance becoming a possible support? Love it.
