This earnings season comes at a very interesting time, with the market primed for several market-moving events, including the possibility of vaccine and therapeutic breakthroughs to treat coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS), \u201cNew information on the election, vaccines, and upcoming 3Q earnings represent substantial cross-currents for equities during the next two months. However, the vaccine represents a more important factor than the election result for the recovery in S&amp;P 500 fundamentals.

I don't post much so please excuse the poor formatting and multi-topic post. I plan to post this across a few subreddits. \n\n# I am writing to you guys today because I don't have anyone to give me sound advice. I would like you to review my current position and future trajectory in life. Help me set myself up for financial independence, freedom and hopefully an upper echelon in society. This isn't your traditional financial post. I could probably use  advice in more than one aspect of my life. \n\nTLDR; Weak family beginnings. Abusive absent father, decaying mother. Ambitious son (me) overcame a childhood of loneliness and hardship. I am more mature, responsible and ambitious than everyone else I know at my age group. I feel like I deserve more than I currently have and I need to continue pushing myself to get there to the point I am becoming greedy and frugal.  Skip **Backstory** and go straight to **current living conditions/spending** if you don't care for the long read.\n\n***Backstory:*** \n\nOur Family is weak and unorganized. My dead grandmother died of cancer at 65. She had my mother, aunt and uncle from age 14-16 with my Greek grandfather who was 21 or 22 at the time and left back to Greece. leaving her in Ontario with 3 children. With no education and being a teen mom did not set the next generation up well for the future.\n\nWhen my mother was young she was very smart and did well in elementary and high school,I'm lucky to have a kind mother. My grandmother kicked out  her 3 kids at 18 so she could enjoy the rest of her youth. \n\nThey lived together and all worked 2 jobs to survive. My aunt was a stripper and my mom was a waitress at the same club. I'm not too sure about my uncle. My mom was groped by a drunk patron and the manager did nothing so she quit.\n\nEventually ending up at a good job involving computers in the floppy disc ages at a large company. IT or data entry maybe?  I don't know anything between that time gap, but it's several years. \n\nMy mom met my dad at some company baseball game.  \n\nLittle did she know what a piece of shit he was. He knocked her up and came and went as he pleased, mooching off her for her car, food, condo all which she achieved on her own. I'm assuming my mom was desperate for affection and stability not being close to our grandma and having no dad.\n\nFew years later my sister was born. My dad convinced my mother he wanted to settle down and get married (they didn't). Told her to sell her condo and he would sell his parents house that 6 of his family were living in\u2026 idk how she believed that. As soon as her condo sold he said he wasn't able to sell his house.\n\nWhile my mom was pregnant with my sister she was getting severe stomach pain and colon pain. The doctors brushed it off as pregnancy related pain and said it was normal.\n\nTruth was she had terrible terrible colon cancer and it was bad. My mom doesn't like to talk about her health but she is scarred everywhere from c-sections and surgeries. They caught the cancer late after she gave birth to my sister. My mom had several intense surgeries, not going very smoothly. She has plastic tubing for a colon and osteomy bag, poor circulation.\n\nMy father emptied her bank accounts and stole her car while watching us. Let my RESP payments laps and I ended up losing mine.  (maybe the money is still out there somewhere, my mom says it's gone). When she got out of the hospital she was like 90 pounds and in a wheelchair. Still battling cancer in her late 20\u2019s. My Dad got fed up of looking after us solely and said \u201cthings like its been 2 months since you gave birth when the fuck are you getting out of that chair and going to watch the children?\u201d All this time my mom is on her own. Poor relationships with her mother, sister and brother and she is the smart and responsible one out of the bunch.\n\nShe has benefits at work and is on disability, bought a new house and is raising us alone.Its a good thing she was able to get a mortgage and LOC and credit cards before going on disability, playing off her sickness.\n\nIn and out of court with my dad fighting for child support and sole custody, there is a court order he can pick us up and drop us off every second weekend. They probably hired lawyers and went to court on several occasions. My father has a job with Canada Post, a decent job.\n\nYears go by, my mom is slowly recovering from eating healthy and doing light exercise. My dad convinces her he wants to be in his young kids lives and he made so many mistakes with us and her and that he loves her. She sells her house and buys a bigger house ( the current house we have lived in for 18 years) It doesn't work out, he hasn't changed, she finally learns and realizes and he is gone for good. Several court battles later claiming she is alienating and abusing us from the father. Throwing money at my mom with crooked family lawyers stirring the pot on both sides (several of her own lawyers fucked her). Our whole childhood was robbed with a stressed out overworked sick mother, abusive father towards me and my sister, emotional physical and slight sexual towards my sister.\n\nYears of scraping along and bad lawyers dragging things out ruined my mom. So much stress and no support. She doesn't sleep well and doesn't eat well, it's broken her. I've tried to ask about her health and her finances but she is a private introvert and says it's none of my business. She has been suffering from depression for many years, she tells me she has MS. She is tired all the time, she can't control her emotions. She has a hearing and sight issue. She has poor communication skills and emotional intelligence. I think me and her might be somewhere on the spectrum. At a first glance you wouldn't be able to tell these things about her. Besides her talking very loud all the time not realizing how much louder she is talking than those speaking to her. I could be wrong about myself as well and it may just be that I was poorly socialized as a kid.\n\nI started working at a grocery store at 12 or 13 years old and I have had 1 or 2 jobs at a time since. My mom couldn't afford to give me an allowance, if i needed money i had to work for it.. My mom needed to give the manager of a grocery store a signed letter saying it was legal for him to be hiring me. Growing up I knew not to ask for things from the store, or say what things I liked or wished I had. I remember teaching my little sister the same, constantly telling her we didn't have money for that or it was a waste of money.\n\nI feel emotionless from all the weed I smoked growing up. I was high on marijuana more than I was sober from 14-21 minus the year and a half break I took while aggressively losing weight and doing lots of cardio and weights. 13-17 I got really fat sitting and playing video games eating unhealthy and smoking. I don't get angry, I don't get scared. I am confident in the fact that I don't care what many people think and I don't have time for their laziness or bullshit. My former introverted shy self is gone, but any happiness I feel is short lived and quickly fleeting. I've been depressed for so long  it just feels normal. What keeps me going is my will to finally live financially free and explore what life has to offer, I hope I still have passion when that is all said and done. I want to make a woman happy and to feel wanted and lusted over. I want to pass on a hard work ethic, reason, wisdom, problem solving skills and a financial fortune to a child.\n\nI am not that close with my sister or my mom. Our crucial years of growing together were all ruined. And now I feel like my mom has been poisoned into being toxic by being mistreated and her decaying health.\n\nShe started taking out her misery on me when I was an older teenager. The court battles were not over. Skipping school and becoming careless I just wanted to get away from it all, my slipping grades and poor attendance were ammunition for my dad against her. Him paying child support was conditional that i was a student and a dependent, he owed her thousands towards my sisters schooling costs and retroactive child support. My sister and myself are extremely intelligent. I am more of a hands-on learner. My sister is quite the academic. She is multilingual and  was enrolled in a french immersion private school from grades 6-8. Doing accelerated classes. Paid for by a family friend of my moms from her old company. He is somewhat like a grandfather towards us. She has also completed 2 or 3 university and college programs. Her latest program was supposed to be linked with an employment or intern position in communications and human resources but COVID-19 fucked that all up.\n\nI hung out with anyone who would put up with me\u2026 I didn't know how to socialize, I ate food that made me feel good, I smoked weed constantly and I played video games. Video Games saved me from the bad influences I was hanging out with (kids doing hard drugs, selling drugs, getting into fights). Video games was the one thing I was good at, that I could show the world I had skill in something. I played competitive games, that's all I cared about.   I was gaining a lot of weight in my teenage years, which still affects my physique today. I can gain fat back extremely quickly even though I managed to get into good shape and quit smoking weed for a  year and a half. No father and living with 2 women while being an introvert and a loner, did not help me with women. I was happy to lose my virginity at 18 after getting hard into the gym and getting into shape to some yolo party chick. RIP so many missed sexual advances growing up. Thankfully I had blonde hair and green eyes and nice features before I started gaining weight and eventually losing my hair. Probably a mix between starving myself to  lose weight fast and poor nutrition, high stress and wearing a lot of hats growing up. Falling in and out of the gym after 20 and being in relationships with some poorly selected ladies I started smoking a lot of weed again, putting back on the weight and getting weak. \n\nFound someone willing to pay me for Working construction. And I got a side job as a server. I was able to save up 40k cash. I ended up giving it to my mom for rent for the next few years. Construction was 6AM-6PM 7 days a week cash. And i would work a few hours after that at a restaurant.  This was not sustainable. I ended up getting really stressed out and went back into living in my room playing video games with my rent taken care of. (i really wish i had invested that money and found a new job) \n\nThis is getting too long, and I apologize for the scattered wall of text. This is the first time I've opened up to anyone at such a length and detail.\n\nWith hard work and bullshitting I was able to secure a good city job, getting my CPR and AED first aid and DZ commercial license. I plan to pursue a horticultural degree and become a gardener at the city, that will pay around 33$ with the ability to run a crew and get lead hand 36$/hr. Possibly a real estate license and a course in finance/economics down the road. Currently looking for SAT/SUN work as an arborist, that fell through since covid.\n\nI am ambitious. My ambition is why I choose to live. I want a physique people drool over, I want Fuck you money i can treat myself and family to stuff. I want my dad to know how successful I've become on my own. That we made the right choice without him. I want to say a big fuck you to everyone who ever doubted me or bullied me growing up. I want to FIRE. I want social status and power. I fear I want more than I can achieve and I want to do anything to get it. I feel like I'm running out of time and I'm going to blink and be 30 years old and aging without a woman that loves me and without friends or a plan. I want a good night's sleep without my brain keeping me awake with a will to learn and make more money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Current Living situation and Spending:***\n\n**I am a** **26/M Living in Ontario Canada, just north of Toronto (Richmond Hill)**. \n\n**I Live at home with my single mother(54) and younger sister(23).HCOL area.**\n\n**I have no debt.**\n\n**I have a credit rating of 840/900.**\n\nI have a job working for my municipality full time as a parks operator 3rd class. **$29.11/hr 1.5% annual raise**, winter months provide the ability to plow streets and sidewalks for overtime/double time plus oncall pay. I make the majority of my money in these months. Pension, healthcare benefits, union  job security, paid vacation (caps at 5 weeks after 20 years). Paid sick leave. I would say I earn between **$60,500-$75,000 Canadian**. I have been working here for 3 years.

I tried to get into the stock market before the crash but rbc took 1 month to approve my margin/tfsa/rrsp direct investing accounts.

I would appreciate some insight on what order to buy, as i'm currently knocking these off the list per pay cheque on whatever is in the red. I'm sure some of you will disagree with some of my picks. Half of the picks in my list I am still doing my due diligence on and this may not be the final portfolio product.\n\nI was told i can ask my employment to withhold my income tax deductions and pay me in full? At the end of the year I will be responsible for making the income tax payments myself. I see it as an opportunity to be making more money off interest and potential market gains sooner.\n\nMy goal is to buy a condo at yonge and hwy 7 as the extend the TTC subway up to the Richmond Hill center of transportation. I feel like southern Richmond Hill will look like Toronto in no time.

I don't post much so please excuse the poor formatting and multi-topic post. I plan to post this across a few subreddits. \n\n# I am writing to you guys today because I don't have anyone to give me sound advice. I would like you to review my current position and future trajectory in life. Help me set myself up for financial independence, freedom and hopefully an upper echelon in society. This isn't your traditional financial post. I could probably use  advice in more than one aspect of my life. \n\nTLDR; Weak family beginnings. Abusive absent father, decaying mother. Ambitious son (me) overcame a childhood of loneliness and hardship. I am more mature, responsible and ambitious than everyone else I know at my age group. I feel like I deserve more than I currently have and I need to continue pushing myself to get there to the point I am becoming greedy and frugal.  Skip **Backstory** and go straight to **current living conditions/spending** if you don't care for the long read.\n\n***Backstory:*** \n\nOur Family is weak and unorganized. My dead grandmother died of cancer at 65. She had my mother, aunt and uncle from age 14-16 with my Greek grandfather who was 21 or 22 at the time and left back to Greece. leaving her in Ontario with 3 children. With no education and being a teen mom did not set the next generation up well for the future.\n\nWhen my mother was young she was very smart and did well in elementary and high school,I'm lucky to have a kind mother. My grandmother kicked out  her 3 kids at 18 so she could enjoy the rest of her youth. \n\nThey lived together and all worked 2 jobs to survive. My aunt was a stripper and my mom was a waitress at the same club. I'm not too sure about my uncle. My mom was groped by a drunk patron and the manager did nothing so she quit.\n\nEventually ending up at a good job involving computers in the floppy disc ages at a large company. IT or data entry maybe?  I don't know anything between that time gap, but it's several years. \n\nMy mom met my dad at some company baseball game.  \n\nLittle did she know what a piece of shit he was. He knocked her up and came and went as he pleased, mooching off her for her car, food, condo all which she achieved on her own. I'm assuming my mom was desperate for affection and stability not being close to our grandma and having no dad.\n\nFew years later my sister was born. My dad convinced my mother he wanted to settle down and get married (they didn't). Told her to sell her condo and he would sell his parents house that 6 of his family were living in\u2026 idk how she believed that. As soon as her condo sold he said he wasn't able to sell his house.\n\nWhile my mom was pregnant with my sister she was getting severe stomach pain and colon pain. The doctors brushed it off as pregnancy related pain and said it was normal.\n\nTruth was she had terrible terrible colon cancer and it was bad. My mom doesn't like to talk about her health but she is scarred everywhere from c-sections and surgeries. They caught the cancer late after she gave birth to my sister. My mom had several intense surgeries, not going very smoothly. She has plastic tubing for a colon and osteomy bag, poor circulation.\n\nMy father emptied her bank accounts and stole her car while watching us. Let my RESP payments laps and I ended up losing mine.  (maybe the money is still out there somewhere, my mom says it's gone). When she got out of the hospital she was like 90 pounds and in a wheelchair. Still battling cancer in her late 20\u2019s. My Dad got fed up of looking after us solely and said \u201cthings like its been 2 months since you gave birth when the fuck are you getting out of that chair and going to watch the children?\u201d All this time my mom is on her own. Poor relationships with her mother, sister and brother and she is the smart and responsible one out of the bunch.\n\nShe has benefits at work and is on disability, bought a new house and is raising us alone.Its a good thing she was able to get a mortgage and LOC and credit cards before going on disability, playing off her sickness.\n\nIn and out of court with my dad fighting for child support and sole custody, there is a court order he can pick us up and drop us off every second weekend. They probably hired lawyers and went to court on several occasions. My father has a job with Canada Post, a decent job.\n\nYears go by, my mom is slowly recovering from eating healthy and doing light exercise. My dad convinces her he wants to be in his young kids lives and he made so many mistakes with us and her and that he loves her. She sells her house and buys a bigger house ( the current house we have lived in for 18 years) It doesn't work out, he hasn't changed, she finally learns and realizes and he is gone for good. Several court battles later claiming she is alienating and abusing us from the father. Throwing money at my mom with crooked family lawyers stirring the pot on both sides (several of her own lawyers fucked her). Our whole childhood was robbed with a stressed out overworked sick mother, abusive father towards me and my sister, emotional physical and slight sexual towards my sister.\n\nYears of scraping along and bad lawyers dragging things out ruined my mom. So much stress and no support. She doesn't sleep well and doesn't eat well, it's broken her. I've tried to ask about her health and her finances but she is a private introvert and says it's none of my business. She has been suffering from depression for many years, she tells me she has MS. She is tired all the time, she can't control her emotions. She has a hearing and sight issue. She has poor communication skills and emotional intelligence. I think me and her might be somewhere on the spectrum. At a first glance you wouldn't be able to tell these things about her. Besides her talking very loud all the time not realizing how much louder she is talking than those speaking to her. I could be wrong about myself as well and it may just be that I was poorly socialized as a kid.\n\nI started working at a grocery store at 12 or 13 years old and I have had 1 or 2 jobs at a time since. My mom couldn't afford to give me an allowance, if i needed money i had to work for it.. My mom needed to give the manager of a grocery store a signed letter saying it was legal for him to be hiring me. Growing up I knew not to ask for things from the store, or say what things I liked or wished I had. I remember teaching my little sister the same, constantly telling her we didn't have money for that or it was a waste of money.\n\nI feel emotionless from all the weed I smoked growing up. I was high on marijuana more than I was sober from 14-21 minus the year and a half break I took while aggressively losing weight and doing lots of cardio and weights. 13-17 I got really fat sitting and playing video games eating unhealthy and smoking. I don't get angry, I don't get scared. I am confident in the fact that I don't care what many people think and I don't have time for their laziness or bullshit. My former introverted shy self is gone, but any happiness I feel is short lived and quickly fleeting. I've been depressed for so long  it just feels normal. What keeps me going is my will to finally live financially free and explore what life has to offer, I hope I still have passion when that is all said and done. I want to make a woman happy and to feel wanted and lusted over. I want to pass on a hard work ethic, reason, wisdom, problem solving skills and a financial fortune to a child.\n\nI am not that close with my sister or my mom. Our crucial years of growing together were all ruined. And now I feel like my mom has been poisoned into being toxic by being mistreated and her decaying health.\n\nShe started taking out her misery on me when I was an older teenager. The court battles were not over. Skipping school and becoming careless I just wanted to get away from it all, my slipping grades and poor attendance were ammunition for my dad against her. Him paying child support was conditional that i was a student and a dependent, he owed her thousands towards my sisters schooling costs and retroactive child support. My sister and myself are extremely intelligent. I am more of a hands-on learner. My sister is quite the academic. She is multilingual and  was enrolled in a french immersion private school from grades 6-8. Doing accelerated classes. Paid for by a family friend of my moms from her old company. He is somewhat like a grandfather towards us. She has also completed 2 or 3 university and college programs. Her latest program was supposed to be linked with an employment or intern position in communications and human resources but COVID-19 fucked that all up.\n\nI hung out with anyone who would put up with me\u2026 I didn't know how to socialize, I ate food that made me feel good, I smoked weed constantly and I played video games. Video Games saved me from the bad influences I was hanging out with (kids doing hard drugs, selling drugs, getting into fights). Video games was the one thing I was good at, that I could show the world I had skill in something. I played competitive games, that's all I cared about.   I was gaining a lot of weight in my teenage years, which still affects my physique today. I can gain fat back extremely quickly even though I managed to get into good shape and quit smoking weed for a  year and a half. No father and living with 2 women while being an introvert and a loner, did not help me with women. I was happy to lose my virginity at 18 after getting hard into the gym and getting into shape to some yolo party chick. RIP so many missed sexual advances growing up. Thankfully I had blonde hair and green eyes and nice features before I started gaining weight and eventually losing my hair. Probably a mix between starving myself to  lose weight fast and poor nutrition, high stress and wearing a lot of hats growing up. Falling in and out of the gym after 20 and being in relationships with some poorly selected ladies I started smoking a lot of weed again, putting back on the weight and getting weak. \n\nFound someone willing to pay me for Working construction. And I got a side job as a server. I was able to save up 40k cash. I ended up giving it to my mom for rent for the next few years. Construction was 6AM-6PM 7 days a week cash. And i would work a few hours after that at a restaurant.  This was not sustainable. I ended up getting really stressed out and went back into living in my room playing video games with my rent taken care of. (i really wish i had invested that money and found a new job) \n\nThis is getting too long, and I apologize for the scattered wall of text. This is the first time I've opened up to anyone at such a length and detail.\n\nWith hard work and bullshitting I was able to secure a good city job, getting my CPR and AED first aid and DZ commercial license. I plan to pursue a horticultural degree and become a gardener at the city, that will pay around 33$ with the ability to run a crew and get lead hand 36$/hr. Possibly a real estate license and a course in finance/economics down the road. Currently looking for SAT/SUN work as an arborist, that fell through since covid.\n\nI am ambitious. My ambition is why I choose to live. I want a physique people drool over, I want Fuck you money i can treat myself and family to stuff. I want my dad to know how successful I've become on my own. That we made the right choice without him. I want to say a big fuck you to everyone who ever doubted me or bullied me growing up. I want to FIRE. I want social status and power. I fear I want more than I can achieve and I want to do anything to get it. I feel like I'm running out of time and I'm going to blink and be 30 years old and aging without a woman that loves me and without friends or a plan. I want a good night's sleep without my brain keeping me awake with a will to learn and make more money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Current Living situation and Spending:***\n\n**I am a** **26/M Living in Ontario Canada, just north of Toronto (Richmond Hill)**. \n\n**I Live at home with my single mother(54) and younger sister(23).HCOL area.**\n\n**I have no debt.**\n\n**I have a credit rating of 840/900.**\n\nI have a job working for my municipality full time as a parks operator 3rd class. **$29.11/hr 1.5% annual raise**, winter months provide the ability to plow streets and sidewalks for overtime/double time plus oncall pay. I make the majority of my money in these months. Pension, healthcare benefits, union  job security, paid vacation (caps at 5 weeks after 20 years). Paid sick leave. I would say I earn between **$60,500-$75,000 Canadian**. I have been working here for 3 years. First 2 years were on contract for $23.00/hr. **Sadly i do not have an RRSP contribution match**.  **Looking for weekend work $23.00/hr 64 hours a month.**\n\n**Automobile:**My mom \u201cgave\u201d me her honda accord 2003 with 200k km on it several years ago (i am not on the title). Had to replace the engine and transmission. It's at 330k km and I want to get rid of it sooner than later.\n\nMy mattress, MTB bike, Snowboards, video games and electronics probably hold 10k-20k canadian.\n\nMy mother's house is worth around 1.5M CAD.  purchased 20 years ago for around 400k+\n\nI have a single credit card with RBC, as well as a checking and direct investing account.\n\n**35K candian invested in TFSA holding US stocks: TSLA, SQ, AMD**. \n\n**2k in RRSP :VGRO (CAD)**\n\n**3k in Omers pension so far**\n\n**Rent** :750$ cash to mom\n\n**Groceries** :300-500$/month\n\n**Internet / TV/Cell Phone** :$120 \n\n**Car Insurance**: $165/month \n\n**Gas**$50/month\n\nWhatever is left over I have been dumping into the stock market in blue chip/value growth stocks. I tried to get into the stock market before the crash but rbc took 1 month to approve my margin/tfsa/rrsp direct investing accounts. On april 12th i entered the market on TSLA at $625 US with the majority of my capital.\n\nMy goal portfolio will consist of: ENPH, TSLA, SEDG, TSM, NVDA, QCOM, AMD, SHOP, AMZN, GOOG, FB, MSFT, AAPL, GILD, SQ, NFLX, ROKU, KTOV, CSIQ, CRSP, CGEN, RUN, JKS, PRLB, NVTA, TWOU, ON, AZRE, REGI, MELI, FSLR, ILMN, VWDRY, NOVA, VOO, VGRO, ARKK, ARKG, ARKW, ARKF.  \n\nI am planning on buying and holding as long as possible. 10-20 years. I would appreciate some insight on what order to buy, as i'm currently knocking these off the list per pay cheque on whatever is in the red. I'm sure some of you will disagree with some of my picks. Half of the picks in my list I am still doing my due diligence on and this may not be the final portfolio product.\n\nI was told i can ask my employment to withhold my income tax deductions and pay me in full? At the end of the year I will be responsible for making the income tax payments myself. I see it as an opportunity to be making more money off interest and potential market gains sooner.\n\nMy goal is to buy a condo at yonge and hwy 7 as the extend the TTC subway up to the Richmond Hill center of transportation. I feel like southern Richmond Hill will look like Toronto in no time. Eventually buy property in the neighboring boroughs of the GTA farther North East and West, while their population and infrastructure is lower.\n\nI would like to have 2 jobs and be a landlord at the same time if i can eventually buy property. I would like to find a partner or friend to increase our buying power.\n\nThis was a mixed post of finance, life story reflection and seeking opinion.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 683282, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "26 Need stock and investment advice.
