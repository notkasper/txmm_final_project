chairman, managing director, and  largest shareholder of [Reliance Industries Ltd.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliance_Industries_Ltd.)  (RIL), a Fortune Global 500 company and India's most valuable company  by market value. He is the second richest person in Asia with a net  worth of US$71.1 billion, and as of 23 December 2020, the 21st richest  in the world. \n\n \n\n## Personal life\n\nHe married Nita Ambani  in 1985 and they have two sons; Anant and Akash, and a daughter,  Isha.They met after his father attended a dance performance which Nita  took  part in and thought of the idea of arranging a marriage between the two.\n\nThey live in Antilia,  a private 27-storey building in Mumbai, which was valued at  US$1\u00a0billion and was the most expensive private residence in the world  at the time it was built.The building requires a staff of 600 for maintenance, and it includes  three helipads, a 160-car garage, private movie theater, swimming pool,  and fitness center. \n\nIn 2007, Ambani gifted his wife a $60 million Airbus A319 for her 44th birthday. The Airbus,  which has a capacity of 180 passengers, has been custom-fitted to  include a living room, bedroom, satellite television, WiFi, sky bar,  Jacuzzi, and an office. \n\nAmbani was titled \"The World's Richest Sports Team Owner\" after  his purchase of the IPL cricket team Mumbai Indians for $111.9 million  in 2008. \n\nIn an interview with Rajdeep Sardesai in March 2017, he said that  his favourite food continued to be idli sambar and his favourite  restaurant remains Mysore Caf\u00e9, a restaurant in King's Circle (Mumbai)  where he used to eat as a student at UDCT.Mukesh Ambani is a strict  vegetarian and teetotaler.

Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.\n\nAdditionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.\n\n**Industry Fundamentals**\n\nGrowth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.\n\nPopularity of gaming is increasing:\n\nAccording to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.\n\nTech-driven improvements in game quality:\n\nAdvances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.\n\nIncreasing gaming and streaming engagement:\n\nSome interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks\u2019 State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:\n\n* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games\n* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves\n* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive\n* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.\n\n**The eSports and streaming flywheel**\n\nThe rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.\n\n# Competitive Landscape &amp; Risks\n\n**Competition**\n\nThe gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair\u2019s product offering includes:\n\n**Gaming keyboards and mice** \\- Logitech and Razer\n\n**Headsets and related audio products** \\-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX\n\n**Streaming gear** \\- Logitech and AVerMedia\n\n**Performance controllers** \\- Microsoft and Logitech\n\n**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \\- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake\n\n**High performance memory** \\- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron\n\n**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \\- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower\n\n**Competitive Strategy**\n\nThe company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.\n\n**Market Share**\n\nAccording to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.\n\n**Growth Strategy**\n\nMove into the Asia Pacific region:\n\nThe Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.\n\nComplimentary acquisitions:\n\nCorsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.\n\nNew Markets:\n\nUses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.\n\n**Threat of New Entrants**\n\nBecause of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).\n\n**Threat of Substitution**\n\nA significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair\u2019s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.\n\nCloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user\u2019s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.\n\nAdditionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.\n\n**Moats**\n\nThere does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair\u2019s market share across their product offering.\n\n**Other Relevant Risks**\n\nDue to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.\n\n#

I have a college fund to pay my tuition, I don\u2019t have to worry about when my next meal is coming, and I have the freedom to spend my money as I choose. \n\nAnyways, in March &amp; April when the market crashed I decided it was time to really dive into the stock market. I spent about 5 hours every day researching companies and I\u2019m here to share what I\u2019ve learned. \n\nIn my opinion, **the** **companies** **you** **invest** **in** **should** **be** **an** **extension** **of** **your** **worldview.** Where do you think the world will be in 10 years+ and what industries will prosper from the change. As I was raised in a liberal family and hold these values, I\u2019m quite concerned with **Climate** **Change**. I\u2019ve taken college classes in this realm since and learned more about the risks we face. I believe that any company whose mission revolves around mitigating the climate crisis will prosper in the coming decades. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ll list the companies I hold and a very brief synopsis of what they do and why I hold their stock. **Please** **do** **your** **own** **research**; this is only meant to introduce young investors to a certain mindset that I hold and the companies that I choose to support. \n\n--------------------------\n\n**Tesla** **(TSLA)** \n\nportfolio weight: **22.86%**\n\ngain/loss **1026%** **gain**\n\nYou guys all know what Tesla is about. They are the premier EV company with goals of cutting battery costs by 56% and producing 20,000,000+ cars in the decade. They also have a growing energy business with solar roofs, panels, battery storage and an autobidder software. Tesla is priced insanely high by traditional metrics. If these metrics are your investing style then it\u2019s not for you. If you\u2019re like me, and you look for companies to hold for decades then I believe Tesla is one of the best investments out there. What other company will benefit from the transition to renewables in response to climate change and changing political conditions?\n\n----------------------------------\n\n**MP** **Materials** **(MP)**\n\nportfolio weight: **12.68%**\n\ngain/loss: **197%**  **gain**\n\nMP is the only active rare earth mineral miner in the U.S. They produce neodymium concentrates which are important components in NDPR magnets; used in EV motors, wind turbines, electronics &amp; much more. \n\nI bought MP during their early pre-merger days and have already seen considerable profits in a few months. I\u2019ve been shaving this position to keep it around 10% because it is a commodity play which can be quite risky. That being said, rare earths are expected to appreciate substantially in price as EV demand increases. Furthermore, MP is moving downstream to refine their rare earths themselves, as they currently ship them to China to be refined, and in the future they plan on manufacturing their own NDPR batteries. This will increase their margins greatly. \n\n----------------------------------\n\n**Planet** **13** **(PLNHF)**\n\nportfolio weight **5.35%**\n\ngain/loss: **147.71** **gain**\n\nThis one is a MJ stock and I\u2019m focusing mostly on my Climate Change investments on this post so I\u2019ll keep it brief. They own a superstore in Vegas and have their own brands. I believe the MJ industry is going to explode soon and PLNHF will benefit. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**Jinko** **Solar** **(JKS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **4.91%**\n\ngain/loss: **268.88%** **gain**\n\nJinko Solar is a leading solar panel manufacturer in China. They\u2019ve seen market consolidation in China and are poised to benefit from increasing demand and incentives around solar energy. Specifically, South East Asia is expected to see dramatic growth in renewables as China/India are responsible for a large portion of global emissions and are also seeing considerable growth in GDP and population. It\u2019s a play on the South East Asian economy and renewable industry. \n\n-------------------------------------\n\n**SolarEdge** **(SEDG)**:\n\nportfolio weight: **4.89%**\n\ngain/loss: **108.5%** **gain**\n\nSolarEdge is the global leader in panel inverters, which turn the sun\u2019s D.C. current into usable electricity for households (A.C. current). The inverter space is a much more consolidated industry with higher margins than panels. They trade at a more expensive multiple and are expected to see dramatic top and bottom line growth in the coming years. Solar panels need inverters to perform; simple as that. With fewer companies focused on this space, I expect the top players to have a large market share and grow along with the solar energy market. SEDG is also expanding into the energy storage and EV charging markets with recent acquisitions. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**Enphase** **Energy** **(ENPH)**\n\nportfolio weight: **4.43%** \n\ngain/loss: **203.08%** **gain**\n\nEnphase is also in the inverter market, with their differentiated microinverters. Micro Inverters are generally used in smaller systems and optimal for residential solar. Everything said above about the inverter market is true for Enphase as well. Enphase\u2019s business goes beyond inverters though. They are targeting a full residential energy ecosystem, with storage and their \u201cEnlighten\u201d software App, which will manage home energy usage and sell excess energy back to the grid. Enphase is very much a play on a future decentralized microgrid, with homes trading energy to each other as prices fluctuate. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**Canadian** **Solar** **(CSIQ)**\n\nportfolio weight: **4.42%**\n\ngain/loss: **118.32%** *gain**\n\nCanadian Solar is another panel manufacturing company. They are also seeing growth in market share as smaller players struggle during the pandemic. CSIQ is a low cost producer with residential, commercial and grid level projects. They are planning on expanding their recurring revenue stream through full and partial ownership of solar projects. You can read more about this on the IR page. CSIQ is a pure solar play with an international footprint and vast management expertise. They will certainly benefit from any movement towards renewables, especially if legislation is passed to set a price on carbon. \n\n--------------------------\n\n**Lemonade** **LMND** \n\nportfolio weight: **3.93%**\n\ngain/loss: **112.52** **gain**\n\nLemonade is not a climate change related investment. It\u2019s highly speculative but I think their management team and business model is really cool so I put some money in (and quickly more than doubled it). I\u2019ll be brief here, but basically they are a home/renter/pet insurance company that takes a flat 25% cut of premiums as revenue and uses the remaining money to pay out claims. They aim to align incentives by donating anything left over beyond the 25% to a charity of customers choosing. Also, their use of AI makes the registration and claims process seamless and \u201cdelights\u201d customers. \n\n----------------------------\n\n**TPI** **Composites** **(TPIC)**\n\nportfolio weight: **3.73%**\n\ngain/loss: **153.99%** **gain**\n\nTPIC manufacturers wind blade composites. They supply the top five wind turbine companies outside of China. I wrote about them on prior posts so I\u2019ll just copy &amp; paste here:\n63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with Workhorse to manufacture vehicle parts for them.\n-----------------------------\n\n**Skyworks** **Solutions** **(SWKS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.83%**\n\ngain/loss: **60.57%** **gain**\n\nSkyworks is a semiconductor focused on connectivity chips for all kinds of devices. They aren\u2019t climate change related which is the point of this post so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Tattooed** **Chef** **(TTCF)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.65%**\n\ngain/loss: **55.90** **gain**\n\nTattooed Chef is a play on the rising plant-based food trend. They make a variety of frozen food items, widely available in Walmart, Costco and Target. They are expanding into Whole Foods, Trader Joe\u2019s and many more stores, where I expect them to be very successful. The plant based market is exploding for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there is more research on the health benefits of a plant based diet, with athletes such as Chris Paul &amp; Todd Gurley endorsing these brands. Also, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the threat of climate change and how avoiding red meat can have a positive impact on the planet. I expect TTCF to benefit off of these trends and continue innovating in the plant-based space. I bought in 3 weeks ago and the price has exploded since then. \n\n-------------------------\n\n**Workhorse** **(WKHS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.60%**\n\ngain/loss: **35.90%** **gain**\n\nWorkhorse is an electric delivery van company. They manufacture last mile electric vehicles and are developing drones to further decrease last mile delivery costs. They are a play on the e-commerce industry and electrification of vehicles. I\u2019m invested in them because last mile delivery is responsible for a large chunk of transportation carbon emissions and in desperate need of electrification. I also believe that Workhorse will get a large chunk of the upcoming USPS contract which will provide a stable revenue stream.\n---------------------\n\n**Aphria** **(APHA)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.45%**\n\ngain/loss: **53%** **gain**\n\nAphria is another MJ play for me. Once again they aren\u2019t a climate change investment so I\u2019ll keep it brief. They just finalized a merger with Tilray, making them the biggest cannabis producer in the world. They are based in Canada and I believe they will be the market leader in Europe, due to their infrastructure advantage through owning CC Pharma.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Vestas** **Wind** **Systems** **(VWDRY)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.40%**\n\ngain/loss: **197.44%** **gain**\n\nVestas is the global leader in wind turbine manufacturing and installation. They are one of the few pure wind plays in the stock market, making them an attractive choice for anybody looking to get exposure to wind. A big driver if future growth will be their service and maintainace business, which their management team has been focused on in recent quarters. This is a higher margin business with consistent recurring revenues. \n\n----------------------------\n\n**Facebook** **(FB)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.38%**\n\ngain/loss: **20.61%** **gain\n\nI\u2019m selling out of FB very soon but I still hold them for now. FB is an incredible business and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll see growth in the future, but it just isn\u2019t for me (anymore). I consider ethics a lot in my investments, which many of you may consider stupid but idc. \n\n---------------------------\n\n**Hannon** **Armstrong** **(HASI)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.18%**\n\ngain/loss: **57.40%** **gain**\n\nHASI is a REIT, which solely makes climate change related investments. They invest in the land under solar projects, energy efficient buildings and much more. HASI is a great dividend play and I expect their stock price to appreciate as climate change worries are exacerbated in the future. \n\n---------------------------\n\n**Beyond** **Meat** **(BYND)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.10%**\n\ngain/loss: **21.24%** **gain**\n\nI made a post with some DD earlier this year on Beyond so I\u2019ll just link that below:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/if9tmj/beyond_meat_bynd_fundamental_analysis_with_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n---------------------------\n\n**Brookefield** **Renewable** **Partners** **(BEPC)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.06%**\n\ngain/loss: **87.23%** **gain**\n\nBEPC owns and operates a portfolio of renewable energy assets. Earlier this year they completed a merger with Terraform Power, expanding their solar &amp; wind footprint. They are also the primer owner of hydroelectric power plants, which produce a consistent source of electricity. BEPC has a strong management team and owns valuable assets that will greatly appreciate in value as government incentives expand around renewable energy consumption. They also pay a nice dividend. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Disney** **(DIS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.03%**\n\ngain/loss: **50.06%** **gain** \n\nI\u2019m invested in Disney mostly for some portfolio diversity. I\u2019m a big fan of their streaming platform and business strategy revolving around that. This one isn\u2019t climate change related so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**First** **Solar** **(FSLR)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.84%**\n\ngain/loss: **70.47%** **gain**\n\nFirst Solar is an American based panel manufacturer and projects operator. They used differentiated technology with Cadmoum Telluride panels, which are supposed to increase output and lifetime at a higher cost. FSLR is just another play on the growing solar industry, and being U.S. based seems to reward them a higher earnings multiple in the market than their peers. They also have a beautiful balance sheet. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Trulieve** **Cannabis** **(TCNFF)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.44%**\n\ngain/loss: **5.33%** **gain**\n\nTrulieve is another Cannabis play. This one based in the U.S. with a large medical market in Florida. Nuff said. (Do your own research) \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**Star** **Peak** **Energy** **Transition** **(STPK)**\n\nportfolio weight **1.43%**\n\ngain/loss: **55.45%** **gain**\n\nStar peak is a brand new holding for me and already shot up like crazy. It\u2019s one of these merger companies (the word is censored on this subreddit). merging with Stem energy storage. Stem is involved in the battery storage industry, with mostly grid level storage systems. They currently have an even larger market share than Tesla and my reason for holding this stock is mostly as a hedge against Tesla\u2019s energy business. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Shopify** **(SHOP)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.10%**\n\ngain/loss: **18.19%** **gain**\n\nShopify is an eCommerce platform, which allows customers to seamlessly design their own website and process payments. I\u2019ve used Shopify in the past and am a big fan of the business, which is a big part of why I\u2019m invested. They have a steep valuation but I plan on holding for 10+ years. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTotal gain: **181.52%**\n\n(Note: I\u2019ve taken some profits on a few of my stocks so the unrealized gain from my current holdings is less than my \u201ctotal\u201d gain by a few % points.)\n\n--------------------------\n\nYes, I\u2019m young and idealistic and have a lot to learn but I do know a few things. Here\u2019s some of the lessons I\u2019ve learned along my 1 and a half year journey in the market. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n\nBy investing in a company, you are supporting them financially. Buying pressure on companies\u2019 stocks increases the price and allows them to raise capital more efficiently. It might be hard to hear, but **when** **you** **buy** **Exxon** **stock**, **you** **are** **helping** **them** **destroy** **our** **planet**. The same is true vice versa.  \n\n**Don\u2019t** **listen** to** **anybody** **on** **reddit**. Seriously. Nobody here knows any better than you. Do your own research, form your own judgements. If you\u2019re gonna pick individual stocks then following advice on reddit is not the way to go. Reading through investor relations pages is the best way to go. Watch videos and read articles about both sides of the story with different companies. Don\u2019t take these videos as facts though, just absorb what other people think and judge the validity of the information for yourself. It\u2019s important to **become** **an** **independent** **thinker**. This is a slow process but eventually you\u2019ll get the hang of things.\n\n**Invest** **with** **a** **10+** **year** **timeline**. This is especially true if you\u2019re young like myself. Don\u2019t concern yourself with daily or even monthly swings in a stock. Ask yourself if the company will be worth substantially more in a decade. If not, then say, if so then buy and hold. Don\u2019t try to time the market or swing trade. You\u2019re just bringing on unnecessary risk. Buy and hold and buy some more. \n\n**Assess** **your** **own** **risk** **tolerance**. As I\u2019m sure several people will point out, my portfolio is incredibly speculative and risky from a traditional viewpoint. I have a really fucking high risk tolerance, so I invest with a \u201criskier\u201d mindset. If I were to lose all my money tomorrow, I\u2019d be fine. I\u2019m going to have a college degree in a couple years and I\u2019m not worried about being able to find a job. My reason for investing is about having the financial freedom to do whatever I want in life, and not worry about money in the future. If you\u2019re investing for retirement or to pay off student loans, then I recommend taking a more conservative approach and maybe buying some index funds. However, if you\u2019re young and have a stomach for risk like myself, then go crazy.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nIn conclusion, I\u2019ve had an incredible year or so in the market. I don\u2019t expect to have even close to these same returns in the future, but I\u2019ve learned a thing or two and I\u2019m here to share this information. You may disagree with everything I said and all the stocks I own and that\u2019s okay!

Also, their use of AI makes the registration and claims process seamless and \u201cdelights\u201d customers. \n\n----------------------------\n\n**TPI** **Composites** **(TPIC)**\n\nportfolio weight: **3.73%**\n\ngain/loss: **153.99%** **gain**\n\nTPIC manufacturers wind blade composites. They supply the top five wind turbine companies outside of China. I wrote about them on prior posts so I\u2019ll just copy &amp; paste here:\n63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with Workhorse to manufacture vehicle parts for them.\n-----------------------------\n\n**Skyworks** **Solutions** **(SWKS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.83%**\n\ngain/loss: **60.57%** **gain**\n\nSkyworks is a semiconductor focused on connectivity chips for all kinds of devices. They aren\u2019t climate change related which is the point of this post so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Tattooed** **Chef** **(TTCF)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.65%**\n\ngain/loss: **55.90** **gain**\n\nTattooed Chef is a play on the rising plant-based food trend. They make a variety of frozen food items, widely available in Walmart, Costco and Target. They are expanding into Whole Foods, Trader Joe\u2019s and many more stores, where I expect them to be very successful. The plant based market is exploding for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there is more research on the health benefits of a plant based diet, with athletes such as Chris Paul &amp; Todd Gurley endorsing these brands. Also, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the threat of climate change and how avoiding red meat can have a positive impact on the planet. I expect TTCF to benefit off of these trends and continue innovating in the plant-based space. I bought in 3 weeks ago and the price has exploded since then. \n\n-------------------------\n\n**Workhorse** **(WKHS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.60%**\n\ngain/loss: **35.90%** **gain**\n\nWorkhorse is an electric delivery van company. They manufacture last mile electric vehicles and are developing drones to further decrease last mile delivery costs. They are a play on the e-commerce industry and electrification of vehicles. I\u2019m invested in them because last mile delivery is responsible for a large chunk of transportation carbon emissions and in desperate need of electrification. I also believe that Workhorse will get a large chunk of the upcoming USPS contract which will provide a stable revenue stream.\n---------------------\n\n**Aphria** **(APHA)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.45%**\n\ngain/loss: **53%** **gain**\n\nAphria is another MJ play for me. Once again they aren\u2019t a climate change investment so I\u2019ll keep it brief. They just finalized a merger with Tilray, making them the biggest cannabis producer in the world. They are based in Canada and I believe they will be the market leader in Europe, due to their infrastructure advantage through owning CC Pharma.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Vestas** **Wind** **Systems** **(VWDRY)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.40%**\n\ngain/loss: **197.44%** **gain**\n\nVestas is the global leader in wind turbine manufacturing and installation. They are one of the few pure wind plays in the stock market, making them an attractive choice for anybody looking to get exposure to wind. A big driver if future growth will be their service and maintainace business, which their management team has been focused on in recent quarters. This is a higher margin business with consistent recurring revenues. \n\n----------------------------\n\n**Facebook** **(FB)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.38%**\n\ngain/loss: **20.61%** **gain\n\nI\u2019m selling out of FB very soon but I still hold them for now. FB is an incredible business and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll see growth in the future, but it just isn\u2019t for me (anymore). I consider ethics a lot in my investments, which many of you may consider stupid but idc. \n\n---------------------------\n\n**Hannon** **Armstrong** **(HASI)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.18%**\n\ngain/loss: **57.40%** **gain**\n\nHASI is a REIT, which solely makes climate change related investments. They invest in the land under solar projects, energy efficient buildings and much more. HASI is a great dividend play and I expect their stock price to appreciate as climate change worries are exacerbated in the future. \n\n---------------------------\n\n**Beyond** **Meat** **(BYND)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.10%**\n\ngain/loss: **21.24%** **gain**\n\nI made a post with some DD earlier this year on Beyond so I\u2019ll just link that below:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/if9tmj/beyond_meat_bynd_fundamental_analysis_with_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n---------------------------\n\n**Brookefield** **Renewable** **Partners** **(BEPC)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.06%**\n\ngain/loss: **87.23%** **gain**\n\nBEPC owns and operates a portfolio of renewable energy assets. Earlier this year they completed a merger with Terraform Power, expanding their solar &amp; wind footprint. They are also the primer owner of hydroelectric power plants, which produce a consistent source of electricity. BEPC has a strong management team and owns valuable assets that will greatly appreciate in value as government incentives expand around renewable energy consumption. They also pay a nice dividend. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Disney** **(DIS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.03%**\n\ngain/loss: **50.06%** **gain** \n\nI\u2019m invested in Disney mostly for some portfolio diversity. I\u2019m a big fan of their streaming platform and business strategy revolving around that. This one isn\u2019t climate change related so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**First** **Solar** **(FSLR)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.84%**\n\ngain/loss: **70.47%** **gain**\n\nFirst Solar is an American based panel manufacturer and projects operator. They used differentiated technology with Cadmoum Telluride panels, which are supposed to increase output and lifetime at a higher cost. FSLR is just another play on the growing solar industry, and being U.S. based seems to reward them a higher earnings multiple in the market than their peers. They also have a beautiful balance sheet. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Trulieve** **Cannabis** **(TCNFF)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.44%**\n\ngain/loss: **5.33%** **gain**\n\nTrulieve is another Cannabis play. This one based in the U.S. with a large medical market in Florida. Nuff said.

It\u2019s one of these merger companies (the word is censored on this subreddit). merging with Stem energy storage. Stem is involved in the battery storage industry, with mostly grid level storage systems. They currently have an even larger market share than Tesla and my reason for holding this stock is mostly as a hedge against Tesla\u2019s energy business. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Shopify** **(SHOP)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.10%**\n\ngain/loss: **18.19%** **gain**\n\nShopify is an eCommerce platform, which allows customers to seamlessly design their own website and process payments. I\u2019ve used Shopify in the past and am a big fan of the business, which is a big part of why I\u2019m invested. They have a steep valuation but I plan on holding for 10+ years. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTotal gain: **181.52%**\n\n(Note: I\u2019ve taken some profits on a few of my stocks so the unrealized gain from my current holdings is less than my \u201ctotal\u201d gain by a few % points.)\n\n--------------------------\n\nYes, I\u2019m young and idealistic and have a lot to learn but I do know a few things. Here\u2019s some of the lessons I\u2019ve learned along my 1 and a half year journey in the market. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n\nBy investing in a company, you are supporting them financially. Buying pressure on companies\u2019 stocks increases the price and allows them to raise capital more efficiently. It might be hard to hear, but **when** **you** **buy** **Exxon** **stock**, **you** **are** **helping** **them** **destroy** **our** **planet**. The same is true vice versa.  \n\n**Don\u2019t** **listen** to** **anybody** **on** **reddit**. Seriously. Nobody here knows any better than you. Do your own research, form your own judgements. If you\u2019re gonna pick individual stocks then following advice on reddit is not the way to go. Reading through investor relations pages is the best way to go. Watch videos and read articles about both sides of the story with different companies. Don\u2019t take these videos as facts though, just absorb what other people think and judge the validity of the information for yourself. It\u2019s important to **become** **an** **independent** **thinker**. This is a slow process but eventually you\u2019ll get the hang of things.\n\n**Invest** **with** **a** **10+** **year** **timeline**. This is especially true if you\u2019re young like myself. Don\u2019t concern yourself with daily or even monthly swings in a stock. Ask yourself if the company will be worth substantially more in a decade. If not, then say, if so then buy and hold. Don\u2019t try to time the market or swing trade. You\u2019re just bringing on unnecessary risk. Buy and hold and buy some more. \n\n**Assess** **your** **own** **risk** **tolerance**. As I\u2019m sure several people will point out, my portfolio is incredibly speculative and risky from a traditional viewpoint. I have a really fucking high risk tolerance, so I invest with a \u201criskier\u201d mindset. If I were to lose all my money tomorrow, I\u2019d be fine. I\u2019m going to have a college degree in a couple years and I\u2019m not worried about being able to find a job. My reason for investing is about having the financial freedom to do whatever I want in life, and not worry about money in the future. If you\u2019re investing for retirement or to pay off student loans, then I recommend taking a more conservative approach and maybe buying some index funds. However, if you\u2019re young and have a stomach for risk like myself, then go crazy.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nIn conclusion, I\u2019ve had an incredible year or so in the market. I don\u2019t expect to have even close to these same returns in the future, but I\u2019ve learned a thing or two and I\u2019m here to share this information. You may disagree with everything I said and all the stocks I own and that\u2019s okay!

I am reposting it here to a bigger audience, with an added section to respond to some of the questions I received. I am hoping that by reposting on here, we can get more a discussion. I am not too familiar with reddit as I typically post on smaller value investing forums, and it is first time posting there. I plan to long in this company as I see the long term position of the company's growth in the health care sector. This is a minor position (5%) in what is a concentrated (10-15 company) portfolio.\n\n**PFMT- Performant Financial**  \n**Overview:**  \nPFMT is a technology-based provider of audit, recovery, payment accuracy, coordination of benefits (COB), and outsource services in the United States. PFMT analyze claims, identify, prevent and correct inaccurate payments. Using their proprietary analytics platform and industry expertise, PFMT aim to reduce losses on billions of dollars worth of improper healthcare payments, state/federal/and treasury tax delinquencies, defaulted student loans and other receivables. Primary customers include government commercial health plans, CMS, Blues plans, regional Insurers, private/commercial programs, etc that operate in complex and highly regulated environments that rely on PFMT's innovative and disruptive approach. Revenue is generated based on a percentage of validated recoveries for clients. Contracts are negotiated on case by case basis, fees may range from 10-30% of recoveries and the duration of contracts may last 3-5+ years. These are high margin, recurring revenue contracts, expected to provide multiple years of prolonged double digit growth.  \nThis is not a sexy business, quite boring in fact. However, a good investment should be boring. Hopefully you will also appreciate the new path management has coursed, and see the potential upside in this turnaround story.  \nHistorically, PFMT was known for its legacy business as a collection agency for student loans, federal/state tax delinquencies and other receivables. Since the taking over of student loan originations by the Federal government a decade ago, PFMTs student loan collections have seen a diminishing contribution to revenues over time. Currently, the student loans collection business accounts for about 22% of revenues. While \"Other\" legacy collections still account for about 26% of revenues. Growth in Other legacy collections has remained relatively flat over the years. A smaller business segment derives marginal revenues from first party call centers and licensing of hosted technology solutions to clients. ***The diamond in the rough refers to PFMT's up-and-coming*** ***healthcare*** ***business segment***, composed of claims auditing and eligibility reviews. After seeing losses in 2018/19 due to high ramp up costs and standard implementation time lags, this segment appears to be set for robust growth going forward. Management has been clear that from 2017-2019, adjusted EBITDA has witnessed a slowdown to reflect a period of transformation in the company to establish itself in the Healthcare space. Management has confidently reiterated their belief in successfully reaching a 2021 goal of achieving $200M revenue with 20% EBITDA margins, with double digit growth continuing for years to come.\n\n**Covid-19 Impact:**  \nThis year was shaping up to be a strong year for PFMT, as Q1 showed promising results that validated the new trajectory of the company. Unfortunately, Q2 and Q3 were impacted by the public health emergency related to Covid-19. The CARES act brought changes that affected the student loans collection segment. Student loan payments, interest accrual and involuntary collection of payments (wage garnishments) were originally suspended till September 30, 2020 but were extended till December 31, 2020. However, PFMT continued to generate student loan revenue for a number of months from existing in-process borrow rehabilitation agreements. Another impact of Covid came from existing healthcare audit customers that requested a short-term pause on PFMT activities. Mgmt has indicated these pauses have largely ended during the third quarter. To mitigate the impact of this temporary slowdown, mgmt had furloughed more than 500 employees which could result in savings of about $18 million. The company is now aggressively ramping up efforts (including hiring/recruiting). Mgmt anticipates the ramp up efforts to be properly reflected in revenue by Q1 of 2021.\n\n**Healthcare Business:**  \nThe healthcare platform has finally reached scale, accounting for the largest (and continually growing) contribution to PFMTs revenue. In Q3, the healthcare business generated $17.6M in revenue (48.5% of total revenues (refer to Figure 1 below to view a cut out from the latest 10-k)). That is a 20.5% increase on sequential basis and a 63% increase from the same period last year. Please refer to figure 2 below, to see the change in healthcare revenues over time. This segment will continue to grow as Mgmt has made it clear this will be a main focus for the company. Soon healthcare will be the primary source of revenue (50%++), leading to a market multiple re-rate.  \nHealthcare revenues over last 11 quarters:\n\nQ3 2020= $17.6M  \nQ2 2020= $14.6M  \nQ1 2020= $17.5M  \nQ4 2019=$14.3M  \nQ3 2019= $10.8M  \nQ2 2019= $9.3M  \nQ1 2019= $9M  \nQ4 2018= $9.9M  \nQ3 2018= $6.6M  \nQ2 2018= $6.1M  \nQ1 2018= $3.5M\n\n\\[Figure 1: Q3 Financial Highlight\\]([https://imgur.com/a/WlqPLjZ](https://imgur.com/a/WlqPLjZ))\n\n\\[Figure 2: PFMT Healthcare Revenues\\]([https://imgur.com/a/W1OtGXu](https://imgur.com/a/W1OtGXu))\n\n**Macro:**  \nThe macro environment indicates there should be tailwinds for the audit, recovery, payment accuracy and coordination of benefits outsourcing business solutions PFMT provides. According to the CMS, national healthcare expenditures are forecast to grow at 5.4% CAGR for the next 8 years. Reaching $6.8T by 2028. Despite efforts to reduce the amount of improper payments, error rates in the industry range from 6% in commercial to 14.9% in government plans. Healthcare spending growth is driven primarily by a combination of increasing enrollment and cost inflation. Given the current unemployment environment, we are witnessing a spike in Medicaid enrollment, which should continue to benefit the business via rising utilization and claims volumes. It is useful to note that there can be a lag of several months between Medicaid eligibility and resulting claims volumes. This indicates that a majority of the benefits from the current environment are still to come. Also, as private organizations and state governments are struggling with lower revenues and budget deficits, this could create an increased focus on cost containment strategies where PFMT could play a supporting function. PFMT mgmt sees a $200B+ healthcare TAM growing annually.  \n**Competitors:**  \nPFMT differentiates itself with its proprietary technology and customizable approach to each of their customers' needs. The space is mostly dominated by large, slow moving players, that lack flexibility and uniqueness in their approach. Major competitors include HMS Holdings Corp (HMSY-US, \\~\\~$3B mkt cap) and Cotiviti (acquired in mid-2018 for $4.9B). Contracts in this industry are limited, take time to implement and can last years. PFMT continues to build a moat around it's business by consistently winning, maintaining and being awarded new contracts. An example includes being re-awarded CMS recovery Audit Region 1 and being awarded the newly created Region 5. Thus, successfully showcasing PFMTs superior product and path to success in this space. PFMTs will continue to encroach on incumbents' healthcare market share as the market begins to realize the superiority of their technology and approach. Refer to Figure 3, below, for an image taken form the CMS website showing the audit region relative to competition. Figure 4 may help to visualize the healthcare insurance payment cycle, and where PFMT may offer value.  \n**Debt:**  \nOn Aug 2017, PFMT entered a credit agreement with an existing shareholder and customer, ECMC. As of September 30, 2020 PFMT has about $62M loan outstanding under this credit agreement. ECMC has been able to accumulate about 5.8M warrants in PFMT as part of the agreement (about 10% of outstanding shares) all at an average exercise price of $1.95. The effective interest rate was about 13.9% in the 1H 2020. The loan is classified as a current liability, with maturity in August 2021. However, PFMT has two one-year options to extend maturity.  \nPFMT currently (as of Sept 30,2020) has about $17.3M cash and equivalents on hand and is entering a period of FCF generation.  \nThe current low interest rate environment offers low hanging fruit for companies looking to refinance their loans at a lower rate. Reducing their loan rate to 5-8% could save up to $5.5M in annual interest expense.  \n**Timing/Technicals:**  \nAs the calendar approached their earnings announcement date (Nov 11), PFMT stock was trading around recent highs of $2. The stock started selling off aggressively into the earnings and significantly further following earnings (despite a very positive release). The selling pressure appears to have been caused by portfolio management layoffs at Invesco, a top holder. Public disclosure of these layoffs coincides with timing of initial selloff, and a recent 13G filing confirms the exited position. This should quell any fears holders and followers of this stock may have had, as the selling was not based on fundamental flaws in the company or a new short thesis. Invesco owned about 18% of PFMT. Following the recent pressure, it appears the stock is in extremely oversold territory. Since their exit, the average volume profile of the stock has improved significantly, making accumulating a position easier for both retail and institutional demand.  \n**Valuation:**  \nThe timing of Covid partially contributes to why the market overlooked this stock, as Q2 and Q3 earnings were impacted. To establish a fair EBITDA estimation for 2020, we will use Q1 results with a conservative bias. Q1 is most appropriate because it will give us the clearest picture of how the company was performing prior to the temporary impacts of Covid. Using Q1, EBITDA was $6.4M (after deducting stock compensation). Annualizing that amount will give us an EBITDA run rate of $25.6M. This is a conservative measure because we do not account for the impact of any potential interest rate savings or growth in the healthcare segment. Next we need to establish the enterprise value (EV= debt + mkt cap - cash). Which we use to calculate EV/EBITDA. Calculation below.  \nEBITDA= $25.6M  \nEnterprise Value (EV)= $62M (debt) + $41 (mkt cap) -$17.3M (Cash) = $85.7 M  \nEV/EBITDA= 3.3X  \nFully diluted share count of 59.7M o/s\n\nNow lets take a look at some Healthcare IT comparables. The first 7 are general comps, the bottom 3 are the most similar comps to PFMT. To clarify, HMSY is currently publicly trading and is a direct competitor to PFMT. In December 2019, HMSY acquired Accent (a coordination of benefits/payments accuracy unit of Intrado focused on commercial and Medicare Advantage payers) for $155M. Accent had generated about $50M of revenue during the 12 months ending october 2019 (vs PFMTs $150M revenues in 2019). Based on the transaction price, HMSY paid an estimated 11-12X EV/Ebitda on a TTM basis. COTV was acquired and taken private in 2018, it continues to be a direct competitor with PFMT. COTV operated in payment integrity and was acquired for $4.9B in mid 2018, an estimated EV/EBITDA multiple of 14-15X based on consensus 2019 estimates. Also, keep in mind that the average EV/EBITDA for S&amp;P companies in 2020 is about 14.5X.  \nHealthcare IT Peer Trading Comp Table  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Mkt Cap \u00a0SHARES O/S\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0EV\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0EV/EBITDA\n\nHMSY \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02,793 \u00a0 88.6M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3,021 16.8X  \nCHNG \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a05,581 304.5M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 10,237 11.2X  \nACN \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0173,423 661.1M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0171,554 19X  \nADS \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a03,466 \u00a0 49.6M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 24,047 30.3X  \nHQY \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5,013\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a077M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 5,803 27.2X  \nIQV \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a034,135\u00a0 191.7M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 45,733 19.5X  \nCERN \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a023,727 306.6M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 24,167 14X\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Average: 19.7X\n\nPFMT\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 40.5 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 59.7M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 86 3.3X  \n(fully diluted)\n\nMost Similar Comps:  \nCOTV\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4,900 (2019 est)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 14.5X  \nAccess\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0155 (Acquired by HMSY in 2019) 11-12X  \nHMSY \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02,793 88.6M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3,021 16.8X\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Average: 14.3X  \n\\[Table 2\\]([https://imgur.com/a/MP4yZgi](https://imgur.com/a/MP4yZgi))\n\nThe market still largely views PFMT as a declining student loans collections firm. Yet growing beneath the surface is an attractive healthcare business. As this segment continues to grow the market will recognize the high quality recurring revenue, ability to scale, and increasingly healthcare-focused pure-play as a catalyst for a multiple rerate. Now using the comps above, I will provide 3 scenarios (best, base, worst case scenario) applying a discount to conservatively account for the micro-cap nature and higher leverage of PFMT.  \nIn the best case scenario, we apply a 14X EV/EBTDA ratio (rounded down from the most similar comparable peer average of 14.3X) which, on a fully diluted share basis, lead to a current price per share of $6.  \nIn the base case scenario, we take a couple of notches off the closest peer average and apply a 12X EV/EBITDA ratio. Resulting in a current target price of $5.15/share  \nIn the worst case scenario, we further take off two more notches from the most similar peer average to apply a 10X EV/EBITDA ratio. Resulting in a price of $4.29/share.  \nAlso, considering the existing ownership of the company. Parthenon investors, Prescott Group, Mill Road Capital are all large shareholders. It is not unreasonable to think that they pursue a more aggressive activist role in the company and set it up for sale at a premium. It is also possible that competitors recognize the massive discount of this up-and-coming threat, and decide to acquire PFMT before other market participants drive up the price making such a strategic acquisition far more expensive. All of which offer upside to existing shareholders.  \nAs we approach future quarters and results continue to support this positive narrative we should start to see investor appetite pick up for this name. Average daily volumes have quadrupled since Invesco's recent exiting has added to the freely trading shares, improving the liquidity profile of PFMT. These signals will start appearing on investor screens as they (professional small cap investors, value investors, quant investors, generalists, hedge funds, etc) look for new ideas. There is virtually zero sell-side coverage of this stock at the moment, this will likely change in the future. **Accumulating a position now, presents an opportunity for entry at basement level prices in a stock that has the potential to provide 500-700% upside.**\n\n*Thank you for taking the time to read my idea.

This will be a short follow up summarizing the recent event and why I think it is important to the underlying thesis. Also, I will try to respond to the some of the questions received last night. Thank you to all who have engaged me. Hopefully we can continue this constructive dialogue around this investment idea. \n\nOn Monday morning (Dec 21), HMSY (a direct competitor of PFMT) announced it had agreed to be acquired by Gainwell Technologies for $3.4B. Gainwell is owned by the private equity firm Veritas Capital. In March 2020, DXC Technologies announced the sale of their Government Healthcare business segment for $5B in cash to Veritas which renamed this new segment: Gainwell Technologies. Prior to acquiring this segment from DXC, this healthcare business was generating $1.5B in annual revenues, growing double digits year over year with 20% margins (inline with industry standard and PFMTs 2021 margin goal). The transaction values HMSY at 16-17X forward 2021 EV/EBITDA.  From what I gather, this is above most consensus estimates but still seems to be a fair price. A reminder that Veritas also acquired Cotiviti (COTV) in 2018 at a slightly lower valuation of 14-16X EV/EBITDA. The willingness to pay a premium relative to their COTV recent transaction indicates growing opportunity in the space.\n\nVeritas intends on breaking up the various HMSY segments and redistributing them among its portfolio companies COTV and Gainwell. COTV will take on the payment integrity and population health management business while Gainwell will take on the Medicade, Coordination of benefits/third party liability services business. Strategically, Veritas is able to secure HMSY's valuable set of data assets in the Medicaid market, and gaining exposure to the potentially higher EBITDA in 2021 due to the positive recent Medicaid enrollment trend. However, HMSY has been under pressure for failing to deliver predictable results and underperformance in some segments (particularly their population health management business). This inherent volatility in the revenue model is a burden on these companies (including PFMT) as it masks longer term growth and margin expansion potential. \n\nThough FTC concerns don\u2019t appear to be an issue. It is uncertain to me what this new Veritas combination will mean for their Medicare RAC regions. As HMSY has one region and COTV has two. I believe there is a program limit of two regions per vendor. This could prove to be an obstacle for the new entity.  Also the inherent culture clash in executing large mergers typically leads to significant employee turnover and loss of talent. In such a niche industry, I would imagine the labor market is tight and any brain drain could hurt the new entity. In fact, a basic linkedin search of these companies indicates a recent influx of talent from large competitors into PFMT. If industry incumbents, particularly experienced sales people, are realizing PFMT has a superior platform relative to the large slow moving competition then this should be another positive signal reinforcing PFMTs trajectory. Discount this as anecdotal investigative evidence but I think it has merit.\n\nThe continuing theme of consolidation in this particular area of Healthcare IT highlights the large market opportunity across cost-containment and solutions services.\n\nRecent transactions:\n\nAccess acquired by HMSY in 2018 at 11-12X EV/EBITDA\n\nDXC HC segment acquired by Veritas/Gainwell \n\nCOTV acquired by Veritas at 14-15X\n\nHMSY acquired by Veritas at 16-17X\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis all bodes well for PFMT, as it solidifies my view that this turnaround story is not being valued as an appropriate comp to its peers. If TODAY the market determines that HMSY is worth 16-17X EV/EBITDA, this supports my Base and Best Case Scenario of valuing PFMT using a 12X ($5.15/share) and 14X ($6/share) multiple, respectively (accounting for microcap nature and leverage by reducing the multiple by a few notches).  The recent price improvement in PFMT appears to be driven by a recognition of PFMT being undervalued on a comparable basis. Volumes have improved in the last few sessions but the stock is still extremely undervalued. Likely some retail investors accumulating entry positions. Imagine if a small fund of $100 AUM identifies this stock as an ideal investment, decides to initiate a small 200 basis point position. It would require 2-3M shares. The stock was up 20% today after trading only 1M shares, accumulating supply for a single fund position will require a significant movement in price. Given the current valuation, this opportunity could soon hit the radar screens of multiple funds. The recent string of transactions will continue to attract attention to this space. Sooner or later someone will start kicking the tires on PFMT...\n\nResponses to recent questions and comments:\n\n 1. Is it possible that customers build/improve their internal tools to the point where they become threats to PFMT?\n\nGood question. Customers may marginally improve their ability to audit claims internally but not to the point of being a threat. It's important to understand that the solutions/services offered by PFMT, HMSY, COTV, etc require technology- heavy platforms that require significant amount of resources (financial and intellectual) to develop, once developed there are minimal incremental costs for higher volumes. These types of commitments are not usually within the realm of possibilities among the customer base.  The ever-changing complexity around these types of industries makes in-house billing departments ill-equipped to maximize value relative to specialists like PFMT. An example to illustrate such complexity would be the ongoing changes in the International Classification of Disease codes (ICD). When the WHO decided to change the medical classification codes of ICD9 to ICD10, it increased the number of procedure codes from 13,000 to 68,000. This is just one example of the type of nuance that will always provide opportunity for specialist support from a PFMT. \n\n2. Terms of the credit agreement and Why hasn\u2019t management refinanced the Debt?\n\nFor anyone eager to learn more about the terms of the Credit Agreement, i would advise you read the latest 10k (link posted in my original report). The 10-k is helpful in clearly outlining all details. \n\nI think management is working towards refinancing the debt. But these are not things that can be negotiated or arranged immediately. It is possible that management wants/needs to have a certain number of consistent quarter over quarter improvement before they can renegotiate terms. In the current interest rate environment and following their recent turnaround progress, this low hanging fruit should be picked soon enough. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.   Divesting legacy business?\n\nI would not be surprised to see parts of the legacy business sold off as the focus turns toward the growing health care business. I will continue monitoring management discussion on next earnings call for any evidence to support this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. PFMT is transitioning to focus on its healthcare business.\n\n Some commentators have referred to PFMT as a pure-play student loans collection firm which would be a false description. Student loans do not account for a majority of their revenues and management has made it clear their focus has changed towards a constantly growing healthcare industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. Comparables mentioned are 100X larger than PFMT, why is that a fair comparison?\n\nThis is a reasonable observation. The answer to which is a function of numerous factors. The current market cap is significantly depressed as the popularity contest that IS the stock market is not identifying the value of this name. The stock was depressed further as a large holder just sold their 18% position, pushing the price near all-time lows. The huge gap in public market valuation is one of the reasons why this is a table pounding buy in my opinion. As this gap closes the difference in market cap will seem more acceptable. \n\nAlso, despite being small, the fact that PFMT is able to compete on the same level with these giants is a testament to its superior product and team: evidenced by their ability to secure two Medicare RAC region contracts (competing directly with COTV and HMSY), among other contacts won from incumbents. \n\n6. What is the moat/\"secret sauce\"?\n\nI am not a software engineer, nor do I have inner workings into PFMT's technology. Based on publicly available information, I can speculate that PFMT's disruptive technology refers its ability to differentiate itself over the competition. Competitors have been using a \"one-size-fits-all approach\" to their customers. PFMT uses their proprietary software to scrape data and yield higher rates of potential recoverable claims. Their solutions are more client-centric than the competition. As a smaller player they can be nimble, providing customized solutions to fulfill each client\u2019s needs. For this reason they continue to be rewarded with new contracts taken from large incumbents. See the recent presentations (on their website) for quantitative case study examples.\n\nThese contracts are difficult to win, have long term time horizons.  The technology to service customers is unique and initially capital intensive to establish. Barriers to entry are significant.\n\n  \n**Sources:**  \n[https://www.performantcorp.com/investors/events-and-presentations/default.aspx](https://www.performantcorp.com/investors/events-and-presentations/default.aspx)  \n[https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=1550695&amp;owner=exclude](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=1550695&amp;owner=exclude)  \n[https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Monitoring-Programs/Medicare-FFS-Compliance-Programs/Recovery-Audit-Program](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Monitoring-Programs/Medicare-FFS-Compliance-Programs/Recovery-Audit-Program)  \n[https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical)", false, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 985586, "public", "self", "$PFMT Performant Financial: Boring Business but a Diamond in the Rough", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kiyfwx/pfmt_performant_financial_boring_business_but_a/", "all_ads", 6, 1608744694.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "EducationalOlive0", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5ncum280", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1608748294, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kiyfwx/pfmt_performant_financial_boring_business_but_a/", "gildings": {}, "id": "kiyfwx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 24, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/kiyfwx/pfmt_performant_financial_boring_business_but_a/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "KN_eOqEeipI6_qcQuig4n-Sq1MpJYYXxlqi9NDSn9Do", "resolutions": [{"height": 25, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CR1tMgcEGj5dM1We08jDPVqcCjpyz1dW-P51E8oDu4Y.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24a517bf8a387457f6921fd5ebdabd4f9a5c6708", "width": 108}, {"height": 51, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CR1tMgcEGj5dM1We08jDPVqcCjpyz1dW-P51E8oDu4Y.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adfdb10aad0fcb0d98af0d2f16f9f4635613a113", "width": 216}, {"height": 76, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CR1tMgcEGj5dM1We08jDPVqcCjpyz1dW-P51E8oDu4Y.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a71c48335df63c176dadd52f883e2504b70edfa6", "width": 320}, {"height": 152, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CR1tMgcEGj5dM1We08jDPVqcCjpyz1dW-P51E8oDu4Y.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31bf3a46091eeaaed0ac09a18a358382c1858641", "width": 640}, {"height": 229, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CR1tMgcEGj5dM1We08jDPVqcCjpyz1dW-P51E8oDu4Y.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf9eed7037c16d416d760d932313374b32b0fb33", "width": 960}, {"height": 258, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CR1tMgcEGj5dM1We08jDPVqcCjpyz1dW-P51E8oDu4Y.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abd9040a2fa07e07008457063be52b425a95aef8", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 361, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CR1tMgcEGj5dM1We08jDPVqcCjpyz1dW-P51E8oDu4Y.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5568fda33388504671590221b02b7265a3c7064f", "width": 1511}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1608748304, "score": 1, "selftext": "Disclaimer: I originally posted this in r/securityanalysis yesterday and received some responses. I am reposting it here to a bigger audience, with an added section to respond to some of the questions I received. I am hoping that by reposting on here, we can get more a discussion. I am not too familiar with reddit as I typically post on smaller value investing forums, and it is first time posting there. I plan to long in this company as I see the long term position of the company's growth in the health care sector. This is a minor position (5%) in what is a concentrated (10-15 company) portfolio.\n\n**PFMT- Performant Financial**  \n**Overview:**  \nPFMT is a technology-based provider of audit, recovery, payment accuracy, coordination of benefits (COB), and outsource services in the United States. PFMT analyze claims, identify, prevent and correct inaccurate payments. Using their proprietary analytics platform and industry expertise, PFMT aim to reduce losses on billions of dollars worth of improper healthcare payments, state/federal/and treasury tax delinquencies, defaulted student loans and other receivables. Primary customers include government commercial health plans, CMS, Blues plans, regional Insurers, private/commercial programs, etc that operate in complex and highly regulated environments that rely on PFMT's innovative and disruptive approach. Revenue is generated based on a percentage of validated recoveries for clients. Contracts are negotiated on case by case basis, fees may range from 10-30% of recoveries and the duration of contracts may last 3-5+ years. These are high margin, recurring revenue contracts, expected to provide multiple years of prolonged double digit growth.  \nThis is not a sexy business, quite boring in fact. However, a good investment should be boring. Hopefully you will also appreciate the new path management has coursed, and see the potential upside in this turnaround story.  \nHistorically, PFMT was known for its legacy business as a collection agency for student loans, federal/state tax delinquencies and other receivables. Since the taking over of student loan originations by the Federal government a decade ago, PFMTs student loan collections have seen a diminishing contribution to revenues over time. Currently, the student loans collection business accounts for about 22% of revenues. While \"Other\" legacy collections still account for about 26% of revenues. Growth in Other legacy collections has remained relatively flat over the years. A smaller business segment derives marginal revenues from first party call centers and licensing of hosted technology solutions to clients. ***The diamond in the rough refers to PFMT's up-and-coming*** ***healthcare*** ***business segment***, composed of claims auditing and eligibility reviews. After seeing losses in 2018/19 due to high ramp up costs and standard implementation time lags, this segment appears to be set for robust growth going forward. Management has been clear that from 2017-2019, adjusted EBITDA has witnessed a slowdown to reflect a period of transformation in the company to establish itself in the Healthcare space. Management has confidently reiterated their belief in successfully reaching a 2021 goal of achieving $200M revenue with 20% EBITDA margins, with double digit growth continuing for years to come.\n\n**Covid-19 Impact:**  \nThis year was shaping up to be a strong year for PFMT, as Q1 showed promising results that validated the new trajectory of the company. Unfortunately, Q2 and Q3 were impacted by the public health emergency related to Covid-19. The CARES act brought changes that affected the student loans collection segment. Student loan payments, interest accrual and involuntary collection of payments (wage garnishments) were originally suspended till September 30, 2020 but were extended till December 31, 2020. However, PFMT continued to generate student loan revenue for a number of months from existing in-process borrow rehabilitation agreements. Another impact of Covid came from existing healthcare audit customers that requested a short-term pause on PFMT activities. Mgmt has indicated these pauses have largely ended during the third quarter. To mitigate the impact of this temporary slowdown, mgmt had furloughed more than 500 employees which could result in savings of about $18 million. The company is now aggressively ramping up efforts (including hiring/recruiting). Mgmt anticipates the ramp up efforts to be properly reflected in revenue by Q1 of 2021.\n\n**Healthcare Business:**  \nThe healthcare platform has finally reached scale, accounting for the largest (and continually growing) contribution to PFMTs revenue. In Q3, the healthcare business generated $17.6M in revenue (48.5% of total revenues (refer to Figure 1 below to view a cut out from the latest 10-k)). That is a 20.5% increase on sequential basis and a 63% increase from the same period last year. Please refer to figure 2 below, to see the change in healthcare revenues over time. This segment will continue to grow as Mgmt has made it clear this will be a main focus for the company. Soon healthcare will be the primary source of revenue (50%++), leading to a market multiple re-rate.  \nHealthcare revenues over last 11 quarters:\n\nQ3 2020= $17.6M  \nQ2 2020= $14.6M  \nQ1 2020= $17.5M  \nQ4 2019=$14.3M  \nQ3 2019= $10.8M  \nQ2 2019= $9.3M  \nQ1 2019= $9M  \nQ4 2018= $9.9M  \nQ3 2018= $6.6M  \nQ2 2018= $6.1M  \nQ1 2018= $3.5M\n\n\\[Figure 1: Q3 Financial Highlight\\]([https://imgur.com/a/WlqPLjZ](https://imgur.com/a/WlqPLjZ))\n\n\\[Figure 2: PFMT Healthcare Revenues\\]([https://imgur.com/a/W1OtGXu](https://imgur.com/a/W1OtGXu))\n\n**Macro:**  \nThe macro environment indicates there should be tailwinds for the audit, recovery, payment accuracy and coordination of benefits outsourcing business solutions PFMT provides. According to the CMS, national healthcare expenditures are forecast to grow at 5.4% CAGR for the next 8 years. Reaching $6.8T by 2028. Despite efforts to reduce the amount of improper payments, error rates in the industry range from 6% in commercial to 14.9% in government plans. Healthcare spending growth is driven primarily by a combination of increasing enrollment and cost inflation. Given the current unemployment environment, we are witnessing a spike in Medicaid enrollment, which should continue to benefit the business via rising utilization and claims volumes. It is useful to note that there can be a lag of several months between Medicaid eligibility and resulting claims volumes. This indicates that a majority of the benefits from the current environment are still to come. Also, as private organizations and state governments are struggling with lower revenues and budget deficits, this could create an increased focus on cost containment strategies where PFMT could play a supporting function. PFMT mgmt sees a $200B+ healthcare TAM growing annually.  \n**Competitors:**  \nPFMT differentiates itself with its proprietary technology and customizable approach to each of their customers' needs. The space is mostly dominated by large, slow moving players, that lack flexibility and uniqueness in their approach. Major competitors include HMS Holdings Corp (HMSY-US, \\~\\~$3B mkt cap) and Cotiviti (acquired in mid-2018 for $4.9B). Contracts in this industry are limited, take time to implement and can last years. PFMT continues to build a moat around it's business by consistently winning, maintaining and being awarded new contracts. An example includes being re-awarded CMS recovery Audit Region 1 and being awarded the newly created Region 5. Thus, successfully showcasing PFMTs superior product and path to success in this space. PFMTs will continue to encroach on incumbents' healthcare market share as the market begins to realize the superiority of their technology and approach. Refer to Figure 3, below, for an image taken form the CMS website showing the audit region relative to competition. Figure 4 may help to visualize the healthcare insurance payment cycle, and where PFMT may offer value.  \n**Debt:**  \nOn Aug 2017, PFMT entered a credit agreement with an existing shareholder and customer, ECMC. As of September 30, 2020 PFMT has about $62M loan outstanding under this credit agreement. ECMC has been able to accumulate about 5.8M warrants in PFMT as part of the agreement (about 10% of outstanding shares) all at an average exercise price of $1.95. The effective interest rate was about 13.9% in the 1H 2020. The loan is classified as a current liability, with maturity in August 2021. However, PFMT has two one-year options to extend maturity.  \nPFMT currently (as of Sept 30,2020) has about $17.3M cash and equivalents on hand and is entering a period of FCF generation.  \nThe current low interest rate environment offers low hanging fruit for companies looking to refinance their loans at a lower rate. Reducing their loan rate to 5-8% could save up to $5.5M in annual interest expense.  \n**Timing/Technicals:**  \nAs the calendar approached their earnings announcement date (Nov 11), PFMT stock was trading around recent highs of $2. The stock started selling off aggressively into the earnings and significantly further following earnings (despite a very positive release). The selling pressure appears to have been caused by portfolio management layoffs at Invesco, a top holder. Public disclosure of these layoffs coincides with timing of initial selloff, and a recent 13G filing confirms the exited position. This should quell any fears holders and followers of this stock may have had, as the selling was not based on fundamental flaws in the company or a new short thesis. Invesco owned about 18% of PFMT. Following the recent pressure, it appears the stock is in extremely oversold territory. Since their exit, the average volume profile of the stock has improved significantly, making accumulating a position easier for both retail and institutional demand.  \n**Valuation:**  \nThe timing of Covid partially contributes to why the market overlooked this stock, as Q2 and Q3 earnings were impacted. To establish a fair EBITDA estimation for 2020, we will use Q1 results with a conservative bias. Q1 is most appropriate because it will give us the clearest picture of how the company was performing prior to the temporary impacts of Covid. Using Q1, EBITDA was $6.4M (after deducting stock compensation). Annualizing that amount will give us an EBITDA run rate of $25.6M. This is a conservative measure because we do not account for the impact of any potential interest rate savings or growth in the healthcare segment. Next we need to establish the enterprise value (EV= debt + mkt cap - cash). Which we use to calculate EV/EBITDA. Calculation below.  \nEBITDA= $25.6M  \nEnterprise Value (EV)= $62M (debt) + $41 (mkt cap) -$17.3M (Cash) = $85.7 M  \nEV/EBITDA= 3.3X  \nFully diluted share count of 59.7M o/s\n\nNow lets take a look at some Healthcare IT comparables. The first 7 are general comps, the bottom 3 are the most similar comps to PFMT. To clarify, HMSY is currently publicly trading and is a direct competitor to PFMT. In December 2019, HMSY acquired Accent (a coordination of benefits/payments accuracy unit of Intrado focused on commercial and Medicare Advantage payers) for $155M. Accent had generated about $50M of revenue during the 12 months ending october 2019 (vs PFMTs $150M revenues in 2019). Based on the transaction price, HMSY paid an estimated 11-12X EV/Ebitda on a TTM basis. COTV was acquired and taken private in 2018, it continues to be a direct competitor with PFMT. COTV operated in payment integrity and was acquired for $4.9B in mid 2018, an estimated EV/EBITDA multiple of 14-15X based on consensus 2019 estimates. Also, keep in mind that the average EV/EBITDA for S&amp;P companies in 2020 is about 14.5X.  \nHealthcare IT Peer Trading Comp Table  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Mkt Cap \u00a0SHARES O/S\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0EV\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0EV/EBITDA\n\nHMSY \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02,793 \u00a0 88.6M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3,021 16.8X  \nCHNG \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a05,581 304.5M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 10,237 11.2X  \nACN \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0173,423 661.1M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0171,554 19X  \nADS \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a03,466 \u00a0 49.6M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 24,047 30.3X  \nHQY \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5,013\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a077M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 5,803 27.2X  \nIQV \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a034,135\u00a0 191.7M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 45,733 19.5X  \nCERN \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a023,727 306.6M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 24,167 14X\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Average: 19.7X\n\nPFMT\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 40.5 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 59.7M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 86 3.3X  \n(fully diluted)\n\nMost Similar Comps:  \nCOTV\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4,900 (2019 est)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 14.5X  \nAccess\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0155 (Acquired by HMSY in 2019) 11-12X  \nHMSY \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02,793 88.6M \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3,021 16.8X\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Average: 14.3X  \n\\[Table 2\\]([https://imgur.com/a/MP4yZgi](https://imgur.com/a/MP4yZgi))\n\nThe market still largely views PFMT as a declining student loans collections firm. Yet growing beneath the surface is an attractive healthcare business. As this segment continues to grow the market will recognize the high quality recurring revenue, ability to scale, and increasingly healthcare-focused pure-play as a catalyst for a multiple rerate. Now using the comps above, I will provide 3 scenarios (best, base, worst case scenario) applying a discount to conservatively account for the micro-cap nature and higher leverage of PFMT.  \nIn the best case scenario, we apply a 14X EV/EBTDA ratio (rounded down from the most similar comparable peer average of 14.3X) which, on a fully diluted share basis, lead to a current price per share of $6.  \nIn the base case scenario, we take a couple of notches off the closest peer average and apply a 12X EV/EBITDA ratio. Resulting in a current target price of $5.15/share  \nIn the worst case scenario, we further take off two more notches from the most similar peer average to apply a 10X EV/EBITDA ratio. Resulting in a price of $4.29/share.  \nAlso, considering the existing ownership of the company. Parthenon investors, Prescott Group, Mill Road Capital are all large shareholders. It is not unreasonable to think that they pursue a more aggressive activist role in the company and set it up for sale at a premium. It is also possible that competitors recognize the massive discount of this up-and-coming threat, and decide to acquire PFMT before other market participants drive up the price making such a strategic acquisition far more expensive. All of which offer upside to existing shareholders.  \nAs we approach future quarters and results continue to support this positive narrative we should start to see investor appetite pick up for this name. Average daily volumes have quadrupled since Invesco's recent exiting has added to the freely trading shares, improving the liquidity profile of PFMT. These signals will start appearing on investor screens as they (professional small cap investors, value investors, quant investors, generalists, hedge funds, etc) look for new ideas. There is virtually zero sell-side coverage of this stock at the moment, this will likely change in the future. **Accumulating a position now, presents an opportunity for entry at basement level prices in a stock that has the potential to provide 500-700% upside.**\n\n*Thank you for taking the time to read my idea.

This will be a short follow up summarizing the recent event and why I think it is important to the underlying thesis. Also, I will try to respond to the some of the questions received last night. Thank you to all who have engaged me. Hopefully we can continue this constructive dialogue around this investment idea. \n\nOn Monday morning (Dec 21), HMSY (a direct competitor of PFMT) announced it had agreed to be acquired by Gainwell Technologies for $3.4B. Gainwell is owned by the private equity firm Veritas Capital. In March 2020, DXC Technologies announced the sale of their Government Healthcare business segment for $5B in cash to Veritas which renamed this new segment: Gainwell Technologies. Prior to acquiring this segment from DXC, this healthcare business was generating $1.5B in annual revenues, growing double digits year over year with 20% margins (inline with industry standard and PFMTs 2021 margin goal). The transaction values HMSY at 16-17X forward 2021 EV/EBITDA.  From what I gather, this is above most consensus estimates but still seems to be a fair price. A reminder that Veritas also acquired Cotiviti (COTV) in 2018 at a slightly lower valuation of 14-16X EV/EBITDA. The willingness to pay a premium relative to their COTV recent transaction indicates growing opportunity in the space.\n\nVeritas intends on breaking up the various HMSY segments and redistributing them among its portfolio companies COTV and Gainwell. COTV will take on the payment integrity and population health management business while Gainwell will take on the Medicade, Coordination of benefits/third party liability services business. Strategically, Veritas is able to secure HMSY's valuable set of data assets in the Medicaid market, and gaining exposure to the potentially higher EBITDA in 2021 due to the positive recent Medicaid enrollment trend. However, HMSY has been under pressure for failing to deliver predictable results and underperformance in some segments (particularly their population health management business). This inherent volatility in the revenue model is a burden on these companies (including PFMT) as it masks longer term growth and margin expansion potential. \n\nThough FTC concerns don\u2019t appear to be an issue. It is uncertain to me what this new Veritas combination will mean for their Medicare RAC regions. As HMSY has one region and COTV has two. I believe there is a program limit of two regions per vendor. This could prove to be an obstacle for the new entity.  Also the inherent culture clash in executing large mergers typically leads to significant employee turnover and loss of talent. In such a niche industry, I would imagine the labor market is tight and any brain drain could hurt the new entity. In fact, a basic linkedin search of these companies indicates a recent influx of talent from large competitors into PFMT. If industry incumbents, particularly experienced sales people, are realizing PFMT has a superior platform relative to the large slow moving competition then this should be another positive signal reinforcing PFMTs trajectory. Discount this as anecdotal investigative evidence but I think it has merit.\n\nThe continuing theme of consolidation in this particular area of Healthcare IT highlights the large market opportunity across cost-containment and solutions services.\n\nRecent transactions:\n\nAccess acquired by HMSY in 2018 at 11-12X EV/EBITDA\n\nDXC HC segment acquired by Veritas/Gainwell \n\nCOTV acquired by Veritas at 14-15X\n\nHMSY acquired by Veritas at 16-17X\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis all bodes well for PFMT, as it solidifies my view that this turnaround story is not being valued as an appropriate comp to its peers. If TODAY the market determines that HMSY is worth 16-17X EV/EBITDA, this supports my Base and Best Case Scenario of valuing PFMT using a 12X ($5.15/share) and 14X ($6/share) multiple, respectively (accounting for microcap nature and leverage by reducing the multiple by a few notches).  The recent price improvement in PFMT appears to be driven by a recognition of PFMT being undervalued on a comparable basis. Volumes have improved in the last few sessions but the stock is still extremely undervalued. Likely some retail investors accumulating entry positions. Imagine if a small fund of $100 AUM identifies this stock as an ideal investment, decides to initiate a small 200 basis point position. It would require 2-3M shares. The stock was up 20% today after trading only 1M shares, accumulating supply for a single fund position will require a significant movement in price. Given the current valuation, this opportunity could soon hit the radar screens of multiple funds. The recent string of transactions will continue to attract attention to this space. Sooner or later someone will start kicking the tires on PFMT...\n\nResponses to recent questions and comments:\n\n 1. Is it possible that customers build/improve their internal tools to the point where they become threats to PFMT?\n\nGood question. Customers may marginally improve their ability to audit claims internally but not to the point of being a threat. It's important to understand that the solutions/services offered by PFMT, HMSY, COTV, etc require technology- heavy platforms that require significant amount of resources (financial and intellectual) to develop, once developed there are minimal incremental costs for higher volumes. These types of commitments are not usually within the realm of possibilities among the customer base.  The ever-changing complexity around these types of industries makes in-house billing departments ill-equipped to maximize value relative to specialists like PFMT. An example to illustrate such complexity would be the ongoing changes in the International Classification of Disease codes (ICD). When the WHO decided to change the medical classification codes of ICD9 to ICD10, it increased the number of procedure codes from 13,000 to 68,000. This is just one example of the type of nuance that will always provide opportunity for specialist support from a PFMT. \n\n2. Terms of the credit agreement and Why hasn\u2019t management refinanced the Debt?\n\nFor anyone eager to learn more about the terms of the Credit Agreement, i would advise you read the latest 10k (link posted in my original report). The 10-k is helpful in clearly outlining all details. \n\nI think management is working towards refinancing the debt. But these are not things that can be negotiated or arranged immediately. It is possible that management wants/needs to have a certain number of consistent quarter over quarter improvement before they can renegotiate terms. In the current interest rate environment and following their recent turnaround progress, this low hanging fruit should be picked soon enough. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.   Divesting legacy business?\n\nI would not be surprised to see parts of the legacy business sold off as the focus turns toward the growing health care business. I will continue monitoring management discussion on next earnings call for any evidence to support this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. PFMT is transitioning to focus on its healthcare business.\n\n Some commentators have referred to PFMT as a pure-play student loans collection firm which would be a false description. Student loans do not account for a majority of their revenues and management has made it clear their focus has changed towards a constantly growing healthcare industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. Comparables mentioned are 100X larger than PFMT, why is that a fair comparison?\n\nThis is a reasonable observation. The answer to which is a function of numerous factors. The current market cap is significantly depressed as the popularity contest that IS the stock market is not identifying the value of this name. The stock was depressed further as a large holder just sold their 18% position, pushing the price near all-time lows. The huge gap in public market valuation is one of the reasons why this is a table pounding buy in my opinion. As this gap closes the difference in market cap will seem more acceptable. \n\nAlso, despite being small, the fact that PFMT is able to compete on the same level with these giants is a testament to its superior product and team: evidenced by their ability to secure two Medicare RAC region contracts (competing directly with COTV and HMSY), among other contacts won from incumbents. \n\n6. What is the moat/\"secret sauce\"?\n\nI am not a software engineer, nor do I have inner workings into PFMT's technology. Based on publicly available information, I can speculate that PFMT's disruptive technology refers its ability to differentiate itself over the competition. Competitors have been using a \"one-size-fits-all approach\" to their customers. PFMT uses their proprietary software to scrape data and yield higher rates of potential recoverable claims. Their solutions are more client-centric than the competition. As a smaller player they can be nimble, providing customized solutions to fulfill each client\u2019s needs. For this reason they continue to be rewarded with new contracts taken from large incumbents. See the recent presentations (on their website) for quantitative case study examples.\n\nThese contracts are difficult to win, have long term time horizons.  The technology to service customers is unique and initially capital intensive to establish. Barriers to entry are significant.\n\n  \n**Sources:**  \n[https://www.performantcorp.com/investors/events-and-presentations/default.aspx](https://www.performantcorp.com/investors/events-and-presentations/default.aspx)  \n[https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=1550695&amp;owner=exclude](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=1550695&amp;owner=exclude)  \n[https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Monitoring-Programs/Medicare-FFS-Compliance-Programs/Recovery-Audit-Program](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Monitoring-Programs/Medicare-FFS-Compliance-Programs/Recovery-Audit-Program)  \n[https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical)", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 985586, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "$PFMT Performant Financial: Boring Business but a Diamond in the Rough", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kiyfwx/pfmt_performant_financial_boring_business_but_a/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1608744694.0}], [[], false, "uworich", null, [], null, "text", "t2_382zazj", false, false, [], false, false, 1608699697, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kimlqz/shift_technologies_sft/", {}, "kimlqz", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "tickerdiscussion", [], "612ee368-65e6-11e5-b53f-129e4297eb59", "Ticker Discussion", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 8, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/kimlqz/shift_technologies_sft/", false, 6, 1608699708, 1, "If you like carvana, you\u2019ll love shift.

New CEO is a Winklevoss 2.0 and the other brother is VP of marketing at AbbVie. Executives, management team, and medical advisory team all have strong ties to helping coolsculpting get bought out by Allergan for $2.48 billion.\n\nSoliton is a company that develops, produces, markets, and sells a medical device that uses rapid acoustic pulse technology to provide minimally invasive (and non-invasive) treatment for several aesthetics treatments and enhancements. Pretty much they have invented a device that removes tattoos in 3 visits, reduces the appearance of cellulite, and can remove the appears of scars. Their business model is based on the \u201crazor and blade\u201d strategy where they sell the device then profit from each cartridge used in the treatments.\n\n1) Invented by Christopher Capelli, an MIT engineer and medical doctor, who led the office of technology-based ventures at the university of Texas before leaving to co-found Soliton.\n\na. Significant because this man\u2019s job was literally to review medical device technology. He must have seen hundreds or thousands of different devices in his time there and has seen which one\u2019s workout and which don\u2019t. Upon coming across this device (which maybe he made, maybe a student made, maybe it was a combination of both) he ups and quits his job because THIS IS IT! The one that will make him a billionaire\n\n2) The Science Advisory Board for Soliton has 9 people who are members of the Zeltiq/Coolsculpting/Abbvie Medical Advisory team. Ironically enough, this device directly compliments the CoolSculpting treatments and the aesthetics portfolio that Abbvie is building out.\n\na. Significant because CoolSculpting has been growing and become more and more readily available and once Soliton\u2019s RAP devices launches it will be directly integrated into each office.\n\n3) The Winklevoss twins 2.0 are Brent and Brad Hauser. They both attended Standford where they were track stars they eventually made their way into medical device industry. Following a similar path they were both involved at the executive level in Zeltiq (ie. Coolsculpting) before the buyout and then were executives for Allergan (Allergan bought Zeltiq, then allergan was bought by Abbvie) and eventually Abbvie. Although working in different capacities they were closely tied in working on the projects/business.\n\na. Significant because what has happened is Abbvie seem to already be planting their people at Soliton to guide it in the right direction and ensure its success before they decide to add it to their portfolio. They told Brad, who was on the board of directors for Soliton while working at Abbvie, to take the CEO position so they have more control. Meanwhile \u2018ol Brent is still at Abbvie, probably talking over thanksgiving dinner about all the money they will make when the buyout happens in a few years.\n\n4) FDA approval has already been granted for the purpose of removing tattoos. Tattoos can now be removed in 3 visits vs what would normally take 8-10 visits. Soliton has hired our marketing team and distribution partners for their launch in Q2 2021. FDA approval for purposes of cellulite treatment should take place in the next 1-3 months. \n\na. Significant because they have a real product with real results that adds real value to the market and by this time next year they will be rolling in revenue. FDA approval for the device has already been granted so the approval for cellulite treatment is damn near guaranteed. Then\u2026 it is on to the FDA approval for keloid and hypertrophic scar reduction which is supposedly a bigger market than tattoo removal and cellulite reduction combined.\n\n5) Lack of options and small number of shares outstanding has caused institutions to overlook the company for now. This will probably change once volume picks up, revenues start showing next year, and cellulite FDA approval is finalized.\n\nWhy would Abbive just buy them now? Well, it\u2019s a pain the a$$ to buy a company, especially one that hasn\u2019t sold anything yet. I think they want to just leave the heavy lifting and regulatory crap to Soliton but once the FDA approvals go through, sales start happening, and they get concrete proof of the market potential, then they will step in.

The U.S. market is estimated to be \\~$37.8bn and steadily growing. This is the second-largest category in the broader $279bn QSR market. The QSR pizza industry is primarily comprised of delivery, dine-in, and carryout. Unsurprisingly carryout and delivery are the two largest segments.\n\nDomino\u2019s is the leading market share leader for U.S. pizza delivery and the second-largest market share for carryout. The four industry leaders, Pizza Hut, Papa John\u2019s Pizza, Domino\u2019s, and Little Caesars Pizza account for 61% of the U.S. pizza delivery market and 51% of the carryout market.\n\nThe international pizza market is more underdeveloped than the United States. Domino\u2019s is one of three companies with a global presence.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nDomino\u2019s was founded in 1960 by two brothers. The two brothers initially focused on opening stores near college campuses and military bases. Fast forward almost three decades and Bain Capital buys 93% of the business in 1998. A few years later, Bain proceeds to IPO Domino\u2019s in 2004, and it\u2019s been a public company ever since.\n\nDomino\u2019s has three different revenue segments:\n\n* U.S. Stores\n* International Franchises\n* Supply Chain\n\nWe\u2019ll dig into these different business lines and how they all work.\n\n**U.S. Stores**\n\nU.S. stores consist of both company-owned stores and franchised stores. Roughly 6% of all U.S. stores are company-owned. These stores are typically used for testing sites for new innovation as well as training and developing future talent.\n\nThere are more than 6,100 U.S. stores, with \\~340 stores being company-owned and \\~5,800 being franchisees. The \\~5,800 franchised stores are operated by 777 U.S. franchisees. These franchisees are able to benefit from Domino\u2019s brand image with a low capital investment. The largest U.S franchisee operates more than 176 locations.\n\nDomino\u2019s has a rigorous process for U.S. franchisees. Those interested in being a franchisee must manage a store for at least a year and graduate from its franchise management school program. This is successful as there is a 99% franchise agreement renewal rate. Franchisees must pay a 5.5% royalty fee on sales and certain technology fees.\n\nStores must also contribute 6% of sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns. These contributions go into Domino\u2019s National Advertising Fund, which is a not-for-profit advertising subsidiary of Domino\u2019s.\n\n**International Franchises**\n\nDomino\u2019s has more than 10,894 international franchises in more than 90 markets. The main source of revenue from these stores is royalty payments. Domino\u2019s top ten international markets account for 63% of international stores.\n\nDomino\u2019s grants franchisees exclusive rights to develop and sub-franchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in particular geographic regions. This means they can create their own Domino\u2019s in international markets. They control the franchisee options, the supply chain centers, and other decisions. These franchisees pay an initial one-time franchise fee and a fee upon the opening of each additional store. The master franchisee pays a continuous 3.0% royalty fee on sales,\n\n**Supply Chain**\n\nDomino\u2019s operates 19 dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers, 1 thin crust manufacturing center, 1 vegetable processing center, and 1 center providing equipment and supplies to U.S. and some international stores. The management team is continuously looking to expand and build more centers.\n\nDomino\u2019s sells food and supplies to more than 6,600 stores. Domino\u2019s believes that franchisees buy directly from them due to cost savings, efficiencies, quality offerings, and consistency. Franchisees also benefit from profit-sharing arrangements with supply chain centers. This program offers participating franchisees 50% of its regional supply chain center\u2019s pre-tax profits.\n\n**Total Addressable Market**\n\nThe global QSR pizza market is already well established with the biggest opportunity being in expanding in international markets and same-store sales growth in more established markets such as the U.S. One of my main concerns is just how big the pizza market can be. I feel as though the pizza market is already well-established, but Domino\u2019s talks about their fortressing strategy which is adding more Domino\u2019s stores within one area to improve on delivery times, customer service, and cost efficiencies (cheaper to deliver pizza the closer the customer), and other important areas.\n\n**Competitive Advantages**\n\n1. **Brand.** Domino\u2019s is one of the strongest brands in the world. They benefit from brand recognition almost anywhere you go in the United States and I\u2019d bet it\u2019d be similar in some foreign countries. There are definitely some die-hard Domino\u2019s fans and then there\u2019s also your local pizza restaurants that arguably have better pizza than Domino\u2019s but these companies can\u2019t compete on price. Basically, when ordering from Domino\u2019s you know what you\u2019re getting.\n2. **Scale.** Since Domino\u2019s is the largest pizza company, it\u2019s able to benefit from economies of scale through purchasing power over suppliers, can test changes on a small scale, and then roll these features out globally. Scale also gives Domino\u2019s the benefit of operating leverage. As the international franchise store count grows, Domino\u2019s will collect royalty fees that do not require extensive operating margins so operating margins grow slower than international royalty fees giving Domino\u2019s operating leverage for this segment of the business. The same can be said for US stores that are not company-owned.\n\n**Financials**\n\nDomino\u2019s breaks down revenue into U.S. stores which include company-owned stores, franchise stores, U.S. franchise advertising, then supply chain, and international franchise royalties and fees. Other important financial numbers are global retail sales growth, same-store sales growth, and total store count. These numbers are all listed below.\n\n**2019:**\n\n* Total revenue = \\~$3.6bn\n* U.S. Store revenue = \\~$1.3bn\n* Supply chain = \\~$2.1bn\n* International franchise royalties and fees = $0.2bn\n* EBIT (Operating income) = \\~$0.6bn\n* EBIT margin = 16.6%\n* Global retail sales growth = 8.0%\n* Total store count = 17,020\n* U.S. stores = 6,126\n* International stores = 10,894\n\n**2018:**\n\n* Total revenue = \\~$3.4bn\n* U.S. Store revenue = \\~$1.3bn\n* Supply chain = \\~$2.0bn\n* International franchise royalties and fees = $0.2bn\n* EBIT (Operating income) = \\~$0.6bn\n* EBIT margin = 16.6%\n* Global retail sales growth = 10.8%\n* Total store count = 15,914\n* U.S. stores = 5,876\n* International stores = 10,038\n\n**2017:**\n\n* Total revenue = \\~$2.7bn\n* U.S. Store revenue = \\~$0.8bn (but did not include advertising revenue)\n* Supply chain = \\~$1.7bn\n* International franchise royalties and fees = $0.2bn\n* EBIT (Operating income) = \\~$0.5bn\n* EBIT margin = 16.6%\n* Global retail sales growth = 13.0%\n* Total store count = 14,856\n* U.S. stores = 5,587\n* International stores = 9,269\n\n**What\u2019s Interesting**\n\nDomino\u2019s has outperformed Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and many other companies since it\u2019s IPO in 2004. This isn\u2019t random. Domino\u2019s has been able to build a brand and continue to expand in the U.S. and internationally while rewarding shareholders.\n\nDomino\u2019s has a share repurchase program and also dolls out dividends each year. This combined with revenue and net income growth is a good recipe for any successful company.\n\nDomino\u2019s also seems to be the original cloud kitchen model. Many of its stores do not include seating which would increase capital expenditures. The majority of Domino\u2019s business is carryout or delivery.\n\n**Future Questions**\n\n1. **How long is Domino\u2019s runway?** Domino\u2019s is already a mature company with more than 17,000 stores worldwide. Future growth will come from cost efficiencies and some store openings, but I feel like it\u2019d be hard for Domino\u2019s to make a case that store count can double worldwide because of how many stores are already in existence. International store count can probably double at some point in time, but going from even \\~11,000 international stores to \\~22,000 will be a big challenge. The good part is that royalties and other fees associated with international franchises are basically pure profit since international franchises are operated by a master franchisee that takes care of all the headaches in foreign countries. Through operating leverage, if the international franchise store count doubles, then the profit will more than double. Domino\u2019s only has a market cap of \\~$15bn meanwhile companies like McDonald\u2019s have a market cap of \\~$150bn. Domino\u2019s definitely has room to expand, so if I were to do a deep dive on Domino\u2019s I\u2019d have to answer the question of how many stores can Domino\u2019s operate throughout the world.\n2. **What effect does Uber, Grubhub, DoorDash, and the food delivery market have on pizza delivery and carryout?** In the past, carryout and delivery were typically done by pizza companies. These companies often don\u2019t have any seating in their stores and therefore benefit by having less capital tied up in stores rather than inventory, buying back shares, or paying dividends. Families, college students, and professionals would order a pizza rather than ordering a bunch of different food from a Chinese restaurant or whatever other food option there is available. How does the new wave of food delivery companies impact pizza\u2019s delivery and carryout appeal? Do families increasingly order from somewhere else instead of the pastime of fresh pizza delivery? Are the costs of ordering from Grubhub, Uber Eats, DoorDash too expensive for a typical family of 4? Does the cheap cost of pizza relative to other options give Domino\u2019s and its pizza staying power in this new age of food delivery?\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDomino\u2019s is an interesting company that I\u2019d have to put in the more mature bucket. It\u2019d be interesting to figure out if food delivery is a net positive or net negative for Domino\u2019s and other pizza companies. Domino\u2019s has historically been a great investment for hopefully many people, but it might be too late for me. Domino\u2019s is already at the stage of giving out dividends to its shareholder base and that\u2019s not what I\u2019m personally looking for. I\u2019m a young investor so I\u2019m looking for growth and I\u2019m not worried about short-term volatility in the pursuit of long-term gains.\n\n**Fun Facts**\n\nThere are international Domino\u2019s franchises that are public companies. Not all of these companies are specific to Domino\u2019s and these firms often combine various franchises into one holding company. But here\u2019s a shortlist:\n\n* ASX: DMP - Domino\u2019s Pizza Enterprises\n* BMV: ALSEA - Alsea\n* L: DOM - Domino\u2019s Pizza Group\n* L: DPEU - DP Eurasia\n* NS: JUBLFOOD - Jubilant Foodworks\n\nDomino\u2019s has very different food options depending on local customs. Some of these were highlighted throughout Domino\u2019s 10-K such as the Mayo Jaga in Japan (bacon, potatoes, and sweet mayonnaise), the Saumoneta in France (light cream, potatoes, onions, smoked salmon, and dill), and some others. I thought these were funny and it\u2019s always interesting to learn more about different customs in foreign markets.\n\n**If you want more updates, feel free to message me!

The U.S. market is estimated to be \\~$37.8bn and steadily growing. This is the second-largest category in the broader $279bn QSR market. The QSR pizza industry is primarily comprised of delivery, dine-in, and carryout. Unsurprisingly carryout and delivery are the two largest segments.\n\nDomino\u2019s is the leading market share leader for U.S. pizza delivery and the second-largest market share for carryout. The four industry leaders, Pizza Hut, Papa John\u2019s Pizza, Domino\u2019s, and Little Caesars Pizza account for 61% of the U.S. pizza delivery market and 51% of the carryout market.\n\nThe international pizza market is more underdeveloped than the United States. Domino\u2019s is one of three companies with a global presence.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nDomino\u2019s was founded in 1960 by two brothers. The two brothers initially focused on opening stores near college campuses and military bases. Fast forward almost three decades and Bain Capital buys 93% of the business in 1998. A few years later, Bain proceeds to IPO Domino\u2019s in 2004, and it\u2019s been a public company ever since.\n\nDomino\u2019s has three different revenue segments:\n\n* U.S. Stores\n* International Franchises\n* Supply Chain\n\nWe\u2019ll dig into these different business lines and how they all work.\n\n**U.S. Stores**\n\nU.S. stores consist of both company-owned stores and franchised stores. Roughly 6% of all U.S. stores are company-owned. These stores are typically used for testing sites for new innovation as well as training and developing future talent.\n\nThere are more than 6,100 U.S. stores, with \\~340 stores being company-owned and \\~5,800 being franchisees. The \\~5,800 franchised stores are operated by 777 U.S. franchisees. These franchisees are able to benefit from Domino\u2019s brand image with a low capital investment. The largest U.S franchisee operates more than 176 locations.\n\nDomino\u2019s has a rigorous process for U.S. franchisees. Those interested in being a franchisee must manage a store for at least a year and graduate from its franchise management school program. This is successful as there is a 99% franchise agreement renewal rate. Franchisees must pay a 5.5% royalty fee on sales and certain technology fees.\n\nStores must also contribute 6% of sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns. These contributions go into Domino\u2019s National Advertising Fund, which is a not-for-profit advertising subsidiary of Domino\u2019s.\n\n**International Franchises**\n\nDomino\u2019s has more than 10,894 international franchises in more than 90 markets. The main source of revenue from these stores is royalty payments. Domino\u2019s top ten international markets account for 63% of international stores.\n\nDomino\u2019s grants franchisees exclusive rights to develop and sub-franchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in particular geographic regions. This means they can create their own Domino\u2019s in international markets. They control the franchisee options, the supply chain centers, and other decisions. These franchisees pay an initial one-time franchise fee and a fee upon the opening of each additional store. The master franchisee pays a continuous 3.0% royalty fee on sales,\n\n**Supply Chain**\n\nDomino\u2019s operates 19 dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers, 1 thin crust manufacturing center, 1 vegetable processing center, and 1 center providing equipment and supplies to U.S. and some international stores. The management team is continuously looking to expand and build more centers.\n\nDomino\u2019s sells food and supplies to more than 6,600 stores. Domino\u2019s believes that franchisees buy directly from them due to cost savings, efficiencies, quality offerings, and consistency. Franchisees also benefit from profit-sharing arrangements with supply chain centers. This program offers participating franchisees 50% of its regional supply chain center\u2019s pre-tax profits.\n\n**Total Addressable Market**\n\nThe global QSR pizza market is already well established with the biggest opportunity being in expanding in international markets and same-store sales growth in more established markets such as the U.S. One of my main concerns is just how big the pizza market can be. I feel as though the pizza market is already well-established, but Domino\u2019s talks about their fortressing strategy which is adding more Domino\u2019s stores within one area to improve on delivery times, customer service, and cost efficiencies (cheaper to deliver pizza the closer the customer), and other important areas.\n\n**Competitive Advantages**\n\n1. **Brand.** Domino\u2019s is one of the strongest brands in the world.

Given that retail investors have no chance to profit from traditional IPOs that hit the market after a 100% run up (ABNB, DASH, AI, U, etc.) reverse mergers have presented an excellent opportunity to evaluate and invest in new companies before they actually hit the market. Personally, I have made fantastic returns through a number of reverse mergers. That being said, not all reverse mergers are created equal. Some legitimate mature companies and high growth disrupters have emerged through reverse mergers: Utz, DraftKings, ChargePoint, OpenDoor, Virgin Galactic, Eos Energy, and Butterfly are just a few examples. However, many reverse mergers are performance chasing the EV hype by pursuing multi billion dollar acquisitions of EV start ups with 0 revenue for the forseeable future. I say good luck.\n\nOne reverse merger with massive upside potential at a conservative valuation is DMYD-Genius Sports. First, who is DYMD? dMY Technology Group [https://www.dmytechnology.com/team](https://www.dmytechnology.com/team) is led by CEO Niccolo de Masi, the former CEO of Glu Mobile. De Masi has consummated 25+ mergers and raised more than $1B in funding for various ventures. He seems to have a knack for the mobile/gaming sector, as his first reverse merger: DMYT is taking Rush Street, an igaming company, public. De Masi is a veteran of this sector, which makes Genius Sports Group an interesting target.\n\nWho is Genius Sports? Genius Sports Group is one of two large sports data providers (the other being SportRadar) that collects and sells live data to sportsbooks. This is incredibly important, as live betting needs constantly adjusted lines to reflect real time game updates. Genius Sports currently has contracts with the NCAA, PGA, NASCAR, FIBA, EPL, Bundesliga, and NBA, among other leagues, to be their sole or primary data provider. These partnerships have staying power, as these leagues are unlikely to change partners once they are locked in for multiyear contracts. Additionally, acquiring rights to official league data is expensive, thus making a high barrier of entry for new competitors. They have 220 customers including DraftKings, FanDuel, William Hill, MGM, PointsBet, and Caesars. Important to note: Genius takes 5% of revenues of events they cover from ALL sportsbooks. [https://geniussports.com/home/partners/](https://geniussports.com/home/partners/)\n\nGenius is above other reverse mergers due to its mature market position and strong financials. The company has been growing at a 30% CAGR over the last several years, with revenue growing 250% from 2016 to 2020 ($42M to $145M). 60% of revenue is recurring due to multi year contracts, and the top 10 customers only account for 30% of revenue, thus lowering flight risk of any particular customer. Genius is already EBITDA positive with 10% margins this year, and anticipates $68M in adjusted EBITDA (adjusted to ignore stock based compensation, a non-cash expense) with 29% margins in two years.\n\nIn a year where sports were disrupted by Covid, Genius still grew revenue from $116M to $145M. They also successfully resigned their contract with the NBA, ensuring a multi-year partnership with the premiere US basketball league. Outside of the betting market, Genius\u2019s ability to aggregate data has led to an interesting agreement with the NCAA. Until 2018, live data with college sports was incredibly inefficient. Genius signed a contract with the NCAA to create a new software: NCAA Livestats [https://geniussports.com/sports/sports-management/ncaa-case-study/](https://geniussports.com/sports/sports-management/ncaa-case-study/). This is a uniform software for all divisions of college sports. As a former college athlete myself, I reached out to some of the athletic support staff from my university. They raved about how Genius has improved efficiency and accuracy for college athletics. NCAA Livestats has overhauled the entire industry.\n\nI also think the NCAA presents the biggest upside catalyst for Genius: March Madness. March Madness was cancelled due to the pandemic last year, but betters placed $4.8B in bets on the tournament in 2019. Who has a monopoly on NCAA data? Genius. Who gets a 5% revenue share from ALL sports books for NCAA events? Genius. With the number of states with legalized betting doubling from 2018 to 2020, we could see upwards of $10B spent on March Madness this year.\n\nAlong with March Madness, secular tailwinds for sports betting suggest high upside for Genius moving forward. 46 out of 50 states have either passed or presented legislation to legalize sports betting. As states such as NY, CA, TX, and FL legalize betting, revenues streams will swell. Data will become increasingly important in this industry as live updates are constantly moving betting lines for books. With multi-year contracts with half of the US\u2019s professional leagues, Genius serves as an index for the entire industry.\n\nAdditionally, with Pfizer\u2019s vaccine approval, there is little to no risk of massive sports cancellations in the future. Genius still grew revenue during Covid\u2019s massive disruption. I imagine that the revenue numbers for 2021 will be fantastic.\n\nNow let\u2019s focus on the stock movement and valuation. Genius is valued as $1.4B, or 7.4x 2021 revenues. For a company with high CAGR and an industry with massive tailwinds, this seems like a fair, or cheap valuation. Note that Genius is trading at a steep discount to lower margin businesses such as sportsbooks Golden Nugget, DraftKings, and Penn. While investors have been chasing the next hot EV IPO, Genius has slowly climbed from $10 to $13. Last summer, a rumored FEAC-SportRadar merger led to FEAC pumping to $15+. SportRadar was worth $2.8B in 2018, presenting 60% upside from Genius\u2019 current price to reach its competitor\u2019s 2018 valuation! DMYD and Genius announced their merger in late October during a market downturn, thus letting it go overlooked. I think this is a sleeper reverse merger that will have a massive influx of news in Q1, as its merger aligns with the climax of college basketball and the beginning of March Madness. A single Benzinga article pumped the stock by almost 20% last week. Imagine the upside when the broader market realizes they can invest in the data behind the sports betting industry.\n\nPersonally, I am long $166k in DMYD stock, and have no intention of selling anytime soon.

I  didn't expect we were going to dip so hard at all.\n\nSecondly,  did I lose money? Yes. Did I wish I sold yesterday at $19 like  everybody else? Also yes. Did this company lost any value these last 2  days? No.\n\nI got too excited at  finally seeing some movement at all after holding for half a year. Was  this dumb? Yes. To all the people who bought the hype at my first post  and sold the news that same day for a 100%+, congratulations! I did not,  like many other people who believed in me. What did I learn? Green, not  Greed.\n\nThat aside and you can  call me crazy, but in my opinion this company is still extremely  undervalued. I didn't think at all that these 2 insane volatile days  would happen. I was just expecting steady growth after the deal with  China and their presentation yesterday.\n\nTo  all the people who said SLS was all hype: Yes, you were right, but only  in the short term. SLS was always long term for me. I held for over  half a year and I can wait longer.

SLS has  always been a company with extremely much short interest ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/sls](https://fintel.io/ss/us/sls)).  It really depends when the Management Team of SLS will hold more press  conferences and if we can get enough volume to squeeze the shorts ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)).   What I do know is that this moment will come certainly somewhere in  the next 6 months. Is this too long for some people? Absolutely, but as I  said this will always be long term for me.\n\nI sold for a loss yesterday. Should I buy in again?\n\n\\-  SLS is an extremely volatile stock, like you noticed these last 2 days.  Everybody trades/invests different. Ask yourself if you can hold  through different dips and that during a couple weeks/months? Secondly, I  am just a random guy on the internet giving out my opinion.

It really depends when the Management Team of SLS will hold more press  conferences and if we can get enough volume to squeeze the shorts ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)).   What I do know is that this moment will come certainly somewhere in  the next 6 months. Is this too long for some people? Absolutely, but as I  said this will always be long term for me.\n\nI sold for a loss yesterday. Should I buy in again?\n\n\\-  SLS is an extremely volatile stock, like you noticed these last 2 days.  Everybody trades/invests different. Ask yourself if you can hold  through different dips and that during a couple weeks/months? Secondly, I  am just a random guy on the internet giving out my opinion.

We've put together an analysis on their IPO below, with diagrams available at our blog post below. Appreciate any feedback and discussion!\n\n**Pre-IPO: Everything you need to know about AbCellera**\n\n* AbCellera is expected to IPO on Nasdaq on **December 10, 2020**; shares are expected to price between $14 to $17 a share, raising as much as $391 million.\n* AbCellera is a Vancouver-based AI-powered drug discovery platform with backing from Peter Thiel, known for its leading platform and COVID-19 treatment in partnership with Eli Lilly\n* Its most successful antibody (LY-Cov555)/bamlanivimab has recently been granted emergency approval by Health Canada and the FDA - expected to receive &gt;$100mn in royalties\n* Its unique, proprietary business model and experienced management &amp; board positions AbCellera for long-term success \n* We see AbCellera as a play on LY-Cov555 success and the near-term delivery of other antibody candidates, with the downside of potential headline risk \n\nThe Vancouver-based AI drug discovery platform that has caught the eye of investors including Peter Thiel for its leading platform and the development of its COVID-19 treatment with Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), AbCellera Biologics Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cAbCellera\u201d) is set to IPO (NASDAQ: ABCL) with Credit Suisse as lead left underwriter ([prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1703057/000119312520299507/d29983ds1.htm) filed November 20, 2020). \n\n***Here\u2019s all you need to know about AbCellera and its proposed IPO.***\n\n# Outline\n\n1. Business Model\n2. Recent Developments / Company Timeline\n3. Management Team &amp; Board Overview\n4. Competitive Landscape\n5. IPO Details\n6. Financial Analysis\n7. Valuation\n8. The Bottom Line \n\n# AbCellera Business Model\n\nAbCellera provides drug developers with a platform to find antibody candidates for drug research. Its AI-powered full-stack platform searches and analyzes real-world immune system databases to find leads that are subsequently used for clinical R&amp;D. Unlike its competitors, AbCellera operates along the entire value chain from sourcing to the delivery of antibody candidates; this solves the existing problem of either inadequate/outdated discovery approaches or using multiple fragmented solutions (costly and inefficient). \n\nIt is important to note what AbCellera is not - a drug developer. Instead, Abcellera lends their technology to pharmaceutical companies, both large and small, in hopes of speeding up discovery times for antibody therapies. This in turn leads to cost savings for the drug developer, quicker times to clinical trials, and faster delivery of medical solutions. They define themselves as the \u201cOperating System for Antibody Discovery\u201d.  \n\nIt follows then that revenues are project driven - the more programs authorized by drug developers, the more fees Abcellera earns. Abcellera sees long term value in the business to be driven off downstream and royalty payments that are more stable and are a consequence of successful discovery programs. We explore this notion later in the article. To summarize, revenues streams are as follows: \n\n1. Licensing / Research Fees (68% of revenue, 9 months ended September 30, 2020): payments for technology access and performing research\n2. Milestone Payments (32% of revenue): downstream payments for clinical/commercial milestones\n   1. *We note that only one program to date, LY-CoV555 (Eli Lilly), has resulted in milestone payments*\n3. Royalties: royalties on net sales of any approved therapeutics\n   1. *As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera has yet to receive any royalties*\n   2. *Royalties generally will range from low-single digit for non-COVID targets to mid-teens to mid-twenties for COVID targets*\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, AbCellera had 94 discovery programs either completed, in-progress, or under contract, with a few public key partnerships below. Some of AbCellera\u2019s recent, public partnerships are as follows:\n\n*Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY)* \\- On March 12, 2020, AbCellera and Lilly announced to co-develop antibody therapies for the treatment of COVID-19, the potential treatment LY-CoV555 accelerated due to Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program. As part of the agreement, AbCellera received an upfront payment of $25mn and is entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $29mn of milestone payments. As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera has received $8mn related to LY-CoV555 and is eligible to receive royalties on aggregate sales (including Lilly\u2019s $375mn and $312.5mn contracts with the US government and US Army Contracting Command respectively).\n\n*Invetx* \\- On February 23, 2020, AbCellera originally entered a multi-year, multi-target partnership agreement with Invetx. Based on the successful delivery of research programs under the original agreement, the scope of the collaboration has been expanded to include multiple new targets over several years on November 19, 2020.\n\n*Kodiak Sciences (NASDAQ: KOD)*  \\- After a successful collaboration in 2016, AbCellera and Kodiak Sciences announced a new partnership on October 29. 2020 to generate therapeutic antibody candidates in ophthalmology.\n\n*IGM Biosciences (NASDAQ: IGMS)* \\- AbCellera and IGM Biosciences announced on September 24, 2020, that they have entered into a multi-year, multi-target strategic research collaboration and license agreement to facilitate the discovery and development of novel IgM antibodies. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7*AbCellera\u2019s solutions to existing challenges.*\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n*The diagrams above illustrate AbCellera\u2019s partnerships over time; the Company continues to expand partnerships in line with its growth strategy.*\n\nAbCellera\u2019s business strategy (per prospectus) is focused on (i) using the drug discovery platform to unlock new opportunities for therapeutic antibody development; and (ii) allowing partners to access the platform to reduce delays and costs associated with setting up drug discovery capabilities. The firm continues to develop their strategy, building a stronger platform with the idea of higher downstreams royalties negotiated. \ud83d\udcf7\n\n*AbCellera\u2019s strategy creates a positive feedback loop through which each round of research program improves the speed and efficiency of the next round of data generation*\n\n# Recent Developments / Company Timeline\n\n1. In March 2020, AbCellera entered into a discovery partnership with Eli Lilly and Company, to perform discovery research for a number of targets for Lilly that will result in antibodies for Lilly to develop and potentially commercialize. \n2. In April 2020, AbCellera entered into a multi-year agreement with the Canadian government\u2019s Strategic Innovation Fund, and CAD $175.6mn ($125.6mn) was committed by the Government of Canada, of which &gt;$110mn remains and is intended to be used to build a GMP facility.\n3. In June 2020, LY-Cov555 moved to first in-inhuman testing and progressed to Phase 3 clinical trials. \n4. In November 2020, LY-CoV555 was granted emergency-use authorization by the FDA and Health Canada. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, AbCellera received an aggregate of $8.0mn upon the satisfaction of clinical milestones by Lilly. \n5. In November 2020, AbCellera acquired Trianni for $90.0mn. Trianni develops transgenic mice that provide a source of fully-human antibodies for therapeutic antibody candidates. Trianni mouse technology will allow AbCellera to generate more high-quality antibodies against difficult targets and improve the speed of the discovery programs, which in turn should create higher leverage when negotiating downstream royalties. In addition to strategic value, Trianni also generates revenues through mouse sales, platform licensing fees and associated downstream milestone payments.\n\n**Defining Bamlanivimab**\n\nWhile any treatment for COVID-19 is big news for the world community, we\u2019d like to emphasize what LY-CoV555/Bamlanivimab  is not - a vaccine, a cure, or even a recovery aid for COVID-19.\n\nRather, clinical trials showed a 72% reduction in hospitalization rates within patients that have already been diagnosed with COVID-19. We make an analogy and compare the effect of bamlanivimab to blood clotting - it stops from excessive bleeding (hospitalization) when a wound or blood vessel is burst (diagnosis of COVID-19). For already hospitalized patients, studies have shown little to effect in helping patients recover from the advanced stages of COVID-19. Other clinical trials evaluating Bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and for recovery purposes remain active.\n\nThis carries some short and long term implications. Abcellera will likely benefit both in the short and long term if the treatment becomes widely used in hospitals. They may also receive more milestones and royalty payments from governments and drug developers. However, the growth story will deteriorate as vaccines, which are already in federal approval stages, become available. Vaccines, herd immunity and measures to avoid the spread of COVID-19 will reduce growth opportunities for Bamlanivimab to be a continued factor in Abcellera\u2019s growth. Finally, any royalties from the sale of Bamlanivimab remains unknown as no further disclosures have been made to date. \n\nNonetheless, the drug received US FDA approval, with Eli Lilly inking an agreement to supply the U.S government to provide 300,000 vials to high risk patients.for a sum of $375,000,000, or \\~$1,250 a vial. Health Canada has also approved the use of the treatment, \n\nCuriously, Abcellera proposed $200Mn comes shortly after a slew of positive news for the firm. This could come as a redflag to some, with the view that the firm is slapping as much lipstick as possible on the pig to sell it. However, we remain optimistic with the view that all the recent developments are timely given the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare the firm for future growth.    \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n*Company Timeline: AbCellera has demonstrated consistent growth and has generated positive operating cash flow cumulatively since its inception in 2012.* \n\n# Management Team &amp; BOD Overview\n\nAbCellera\u2019s management team is highly experienced with significant experience in related industries. AbCellera has also continued to bolster its board of directors with high-profile names including Peter Thiel (Palantir, Paypal, Facebook) and John Montalbano (CPPIB) ahead of its IPO. \n\nWith its recent additions, we view AbCellera\u2019s management team and board as a strength.\n\n***Executive Officers***   ***Positions***\n\nCarl L. G. Hansen, Ph.D.  Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nAndrew Booth    Chief Financial Officer\n\nV\u00e9ronique Lecault, Ph.D.  Chief Operating Officer and Director\n\nTryn Stimart    Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary\n\n***Non-Employee Directors***\n\nMichael Hayden, Ph.D.  Director\n\nJohn S. Montalbano   Director\n\nPeter Thiel    Director\n\n***Director Nominee***\n\nJohn Edward Hamer, Ph.D.  Director Nominee (nominated to join in December 2020)\n\nShareholders are detailed below:\n\n*\ud83d\udcf7*\n\n# Competitive Environment\n\nAbCellera\u2019s current market position as a full-stack service provider provides meaningful barriers to entry, with its primary competitors providing services at some point along its value chain. The integrated nature of AbCellera\u2019s services (provides integrated services from start to end), in addition to the nature of its AI-platform (interconnection and scale enable AI to continuously become more efficient) is a competitive advantage.\n\nThat being said, the life sciences and biotech platform technology market is highly competitive; technical competitors at different stages of AbCellera\u2019s platform in the following fields are detailed below:\n\nSingle-cell screening: Berkeley Lights Inc. *(NASDAQ: BLI)*, HiFiBio Inc., Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. *(NASDAQ: LGND)*, and Sphere Fluidics Ltd.\n\nAntibody RepSeq: 10X Genomics Inc. *(NASDAQ: TXG)*, Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp. *(NASDAQ: ADPT)*, *Atreca Inc (NASDAQ: BCEL)*. and Distributed Bio Inc.\n\nBispecific antibody engineering: Abbvie Inc. *(NYSE:ABBV)*, Genmab A/S, Merus N.V. and Zymeworks Inc. *(NYSE:ZYME)*\n\nDiscovery using genetically engineered rodents: Ablexis LLC, Crescendo Biologics Ltd., Harbour Antibodies BV, Kymab Ltd., Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc *(NASDAQ: LGND)*. and RenBio Inc.\n\nIn addition, AbCellera competes with a variety of fee-for-service contract research organizations, in most cases using legacy technologies that would compete with one or more steps in AbCellera\u2019s technology stack. Organizations may also elect to develop their workflows on legacy systems rather than rely on AbCellera\u2019s platform.\n\n# IPO Details\n\nThe IPO will be jointly underwritten by Credit Suisse (left lead), Stifel, Berenberg, SVB (healthcare specialist) and BMO Capital Markets. \n\nOn Monday December 7 2020, AbCellera said it is offering 23 million shares in the IPO, which is expected to price between $14 to $17 a share. The company could raise as much as $391 million. The pro forma adjusted common shares count after the IPO is \\~265.95mn shares. This puts AbCellera at a market capitalization of \\~$4.1bn based on $15.5 IPO price.\n\n# Financial Analysis\n\nIn this part of our analysis, we will take a deeper dive into the valuation, pro forma financials, capital structure, and go-forward expectations for the business. The below provides a brief overview of the financials. We view the company to be financially healthy, given the low capitalization and limited contractual obligations, supported by continued licensing/research revenue and royalties from LY-CoV555 and other contracts.\n\n**Revenue** has grown at a 109% CAGR since 2014, primarily driven by increased research fees (driven by the number and quality of programs under contract) and milestone fees (AbCellera received its first milestone fee in 2020 from Lilly of $8mn). September 2020 YTD revenue was \\~$25mn (\\~$30mn pro forma for Trianni acquisition).\n\n**Key Revenue Drivers** in the near term will include milestone payments on existing contracts and royalty payments from Lilly for LY-CoV555. The company is eligible for royalties in low- to mid-teens for aggregate sales below $125mn and mid-teens to mid-twenties on aggregate sales above $125mn. Assuming a 20% royalty on existing US contracts (\\~$690mn), this would drive an incremental $137mn of revenue (excluding an additional $21mn available through milestone payments).\n\nWe noted that Abcellera will likely move towards a recurring revenue model as the business develops more partnerships and use of their technology is more prevalent (and successful) in the industry. Details of future milestone payments and royalty payments are set out through partnership agreements with the drug developers. While we have no insight into the specifics of these arrangements, we expect more transparency going forward as Abcellera sees continued success in their programs. \n\n**Liquidity** will be bolstered by the equity raise, with the use of proceeds used to continue making investments in R&amp;D, building its business development team and other general corporate purposes. AbCellera has more than $8mn of total future contractual obligations and commitments (as of September 30, 2020), which can be financed through cash on hand or other debt (AbCellera has demonstrated access to bank and private placement debt).\n\n***Capital Structure*** will look significantly different post-IPO; the pro forma adjusted \\~265.95mn common shares, includes 23mn IPO shares issue, \\~81.2mn convertible preferred shares, and \\~7.63mn shares from convertible notes based on $15.5 IPO price. The company also has \n\n* \\~13mn common shares reserved for issuance under their current plan, as of September 30, 2020, which shares will cease to be available for issuance at the time their 2020 Plan becomes effective.\n* \\~21mn common shares to be reserved for future issuance under the 2020 Plan\n* 27mn common shares to be reserved for future issuance under our 2020 Employee Share Purchase Plan\n\n**Valuation**\n\n**Comparable Companies**\n\n*Information gathered as of November 26, 2020.*\n\nRelay Therapeutics *(Nasdaq: RLAY)* \\- Relay Therapeutics is a clinical-stage medicines company transforming the drug discovery process with the goal of bringing therapies to patients.

The shares began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on June 19, 2020. The first trading day closed at \\~$39 per share, which is 95% above the $20 IPO price. As of November 26, 2020, The company currently has a market cap of \\~$1.7bn.\n\nAlthough the goal of the above companies is to discover and develop potential drugs or therapies to satisfy different requirements of the patients, the business model and strategy are very much similar to what AbCellera is aiming to achieve with its IPO. Some of the notable goals are listed below:\n\n* Advance its lead product candidate as well as other potential candidates.\n* Leverage its proprietary discovery platform by expanding its library and harnessing the insights and data generated from each research program.\n* Build a pipeline of additional drugs in their own fields of expertise.\n* Explore and evaluate additional partnerships or collaborations to maximize commercial opportunities. \n* Become a market leader in its own field of research.\n\n# The Bottom Line\n\nOur Investment Thesis: we think that AbCellera is well-positioned to grow as a leader in an attractive, lucrative, and fragmented industry, supported by a strong management team and board. As the Company continues to find success, AbCellera will transition from its position today as a company heavily dependent on near-term binary outcomes (reliance on a few partnerships with milestone payments for revenue) to a more stable (royalty cash flows) company with significant upside for growth.\n\n## The Positives:\n\n* World-class management &amp; shareholder support\n   * *Experienced executive team with deep experience (STEMCELL, Precision NanoSystems)*\n   * *Strong and supportive long-term minority shareholders and experience board*\n* Leading industry platform with barriers to entry\n   * *Full-stack solution is a unique value proposition vs. its competitors.*\n   * *Data generated through discovery partnerships provide the basis for training AI modules that yield new insights into antibody responses; with each research program, the platform becomes more effective and efficient*\n   * *Benefits from natural antibody optimization vs \u201cgenetically made\u201d antibodies from legacy systems*\n* Scalable business with a large addressable market\n   * *AI platform and partnership strategy enables organic growth with minimal funding requirements*\n   * *In 2019, antibody-based therapeutics accounted for over $140 billion in sales worldwide and represented five of the top 10 selling therapeutics.*\n* The business model enables diversified revenue long-term stream\n   * *Three pronged revenue stream: research, milestone payments, royalties.*\n   * *Revenue to stabilize as therapeutics are approved and come to market (e.g. LY-CoV555)*\n* COVID upside\n   * *Bamlanivimab (Eli Lilly collaboration, LY-CoV555) approved for treatment by Health Canada and the FDA*\n   * *Royalties and future milestone payments to drive near-term revenue growth*\n\nThe Risks:\n\n* **Headline Risk:** milestone payments and earnings are dependent on unknown, binary outcomes (excluding royalties).\n   * Timing and quantum of LY-Cov555 royalties are unknown, delays or other negative developments would limit near-term upside\n   * Lack of transparency - disclosure of partnerships is at the mercy of AbCellera\u2019s customers, with little to no control over public disclosure from partners.\n* **Customer Risk:** AbCellera\u2019s revenue stream relies on its partnerships as if it cannot maintain and expand current partnerships or failure to address the needs of customers could impact the market acceptance of the platform. \n   * As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera had 94 discovery programs that were either completed, in progress or under contract, including 71 with the potential for milestone and royalty payments.\n* **Lack of traction:** Abcellera relies on their technology and partners\u2019 ability to advance a product into clinical development and medical use. Since the launch of their partnership program in 2015, Abcellera has only 1 program lead to clinical milestone payments. If investors are to put a premium on their valuation, Abcellera will need to show rapid adoption of their technology within the industry and successful delivery of therapies to the population. \n   * We expect larger, high profile antibody discoveries (through the use of Abcellera\u2019s technology) to receive higher coverage and perhaps prompt drug makers to disclose Abcellera\u2019s involvement.  \n\nhttps://seeking alpha.com/instablog/52796529-breakwater-research/5525083-pre-ipo-everything-you-need-to-know-abcellera-part-i", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 958951, "public", "self", "AbCellera's (ABCL) IPO: Everything You Need to Know about the Peter Thiel-backed, AI-powered, COVID-treatment approved, Biotech Company", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ka7m5b/abcelleras_abcl_ipo_everything_you_need_to_know/", "all_ads", 6, 1607567581.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "BreakwaterResearch", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_90xzlxpy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1607571181, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ka7m5b/abcelleras_abcl_ipo_everything_you_need_to_know/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ka7m5b", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 36, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/ka7m5b/abcelleras_abcl_ipo_everything_you_need_to_know/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1607571192, "score": 1, "selftext": "  \n\nHi all,\n\nWe're excited about AbCellera's IPO and noticed nobody is really paying attention or interested. We've put together an analysis on their IPO below, with diagrams available at our blog post below. Appreciate any feedback and discussion!\n\n**Pre-IPO: Everything you need to know about AbCellera**\n\n* AbCellera is expected to IPO on Nasdaq on **December 10, 2020**; shares are expected to price between $14 to $17 a share, raising as much as $391 million.\n* AbCellera is a Vancouver-based AI-powered drug discovery platform with backing from Peter Thiel, known for its leading platform and COVID-19 treatment in partnership with Eli Lilly\n* Its most successful antibody (LY-Cov555)/bamlanivimab has recently been granted emergency approval by Health Canada and the FDA - expected to receive &gt;$100mn in royalties\n* Its unique, proprietary business model and experienced management &amp; board positions AbCellera for long-term success \n* We see AbCellera as a play on LY-Cov555 success and the near-term delivery of other antibody candidates, with the downside of potential headline risk \n\nThe Vancouver-based AI drug discovery platform that has caught the eye of investors including Peter Thiel for its leading platform and the development of its COVID-19 treatment with Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), AbCellera Biologics Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cAbCellera\u201d) is set to IPO (NASDAQ: ABCL) with Credit Suisse as lead left underwriter ([prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1703057/000119312520299507/d29983ds1.htm) filed November 20, 2020). \n\n***Here\u2019s all you need to know about AbCellera and its proposed IPO.***\n\n# Outline\n\n1. Business Model\n2. Recent Developments / Company Timeline\n3. Management Team &amp; Board Overview\n4. Competitive Landscape\n5. IPO Details\n6. Financial Analysis\n7. Valuation\n8. The Bottom Line \n\n# AbCellera Business Model\n\nAbCellera provides drug developers with a platform to find antibody candidates for drug research. Its AI-powered full-stack platform searches and analyzes real-world immune system databases to find leads that are subsequently used for clinical R&amp;D. Unlike its competitors, AbCellera operates along the entire value chain from sourcing to the delivery of antibody candidates; this solves the existing problem of either inadequate/outdated discovery approaches or using multiple fragmented solutions (costly and inefficient). \n\nIt is important to note what AbCellera is not - a drug developer. Instead, Abcellera lends their technology to pharmaceutical companies, both large and small, in hopes of speeding up discovery times for antibody therapies. This in turn leads to cost savings for the drug developer, quicker times to clinical trials, and faster delivery of medical solutions. They define themselves as the \u201cOperating System for Antibody Discovery\u201d.  \n\nIt follows then that revenues are project driven - the more programs authorized by drug developers, the more fees Abcellera earns. Abcellera sees long term value in the business to be driven off downstream and royalty payments that are more stable and are a consequence of successful discovery programs. We explore this notion later in the article. To summarize, revenues streams are as follows: \n\n1. Licensing / Research Fees (68% of revenue, 9 months ended September 30, 2020): payments for technology access and performing research\n2. Milestone Payments (32% of revenue): downstream payments for clinical/commercial milestones\n   1. *We note that only one program to date, LY-CoV555 (Eli Lilly), has resulted in milestone payments*\n3. Royalties: royalties on net sales of any approved therapeutics\n   1. *As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera has yet to receive any royalties*\n   2. *Royalties generally will range from low-single digit for non-COVID targets to mid-teens to mid-twenties for COVID targets*\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, AbCellera had 94 discovery programs either completed, in-progress, or under contract, with a few public key partnerships below. Some of AbCellera\u2019s recent, public partnerships are as follows:\n\n*Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY)* \\- On March 12, 2020, AbCellera and Lilly announced to co-develop antibody therapies for the treatment of COVID-19, the potential treatment LY-CoV555 accelerated due to Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program. As part of the agreement, AbCellera received an upfront payment of $25mn and is entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $29mn of milestone payments. As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera has received $8mn related to LY-CoV555 and is eligible to receive royalties on aggregate sales (including Lilly\u2019s $375mn and $312.5mn contracts with the US government and US Army Contracting Command respectively).\n\n*Invetx* \\- On February 23, 2020, AbCellera originally entered a multi-year, multi-target partnership agreement with Invetx. Based on the successful delivery of research programs under the original agreement, the scope of the collaboration has been expanded to include multiple new targets over several years on November 19, 2020.\n\n*Kodiak Sciences (NASDAQ: KOD)*  \\- After a successful collaboration in 2016, AbCellera and Kodiak Sciences announced a new partnership on October 29. 2020 to generate therapeutic antibody candidates in ophthalmology.\n\n*IGM Biosciences (NASDAQ: IGMS)* \\- AbCellera and IGM Biosciences announced on September 24, 2020, that they have entered into a multi-year, multi-target strategic research collaboration and license agreement to facilitate the discovery and development of novel IgM antibodies. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7*AbCellera\u2019s solutions to existing challenges.*\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n*The diagrams above illustrate AbCellera\u2019s partnerships over time; the Company continues to expand partnerships in line with its growth strategy.*\n\nAbCellera\u2019s business strategy (per prospectus) is focused on (i) using the drug discovery platform to unlock new opportunities for therapeutic antibody development; and (ii) allowing partners to access the platform to reduce delays and costs associated with setting up drug discovery capabilities. The firm continues to develop their strategy, building a stronger platform with the idea of higher downstreams royalties negotiated. \ud83d\udcf7\n\n*AbCellera\u2019s strategy creates a positive feedback loop through which each round of research program improves the speed and efficiency of the next round of data generation*\n\n# Recent Developments / Company Timeline\n\n1. In March 2020, AbCellera entered into a discovery partnership with Eli Lilly and Company, to perform discovery research for a number of targets for Lilly that will result in antibodies for Lilly to develop and potentially commercialize. \n2. In April 2020, AbCellera entered into a multi-year agreement with the Canadian government\u2019s Strategic Innovation Fund, and CAD $175.6mn ($125.6mn) was committed by the Government of Canada, of which &gt;$110mn remains and is intended to be used to build a GMP facility.\n3. In June 2020, LY-Cov555 moved to first in-inhuman testing and progressed to Phase 3 clinical trials. \n4. In November 2020, LY-CoV555 was granted emergency-use authorization by the FDA and Health Canada. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, AbCellera received an aggregate of $8.0mn upon the satisfaction of clinical milestones by Lilly. \n5. In November 2020, AbCellera acquired Trianni for $90.0mn. Trianni develops transgenic mice that provide a source of fully-human antibodies for therapeutic antibody candidates. Trianni mouse technology will allow AbCellera to generate more high-quality antibodies against difficult targets and improve the speed of the discovery programs, which in turn should create higher leverage when negotiating downstream royalties. In addition to strategic value, Trianni also generates revenues through mouse sales, platform licensing fees and associated downstream milestone payments.\n\n**Defining Bamlanivimab**\n\nWhile any treatment for COVID-19 is big news for the world community, we\u2019d like to emphasize what LY-CoV555/Bamlanivimab  is not - a vaccine, a cure, or even a recovery aid for COVID-19.\n\nRather, clinical trials showed a 72% reduction in hospitalization rates within patients that have already been diagnosed with COVID-19. We make an analogy and compare the effect of bamlanivimab to blood clotting - it stops from excessive bleeding (hospitalization) when a wound or blood vessel is burst (diagnosis of COVID-19). For already hospitalized patients, studies have shown little to effect in helping patients recover from the advanced stages of COVID-19. Other clinical trials evaluating Bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and for recovery purposes remain active.\n\nThis carries some short and long term implications. Abcellera will likely benefit both in the short and long term if the treatment becomes widely used in hospitals. They may also receive more milestones and royalty payments from governments and drug developers. However, the growth story will deteriorate as vaccines, which are already in federal approval stages, become available. Vaccines, herd immunity and measures to avoid the spread of COVID-19 will reduce growth opportunities for Bamlanivimab to be a continued factor in Abcellera\u2019s growth. Finally, any royalties from the sale of Bamlanivimab remains unknown as no further disclosures have been made to date. \n\nNonetheless, the drug received US FDA approval, with Eli Lilly inking an agreement to supply the U.S government to provide 300,000 vials to high risk patients.for a sum of $375,000,000, or \\~$1,250 a vial. Health Canada has also approved the use of the treatment, \n\nCuriously, Abcellera proposed $200Mn comes shortly after a slew of positive news for the firm. This could come as a redflag to some, with the view that the firm is slapping as much lipstick as possible on the pig to sell it. However, we remain optimistic with the view that all the recent developments are timely given the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare the firm for future growth.    \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n*Company Timeline: AbCellera has demonstrated consistent growth and has generated positive operating cash flow cumulatively since its inception in 2012.* \n\n# Management Team &amp; BOD Overview\n\nAbCellera\u2019s management team is highly experienced with significant experience in related industries. AbCellera has also continued to bolster its board of directors with high-profile names including Peter Thiel (Palantir, Paypal, Facebook) and John Montalbano (CPPIB) ahead of its IPO. \n\nWith its recent additions, we view AbCellera\u2019s management team and board as a strength.\n\n***Executive Officers***   ***Positions***\n\nCarl L. G. Hansen, Ph.D.  Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nAndrew Booth    Chief Financial Officer\n\nV\u00e9ronique Lecault, Ph.D.  Chief Operating Officer and Director\n\nTryn Stimart    Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary\n\n***Non-Employee Directors***\n\nMichael Hayden, Ph.D.  Director\n\nJohn S. Montalbano   Director\n\nPeter Thiel    Director\n\n***Director Nominee***\n\nJohn Edward Hamer, Ph.D.  Director Nominee (nominated to join in December 2020)\n\nShareholders are detailed below:\n\n*\ud83d\udcf7*\n\n# Competitive Environment\n\nAbCellera\u2019s current market position as a full-stack service provider provides meaningful barriers to entry, with its primary competitors providing services at some point along its value chain. The integrated nature of AbCellera\u2019s services (provides integrated services from start to end), in addition to the nature of its AI-platform (interconnection and scale enable AI to continuously become more efficient) is a competitive advantage.\n\nThat being said, the life sciences and biotech platform technology market is highly competitive; technical competitors at different stages of AbCellera\u2019s platform in the following fields are detailed below:\n\nSingle-cell screening: Berkeley Lights Inc. *(NASDAQ: BLI)*, HiFiBio Inc., Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. *(NASDAQ: LGND)*, and Sphere Fluidics Ltd.\n\nAntibody RepSeq: 10X Genomics Inc. *(NASDAQ: TXG)*, Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp. *(NASDAQ: ADPT)*, *Atreca Inc (NASDAQ: BCEL)*. and Distributed Bio Inc.\n\nBispecific antibody engineering: Abbvie Inc. *(NYSE:ABBV)*, Genmab A/S, Merus N.V. and Zymeworks Inc. *(NYSE:ZYME)*\n\nDiscovery using genetically engineered rodents: Ablexis LLC, Crescendo Biologics Ltd., Harbour Antibodies BV, Kymab Ltd., Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc *(NASDAQ: LGND)*. and RenBio Inc.\n\nIn addition, AbCellera competes with a variety of fee-for-service contract research organizations, in most cases using legacy technologies that would compete with one or more steps in AbCellera\u2019s technology stack. Organizations may also elect to develop their workflows on legacy systems rather than rely on AbCellera\u2019s platform.\n\n# IPO Details\n\nThe IPO will be jointly underwritten by Credit Suisse (left lead), Stifel, Berenberg, SVB (healthcare specialist) and BMO Capital Markets. \n\nOn Monday December 7 2020, AbCellera said it is offering 23 million shares in the IPO, which is expected to price between $14 to $17 a share. The company could raise as much as $391 million. The pro forma adjusted common shares count after the IPO is \\~265.95mn shares. This puts AbCellera at a market capitalization of \\~$4.1bn based on $15.5 IPO price.\n\n# Financial Analysis\n\nIn this part of our analysis, we will take a deeper dive into the valuation, pro forma financials, capital structure, and go-forward expectations for the business. The below provides a brief overview of the financials. We view the company to be financially healthy, given the low capitalization and limited contractual obligations, supported by continued licensing/research revenue and royalties from LY-CoV555 and other contracts.\n\n**Revenue** has grown at a 109% CAGR since 2014, primarily driven by increased research fees (driven by the number and quality of programs under contract) and milestone fees (AbCellera received its first milestone fee in 2020 from Lilly of $8mn). September 2020 YTD revenue was \\~$25mn (\\~$30mn pro forma for Trianni acquisition).\n\n**Key Revenue Drivers** in the near term will include milestone payments on existing contracts and royalty payments from Lilly for LY-CoV555. The company is eligible for royalties in low- to mid-teens for aggregate sales below $125mn and mid-teens to mid-twenties on aggregate sales above $125mn. Assuming a 20% royalty on existing US contracts (\\~$690mn), this would drive an incremental $137mn of revenue (excluding an additional $21mn available through milestone payments).\n\nWe noted that Abcellera will likely move towards a recurring revenue model as the business develops more partnerships and use of their technology is more prevalent (and successful) in the industry. Details of future milestone payments and royalty payments are set out through partnership agreements with the drug developers. While we have no insight into the specifics of these arrangements, we expect more transparency going forward as Abcellera sees continued success in their programs. \n\n**Liquidity** will be bolstered by the equity raise, with the use of proceeds used to continue making investments in R&amp;D, building its business development team and other general corporate purposes. AbCellera has more than $8mn of total future contractual obligations and commitments (as of September 30, 2020), which can be financed through cash on hand or other debt (AbCellera has demonstrated access to bank and private placement debt).\n\n***Capital Structure*** will look significantly different post-IPO; the pro forma adjusted \\~265.95mn common shares, includes 23mn IPO shares issue, \\~81.2mn convertible preferred shares, and \\~7.63mn shares from convertible notes based on $15.5 IPO price. The company also has \n\n* \\~13mn common shares reserved for issuance under their current plan, as of September 30, 2020, which shares will cease to be available for issuance at the time their 2020 Plan becomes effective.\n* \\~21mn common shares to be reserved for future issuance under the 2020 Plan\n* 27mn common shares to be reserved for future issuance under our 2020 Employee Share Purchase Plan\n\n**Valuation**\n\n**Comparable Companies**\n\n*Information gathered as of November 26, 2020.*\n\nRelay Therapeutics *(Nasdaq: RLAY)* \\- Relay Therapeutics is a clinical-stage medicines company transforming the drug discovery process with the goal of bringing therapies to patients.

Forma leverages its innovative drug discovery platform to address challenging targets and develop an internal pipeline of drugs. The company currently has five candidates, with two in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials respectively. The company also has two out-licensed program candidates in Phase 1. Forma announced the pricing of its initial public offering of \\~16mn shares, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to \\~2mn additional common shares at $20 per share. The shares began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on June 19, 2020. The first trading day closed at \\~$39 per share, which is 95% above the $20 IPO price. As of November 26, 2020, The company currently has a market cap of \\~$1.7bn.\n\nAlthough the goal of the above companies is to discover and develop potential drugs or therapies to satisfy different requirements of the patients, the business model and strategy are very much similar to what AbCellera is aiming to achieve with its IPO. Some of the notable goals are listed below:\n\n* Advance its lead product candidate as well as other potential candidates.\n* Leverage its proprietary discovery platform by expanding its library and harnessing the insights and data generated from each research program.\n* Build a pipeline of additional drugs in their own fields of expertise.\n* Explore and evaluate additional partnerships or collaborations to maximize commercial opportunities. \n* Become a market leader in its own field of research.\n\n# The Bottom Line\n\nOur Investment Thesis: we think that AbCellera is well-positioned to grow as a leader in an attractive, lucrative, and fragmented industry, supported by a strong management team and board. As the Company continues to find success, AbCellera will transition from its position today as a company heavily dependent on near-term binary outcomes (reliance on a few partnerships with milestone payments for revenue) to a more stable (royalty cash flows) company with significant upside for growth.\n\n## The Positives:\n\n* World-class management &amp; shareholder support\n   * *Experienced executive team with deep experience (STEMCELL, Precision NanoSystems)*\n   * *Strong and supportive long-term minority shareholders and experience board*\n* Leading industry platform with barriers to entry\n   * *Full-stack solution is a unique value proposition vs. its competitors.*\n   * *Data generated through discovery partnerships provide the basis for training AI modules that yield new insights into antibody responses; with each research program, the platform becomes more effective and efficient*\n   * *Benefits from natural antibody optimization vs \u201cgenetically made\u201d antibodies from legacy systems*\n* Scalable business with a large addressable market\n   * *AI platform and partnership strategy enables organic growth with minimal funding requirements*\n   * *In 2019, antibody-based therapeutics accounted for over $140 billion in sales worldwide and represented five of the top 10 selling therapeutics.*\n* The business model enables diversified revenue long-term stream\n   * *Three pronged revenue stream: research, milestone payments, royalties.*\n   * *Revenue to stabilize as therapeutics are approved and come to market (e.g. LY-CoV555)*\n* COVID upside\n   * *Bamlanivimab (Eli Lilly collaboration, LY-CoV555) approved for treatment by Health Canada and the FDA*\n   * *Royalties and future milestone payments to drive near-term revenue growth*\n\nThe Risks:\n\n* **Headline Risk:** milestone payments and earnings are dependent on unknown, binary outcomes (excluding royalties).\n   * Timing and quantum of LY-Cov555 royalties are unknown, delays or other negative developments would limit near-term upside\n   * Lack of transparency - disclosure of partnerships is at the mercy of AbCellera\u2019s customers, with little to no control over public disclosure from partners.\n* **Customer Risk:** AbCellera\u2019s revenue stream relies on its partnerships as if it cannot maintain and expand current partnerships or failure to address the needs of customers could impact the market acceptance of the platform. \n   * As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera had 94 discovery programs that were either completed, in progress or under contract, including 71 with the potential for milestone and royalty payments.\n* **Lack of traction:** Abcellera relies on their technology and partners\u2019 ability to advance a product into clinical development and medical use. Since the launch of their partnership program in 2015, Abcellera has only 1 program lead to clinical milestone payments. If investors are to put a premium on their valuation, Abcellera will need to show rapid adoption of their technology within the industry and successful delivery of therapies to the population. \n   * We expect larger, high profile antibody discoveries (through the use of Abcellera\u2019s technology) to receive higher coverage and perhaps prompt drug makers to disclose Abcellera\u2019s involvement.  \n\nhttps://seeking alpha.com/instablog/52796529-breakwater-research/5525083-pre-ipo-everything-you-need-to-know-abcellera-part-i", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 958951, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "AbCellera's (ABCL) IPO: Everything You Need to Know about the Peter Thiel-backed, AI-powered, COVID-treatment approved, Biotech Company", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ka7m5b/abcelleras_abcl_ipo_everything_you_need_to_know/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1607567581.0}], [[], false, "onemananswerfactory", null, [], null, "text", "t2_nfhmc", false, false, [], false, false, 1607349758, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k8h54v/woof_anyone_looking_at_petco_about_to_ipo/", {}, "k8h54v", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, false, 12, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/k8h54v/woof_anyone_looking_at_petco_about_to_ipo/", false, "self", {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "JqDYO_HiGGthk2y9SyTQQDGcBGWEtAuB66Su2RhYmW8", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BfD2yYKtifdbBETFpfMjP7j12NUzrIeHWLID0EQdZLM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=130a47d0de8cfdb45d06878a376f5f64fb000bfe", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BfD2yYKtifdbBETFpfMjP7j12NUzrIeHWLID0EQdZLM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b0c7449b08dff870ff5cea4c763a6cd4558837b", "width": 216}, {"height": 168, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BfD2yYKtifdbBETFpfMjP7j12NUzrIeHWLID0EQdZLM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc4378030dbafc908dab8cafc78a0937ccf32a11", "width": 320}, {"height": 336, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BfD2yYKtifdbBETFpfMjP7j12NUzrIeHWLID0EQdZLM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb0d7ef272db5f3524b30ea7e251400ea0e9ae0a", "width": 640}, {"height": 504, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BfD2yYKtifdbBETFpfMjP7j12NUzrIeHWLID0EQdZLM.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12eb65a50c720b6068d1de2bed7c4b384ecc1509", "width": 960}, {"height": 567, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BfD2yYKtifdbBETFpfMjP7j12NUzrIeHWLID0EQdZLM.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dacfd5049254d367469d4fd5d42172ff05b760a5", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 630, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BfD2yYKtifdbBETFpfMjP7j12NUzrIeHWLID0EQdZLM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=7bcaf770d4ff1e8db0986037056828597db62978", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, 6, 1607349770, 1, "A little cut n' paste from [https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/woof/company/](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/woof/company/):\n\n&gt;Petco is a beloved brand in the U.S. pet care industry with more than 55 years of service to pets and the people who love and care for them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Since our founding in 1965, we have been developing new standards in pet care, delivering comprehensive wellness solutions through our products and services, and creating communities that deepen the pet-parent bond.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Over the last three years, we have transformed the business from a successful traditional retailer to a disruptive, fully-integrated, digital-focused provider of pet health and wellness offerings.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We revamped our leadership team and invested over $300 million to build out leading capabilities across e-commerce and digital, owned brands, data analytics, and a full suite of on-site services including veterinary care.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Our investments have delivered a comprehensive, integrated, and technology-enabled ecosystem of channels and offerings, complemented by a rapid innovation capability that is disrupting the pet market and providing pet parents with a differentiated holistic solution for all their pet care needs.\n\nI just saw them on this list \\~\\~\\~&gt; [https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/calendar/](https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/calendar/)  and I thought it may be something interesting to look into.", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 952255, "public", "self", "WOOF!

So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/2g68hFq) finish about flat for the day, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/cr8CXVz) finished about half a percent down for the day and the [DOW INDUSTRIAL](https://ibb.co/9tFCX3j) was the biggest losers down almost 1% thought all 3 of them were down even bigger intraday. So, both the SP and the DOW finished with record monthly gains, the SP finish up 10,9% for the month above the previous record of 10,2% exactly 40 years ago, while the DOW finished up 11,9% and topped the previous record from 1987 with the Nasdaq also having its best month since the middle of the dot-com boom in 2001. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/4g07SHm) also finished down more than 1% for the day though at one point it almost hit the 23 mark.\n\nAlmost 70% of companies were declining yesterday on above average volume, as I believe investors were taking profits after the big gains from this huge November rally that we had. [CHART](https://ibb.co/0XvY72g)\n\nEnergy was the biggest loser yesterday as the whole [sectors](https://ibb.co/JBTt3Bt) finished down more than 5% while the only 2 sectors in the green were Technology and Health Care as we saw [value plays](https://ibb.co/SBGP6jS) struggling through the day while large cap growth companies were gaining, led by Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/xf7mqtc), which finished the day up over 2% while the whole financial and energy sectors were down big.\n\nHere are the biggest economic [data](https://ibb.co/yV5rQ23) that we are expecting today, as we will see numbers from the MARKIT PMI and the ISM INDEX with vehicle sales arriving later in the day. Also only one big company is expected to report earnings today, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/YTK19Tr), which is also expected to close a deal today to buy Slack in a cash-only deal. Salesforce is expected to maintain its EPS flat year over year with revenues increasing by more than 16%. I fully expect this to be beaten as this company has gone under appreciated in my opinion as smaller cloud companies have seen the bulk of the stock market gains. If they manage to buy Slack that will be a very positive thing for the company\u2019s future as they will move on to bring a new challenge to the Microsoft bundle. [SLACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/GRjM1wk)\n\nGreat news came in the early morning today, as the OECD [revised](https://ibb.co/mc2dhhd) it\u2019s GDP contraction up 0,3% with a real GDP growth forecasted at over 4% next year and 3,7% in 2022 as China is expected to account for one-third of the world economic growth next year, it might be the time to get more into that part of the stock market as they are expected to have a GDP growth of 8% next year.\n\nAlso, despite dropping more than 3% yesterday, Tesla saw it\u2019s shares bounce back after the [news](https://ibb.co/hdMz1px) that it will be added at full float-adjusted market cap all at once on Dec. 21 due to its ability to accommodate big trades. With other good news coming yesterday also as China finally [approved](https://ibb.co/6n8hzP7) the selling of the Model Y in the country.\n\nAlso relating to the EV world, NIO just [announced](https://ibb.co/m91nYNp) while writing this post an increase of over 100% in delivery numbers for November to over 5 thousand cars. As they company keeps it over 100% year over year deliveries increase and are expected to continue the accelerations of production capacity to accommodate the bigger order numbers.\n\nWhile the hydrogen power Nikola seen it\u2019s share drop yesterday after a worse than expected [deal](https://ibb.co/1nQ2bb5) with GM, as GM has pulled back from its initial far bigger commitment with Nikola as the 2 companies signed a non-binding memorandum that expires at the end of next year, so things may get even worse for Nikola as they also scrapped plans to build the Nikola Badger electric pickup and will refund order deposits for the truck. This resulted in an over 25% drop in Nikola [shares](https://ibb.co/ZMMj5rY) and I expect this to go even lower, as the former CEO Milton will see about 130 million shares unlocked today and a total unlock of 161 million shares, that is more than the [current free float](https://ibb.co/z8vzVTj) shares available for the company at 117 million. If he decides to sell those, that will crush the stock\u2026 So, I think a 15-16 $ price in the near future is possible even with Milton selling his shares.\n\nGood news for 2 of the biggest 3 companies in the world Apple and Amazon [announced](https://ibb.co/RCwxB2s) that they will team up to offer new cloud computing services for AWS users to be able to create and test apps remotely. This will be a big positive for both companies as Amazon will benefit from more cloud services usage while Apple continues to expand the software and services business.\n\nOther great news came for retailers as Shopify [announced](https://ibb.co/KLD25BH) that sales were up 75% year over year as the Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales are booming, this bolds well for companies like Lowe\u2019s, Home Depot, Amazon and many others.\n\nWhile on the vaccine front, Moderna\u2019s candidate is [expected](https://ibb.co/HB8fdnm) to be review in mid-December. I believe the stock has gone way over it\u2019s head and has passed big players in the pharma industry like Vertex and Regeneron though for Moderna this will be they\u2019re first product to be released to the market, I think this stock is well over-hyped at this price, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s worth more than 100$ in the long-run as more vaccines will become available with far cheaper prices.\n\nThe only big company that reported earnings yesterday was [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/FB33wzw) as they beat expectations by [23 cents](https://ibb.co/GJXzrxj). The stock did fall more than 5% in after-hours trading as I expected as the total number of paying customers was only up 17% quarter over quarter with far bigger increases in free users that created bigger bills and drove the profit margins lower to 66% way below the 72% analysts expected. I believe the company faces a though 2021 year as they will have very difficult comps to take on, but I believe this will remain a winner in the longer run. So I sold out of my position on Zoom before this earnings but I will keep an eye on them, if the price drops below 400$ I would be willing to buy the stock once again.\n\nMeanwhile Biden has announced [his top picks](https://ibb.co/8XrnvpQ) for economic appointments and nominations and I believe this are very friendly picks for the stock market as he has gone with more central liberal picks and hasn\u2019t gone to far to the left.\n\nSo I still believe the stock market is in a bull run for the moment with lot of great catalysts like the [PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION](https://ibb.co/T26q9Fz) being more and more certain, and a very likely split government after the Georgia Senate runoff election. So, with at least 2 vaccines right around the corner and treatments for the illness also getting better by the day, this will lead to a gradual reopening of the economy as less and less industries will suffer and the whole economy will eventually go back to normal. Also, the end of the US-China trade war might be in sight or at least a reduction in the trade tensions between the two biggest economies as Biden is close to taking over the Presidency in the US.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

This resulted in an over 25% drop in Nikola [shares](https://ibb.co/ZMMj5rY) and I expect this to go even lower, as the former CEO Milton will see about 130 million shares unlocked today and a total unlock of 161 million shares, that is more than the [current free float](https://ibb.co/z8vzVTj) shares available for the company at 117 million.

So, with at least 2 vaccines right around the corner and treatments for the illness also getting better by the day, this will lead to a gradual reopening of the economy as less and less industries will suffer and the whole economy will eventually go back to normal. Also, the end of the US-China trade war might be in sight or at least a reduction in the trade tensions between the two biggest economies as Biden is close to taking over the Presidency in the US.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

So, with at least 2 vaccines right around the corner and treatments for the illness also getting better by the day, this will lead to a gradual reopening of the economy as less and less industries will suffer and the whole economy will eventually go back to normal. Also, the end of the US-China trade war might be in sight or at least a reduction in the trade tensions between the two biggest economies as Biden is close to taking over the Presidency in the US.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

Unity is a platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 2D and 3D content in gaming, and they're expanding to other industries like automobiles, architecture/construction, retail marketing, etc. They IPO'd about 3 months ago, and they're already up over 150%. I was feeling super excited to invest in this company when I suddenly found a pretty shady and hushed-up sexual harassment case against the top management in the company. \n\n**Some quick facts about the company (pretty much just from their S-1):**\n\n* 1.5M MAU\n* **50%+** of ALL mobile games, PC games, and console games are made using Unity\n* 15K new projects made per day\n* 190+ countries have Unity creators\n* Revenues have grown by approx. 40% YoY over the past 2 years, and they aggressively invest into R&amp;D and S&amp;M to support further expansion in gaming and other industries\n* They've made strategic acquisitions (Vivox, deltaDNA, Artomatix, etc.), and all evidence shows signs of really knowing their market and having a clear roadmap. \n\n**The sexual harassment case and employee data monitoring concerns:** \n\nIn 2019, a woman named Anne Evans, who was the former VP of global talent acquisition, filed a lawsuit against Unity involving 10 members of Unity who were not all disclosed in the filing, but the most important of whom was the current CEO, John Riccitiello. \n\nIn the lawsuit (which anyone can find with a quick google search about sexual harassment at Unity), Riccitiello allegedly made several sexual advances over the years she was at the firm. There is one instance where he apparently lures her into his hotel room, and bluntly expresses that he wants to engage in intercourse with her. She manages to find a way out of the situation, and the next day, he pulls her aside to explain that any word of what happened will lead to her career being ruined. \n\nA couple/few years seem to go by, and in February of 2019, Unity sends out a company-wide survey about receiving feedback to improve culture. Anne Evans (and supposedly some other colleagues as well) anonymously report in the survey that they don't feel like they have anyone to go to, to express their concerns. **Here is why:** the Chief People Officer (basically the head of HR) was a woman named Elizabeth Osterman Brown who was and had been romantically involved with Riccitiello. The nature of their relationship before wasn't clear, but we know they're engaged now **because it's disclosed in the S-1 that Unity filed.** There is a \"Separation Agreement\" for the former CPO (Elizabeth Brown), in which Unity was charged a one-time **$13.5M stock-based compensation expense** that seems to have been given to her. It's unclear why she was pushed out of the company, especially before IPO, but Riccitiello and Brown were engaged (as of October of 2020), so I'm not sure it matters.\n\nEvans was approached about her responses to this company-wide survey by two other women who are part of Unity's HR team, Natalie Mulay (Head of Americas Recruiting) and Christine Kerr (Brown's assistant). They knew the contents of the survey results despite the fact that they shouldn't have access to that information. Evans reported that Mulay and Kerr had access to this survey to Brown and an investigation was launched. Mulay was furious, and she threatened to accuse Evans of sexual harassment herself (they had had a brief consensual relationship in 2016). Mulay for some reason quit Unity briefly, but Unity reps convinced her to swiftly come back. Eventually, Mulay did actually file a sexual harassment complaint against Evans, and there was another investigation, in which at the end all charges against Evans were dropped.\n\n**However,** from the investigation, Unity said they were **terminating Evans' employment at Unity because there was evidence she had 'wrongfully accepted gifts' from Mulay years earlier**. Evans was surprised because she knew that Riccitiello had bought Brown a $40,000 watch, a $3M house in Pleasanton, California, and more. Soon after her termination, she sued Unity, and of course, Unity has vehemently denied any wrongdoing. \n\n\\---\n\n**Here's my problem:** Unity ($U) is a great company. They're clearly doing amazing things for gaming, and they will likely do very well. On the other hand, this lawsuit really makes Riccitiello look bad. I think it's incredibly unlikely that there is any outcome of this lawsuit that jeopardizes Unity's chances of success given that the case is headed for forced arbitration. However, morally, this investment feels wrong. I know that in the end it's really a matter of personal morals and decision-making. It's also not at all confirmed that all these allegations are even true, but something in my gut tells me there's something kind of messed up that happened here (I could be totally wrong of course). \n\n**How you can help:** I would just love to hear how you think about these potentially ethically/morally difficult situations when it comes to investing.

Mulay was furious, and she threatened to accuse Evans of sexual harassment herself (they had had a brief consensual relationship in 2016). Mulay for some reason quit Unity briefly, but Unity reps convinced her to swiftly come back. Eventually, Mulay did actually file a sexual harassment complaint against Evans, and there was another investigation, in which at the end all charges against Evans were dropped.\n\n**However,** from the investigation, Unity said they were **terminating Evans' employment at Unity because there was evidence she had 'wrongfully accepted gifts' from Mulay years earlier**. Evans was surprised because she knew that Riccitiello had bought Brown a $40,000 watch, a $3M house in Pleasanton, California, and more. Soon after her termination, she sued Unity, and of course, Unity has vehemently denied any wrongdoing. \n\n\\---\n\n**Here's my problem:** Unity ($U) is a great company. They're clearly doing amazing things for gaming, and they will likely do very well. On the other hand, this lawsuit really makes Riccitiello look bad. I think it's incredibly unlikely that there is any outcome of this lawsuit that jeopardizes Unity's chances of success given that the case is headed for forced arbitration. However, morally, this investment feels wrong. I know that in the end it's really a matter of personal morals and decision-making. It's also not at all confirmed that all these allegations are even true, but something in my gut tells me there's something kind of messed up that happened here (I could be totally wrong of course). \n\n**How you can help:** I would just love to hear how you think about these potentially ethically/morally difficult situations when it comes to investing. I know many people think ethics/morals have no place in the world of investing, but I'm really curious to hear how other people thing about these things.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 933208, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Should you invest in a company where the CEO has a sexual harassment case active against him, but it seems obvious the company will do well?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k2ovit/should_you_invest_in_a_company_where_the_ceo_has/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1606571448.0}], [[], false, "swinery", null, [], null, "text", "t2_rhkfo", false, false, [], false, false, 1606517043, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k2becv/joe_bidens_administration_could_end_up_developing/", {}, "k2becv", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 22, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/k2becv/joe_bidens_administration_could_end_up_developing/", false, "self", {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "NNGIrwd9WRbJaGnRgEzJ8EPBlvCbnOKQfXAwzK5uKic", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/MR4GJ5NOvjVjd2QVm_48Qs2UQhLvkvkwoqrT4A1E3do.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3e7bbef51884dda226d2b359f4f1b64071800f3", "width": 108}, {"height": 112, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/MR4GJ5NOvjVjd2QVm_48Qs2UQhLvkvkwoqrT4A1E3do.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bde97a6050fa59606a824b618c72c1ea438777d4", "width": 216}, {"height": 167, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/MR4GJ5NOvjVjd2QVm_48Qs2UQhLvkvkwoqrT4A1E3do.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2e9039e08d5af3530efa941614a5831aaf26673", "width": 320}, {"height": 334, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/MR4GJ5NOvjVjd2QVm_48Qs2UQhLvkvkwoqrT4A1E3do.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bddc684362f28988e1cb239283911ac91d43000a", "width": 640}, {"height": 501, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/MR4GJ5NOvjVjd2QVm_48Qs2UQhLvkvkwoqrT4A1E3do.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=615967f41228d49fff5fe0f0d94037d9dc6b18e2", "width": 960}, {"height": 564, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/MR4GJ5NOvjVjd2QVm_48Qs2UQhLvkvkwoqrT4A1E3do.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00c30180650736a35679bc8418be17d108ac68be", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 836, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/MR4GJ5NOvjVjd2QVm_48Qs2UQhLvkvkwoqrT4A1E3do.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3e7f93a91827f1fb04c65c560988d1c1f01eec00", "width": 1600}, "variants": {}}]}, 6, 1606517055, 1, "I've recently been interested in passenger rail potentially becoming a much bigger industry in the coming decades, as North American governments and municipalities are starting to wake up to it's potential.

Roblox RBLX acknowledged in its official paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it is experiencing a huge boost from users isolated during shelter-in-place policies related to coronavirus, but seeks to appeal to a wider, and older, audience to continue growing when things go back to \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nRoblox originally filed for an IPO on Nov. 19, after disclosing a month before that it was beginning the process. Roblox said in the original filing that it sought to raise up to $1 billion; this figure is typically a placeholder that will be updated in later filings, but suggests a larger fundraising goal than the typical large IPO, which uses a $100 million target.\n\nRoblox expects to trade under the ticker \u201cRBLX\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange. There are six banks underwriting the deal, led by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and J.P. Morgan. 2020 has been a good year for IPOs with the Renaissance IPO ETF IPO up 94% for the year to date, compared with a 12% gain in the S&amp;P 500 index SPX , and a 35% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP .\n\nHere are five things to know about Roblox as it becomes a public company.\n\n1. If you don\u2019t have tweens, you\u2019ve probably never heard of it\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of Roblox, you probably haven\u2019t been around a pre-teen much in recent years. The company said that more than half of its 31.1 million daily users are younger than 13 years old. Back in 2018, the service claimed about 12 million daily users.\n\nSince most online accounts require users to be at least 13, the company has faced criticism for inappropriate content on its service. In the prospectus, Roblox said it uses a human review team to screen content and has reviewed more than 68 million \u201cassets\u201d in the first nine months, and has \u201chad a human respond\u201d to more than 9 million customer inquiries within 10 minutes on average. The company hopes to appeal to older users and to retain current users as they grow up.\n\n\u201cWe ultimately aim to be a brand that serves all ages,\u201d the company said in its SEC filing. \u201cAn early sign of what is possible: our 17 to 24-year-old user age group grew faster than our core under 13 age group in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u201d\n\n2. COVID-19 generated a huge boost of traffic\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, Roblox growth exploded as tweens and others who were sheltering in place flocked to the online community. The number of daily users surged 82% over the past 12 months and the average user was on the service for more than two-and-a-half hours a day.\n\n\u201cWe have experienced rapid growth \u2026 given our users have been online more as a result of global COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies,\u201d the company said.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2020, Roblox said DAUs, or daily average users, grew to 31.1 million from 17.1 million in the same period during 2019. Year-over-year, Roblox reported 17.6 million DAUs in 2019, compared with 12 million in 2018.\n\nSimilarly, total hours spent on Roblox more than doubled to 22.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with 10 billion in the same period in 2019. Year-over-year, users spent 13.7 billion hours on Roblox in 2019, versus 9.4 billion in 2018.\n\n3. Its revenue is derived from the model that has Epic Games fighting Apple\n\nRoblox makes money by using a virtual currency called \u201cRobux\u201d that users buy to upgrade avatar and make purchases, but that developers also use within the platform. That means Roblox pays a lot of money to third-party distributors like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. at a time when those practices are being disputed by others.\n\nBack in August, the popular videogame \u201cFortnite,\u201d made by Epic Games, was banned from Apple\u2019s AAPL App Store and Alphabet\u2019s GOOG GOOGL Google Play stores because Epic tried to work around the 30% cuts the companies were getting from in-game purchases, and loudly disputed the practice.\n\nRoblox said it also pays 30% of its one-time purchases to both Apple and Google when they are made on the respective stores. The company said for the first nine months of 2020, 34% of its revenue came from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases. That\u2019s compared with 30% of revenue from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases in 2019.\n\nThe company said its bookings surged 171% to $1.24 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with $458 million in the same period in 2019. From 2018 to 2019, bookings grew 39%. If defines bookings as \u201csales of our virtual currency which we record as deferred revenue and then recognize that revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user.\u201d\n\nBooking per DAU rose to $39.93 in the first nine months of 2020 from $26.75 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIn a nod to COVID-19\u2019s part in the surge, the company said: \u201cWe do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline.\u201d\n\n4. As revenue has soared, losses have widened\n\nWhile Roblox reported a 68% surge in revenue for the first nine months of 2020, losses for the period more than quadrupled.\n\nRoblox reported revenue of $588.7 million and a loss of $203.2 million in the period, compared with $349.9 million in revenue and a loss of $46.3 million for the first nine months of 2019. Roblox reported revenue of$488.2 million and a narrower loss of $86 million in 2019, compared with revenue of $312.8 million and a loss of $97.2 million in 2018.\n\nThe biggest culprits in 2020\u2019s widening loss were payments to content developers and administration fees connected with the run up to the IPO.\n\n\u201cDeveloper exchange fees track closely with our overall bookings performance as more users on the platform and Robux purchased by our users drives more Robux earned by developers and creators,\u201d the company said in its filing.\n\nThose fees soared 190% to $209.2 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared with the same period a year ago.\n\nIn the same period, general and administrative fees soared 125% to $64.9 million. While $27.7 million of that increase was due to higher personnel costs including stock-based compensation expenses, the company also cited \u201can increase in headcount in our finance, accounting, people, IT and legal functions associated with our anticipated public offering.\u201d\n\n5. Early investors get a big upper hand\n\nThe IPO is for Class A shares, which get one vote per share, as opposed to Class B shares that get 20 votes per share and are convertible to Class A shares.\n\nThose Class B shares belong mostly to early investors, the first of which were Altos Ventures and First Round Capital. Altos has a 23.9% stake in the company with 114.3 million shares and First Round has a 7% stake with 33.6 million shares.\n\nLater investors include Meritech Capital Partners and Index Ventures. Meritech owns an 11.6% stake at 55.3 million shares, while Index has an 11.1% stake at 53.1 million shares.\n\nTiger Global Management, which entered the picture in 2018, has an 8.2% stake at 39.3 million shares.\n\nEarlier in the year, Andreessen Horowitz led a $150 million investment round in the company but doesn\u2019t even break into the list of \u201cgreater than 5%\u201d stockholders. \n\n[Source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/roblox-ipo-5-things-to-know-about-the-tween-centric-gaming-platform-11606499231)", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 931861, "public", "self", "Roblox IPO: 5 things to know about the tween-centric gaming platform", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k286yz/roblox_ipo_5_things_to_know_about_the/", "all_ads", 6, 1606502790.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Brothanogood", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_d29iz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606506390, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k286yz/roblox_ipo_5_things_to_know_about_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k286yz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "news", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "866eb162-65e6-11e5-a903-1252b640afe9", "link_flair_text": "News", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 62, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/k286yz/roblox_ipo_5_things_to_know_about_the/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "tpIMnlKEYIYYx2yRVynuo1qbcZxnAK9Myre0GAWUGi4", "resolutions": [{"height": 54, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ba8c59d74e8ff6e92f6ac36181a0b05bec1d4a3", "width": 108}, {"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11dd624a0f2c6cf9001ea1c3cabafd71efedc018", "width": 216}, {"height": 160, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bac411c45daeb5adf984022b95fa39bf4cdf3721", "width": 320}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cc34167a5424a2b3dd89482d4d374b73a1b2e67", "width": 640}, {"height": 480, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c75ba6b59a03006dd5447e0a903e54b185e86562", "width": 960}, {"height": 540, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1116b460b4deec6c16b600251673f6bef66a9536", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 640, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/BMXYIjS40vFQQoAkCaWHN8whvpP7PbL9sxJq_KDJ1oE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b4b2253c418f739208498d73d43dd9966967519d", "width": 1280}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1606506401, "score": 1, "selftext": "Roblox Corp. is planning an initial public offering amid strong momentum as millions of tweens and teenagers are glued to their mobile devices during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe San Mateo, Calif.-based gaming platform features a variety of \u201c3-D digital worlds\u201d that are built by users and developers, providing virtual communities where users can play with friends. Roblox RBLX acknowledged in its official paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it is experiencing a huge boost from users isolated during shelter-in-place policies related to coronavirus, but seeks to appeal to a wider, and older, audience to continue growing when things go back to \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nRoblox originally filed for an IPO on Nov. 19, after disclosing a month before that it was beginning the process. Roblox said in the original filing that it sought to raise up to $1 billion; this figure is typically a placeholder that will be updated in later filings, but suggests a larger fundraising goal than the typical large IPO, which uses a $100 million target.\n\nRoblox expects to trade under the ticker \u201cRBLX\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange. There are six banks underwriting the deal, led by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and J.P. Morgan. 2020 has been a good year for IPOs with the Renaissance IPO ETF IPO up 94% for the year to date, compared with a 12% gain in the S&amp;P 500 index SPX , and a 35% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP .\n\nHere are five things to know about Roblox as it becomes a public company.\n\n1. If you don\u2019t have tweens, you\u2019ve probably never heard of it\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of Roblox, you probably haven\u2019t been around a pre-teen much in recent years. The company said that more than half of its 31.1 million daily users are younger than 13 years old. Back in 2018, the service claimed about 12 million daily users.\n\nSince most online accounts require users to be at least 13, the company has faced criticism for inappropriate content on its service. In the prospectus, Roblox said it uses a human review team to screen content and has reviewed more than 68 million \u201cassets\u201d in the first nine months, and has \u201chad a human respond\u201d to more than 9 million customer inquiries within 10 minutes on average. The company hopes to appeal to older users and to retain current users as they grow up.\n\n\u201cWe ultimately aim to be a brand that serves all ages,\u201d the company said in its SEC filing. \u201cAn early sign of what is possible: our 17 to 24-year-old user age group grew faster than our core under 13 age group in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u201d\n\n2. COVID-19 generated a huge boost of traffic\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, Roblox growth exploded as tweens and others who were sheltering in place flocked to the online community. The number of daily users surged 82% over the past 12 months and the average user was on the service for more than two-and-a-half hours a day.\n\n\u201cWe have experienced rapid growth \u2026 given our users have been online more as a result of global COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies,\u201d the company said.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2020, Roblox said DAUs, or daily average users, grew to 31.1 million from 17.1 million in the same period during 2019. Year-over-year, Roblox reported 17.6 million DAUs in 2019, compared with 12 million in 2018.\n\nSimilarly, total hours spent on Roblox more than doubled to 22.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with 10 billion in the same period in 2019. Year-over-year, users spent 13.7 billion hours on Roblox in 2019, versus 9.4 billion in 2018.\n\n3. Its revenue is derived from the model that has Epic Games fighting Apple\n\nRoblox makes money by using a virtual currency called \u201cRobux\u201d that users buy to upgrade avatar and make purchases, but that developers also use within the platform. That means Roblox pays a lot of money to third-party distributors like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. at a time when those practices are being disputed by others.\n\nBack in August, the popular videogame \u201cFortnite,\u201d made by Epic Games, was banned from Apple\u2019s AAPL App Store and Alphabet\u2019s GOOG GOOGL Google Play stores because Epic tried to work around the 30% cuts the companies were getting from in-game purchases, and loudly disputed the practice.\n\nRoblox said it also pays 30% of its one-time purchases to both Apple and Google when they are made on the respective stores. The company said for the first nine months of 2020, 34% of its revenue came from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases. That\u2019s compared with 30% of revenue from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases in 2019.\n\nThe company said its bookings surged 171% to $1.24 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with $458 million in the same period in 2019. From 2018 to 2019, bookings grew 39%. If defines bookings as \u201csales of our virtual currency which we record as deferred revenue and then recognize that revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user.\u201d\n\nBooking per DAU rose to $39.93 in the first nine months of 2020 from $26.75 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIn a nod to COVID-19\u2019s part in the surge, the company said: \u201cWe do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline.\u201d\n\n4. As revenue has soared, losses have widened\n\nWhile Roblox reported a 68% surge in revenue for the first nine months of 2020, losses for the period more than quadrupled.\n\nRoblox reported revenue of $588.7 million and a loss of $203.2 million in the period, compared with $349.9 million in revenue and a loss of $46.3 million for the first nine months of 2019. Roblox reported revenue of$488.2 million and a narrower loss of $86 million in 2019, compared with revenue of $312.8 million and a loss of $97.2 million in 2018.\n\nThe biggest culprits in 2020\u2019s widening loss were payments to content developers and administration fees connected with the run up to the IPO.\n\n\u201cDeveloper exchange fees track closely with our overall bookings performance as more users on the platform and Robux purchased by our users drives more Robux earned by developers and creators,\u201d the company said in its filing.\n\nThose fees soared 190% to $209.2 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared with the same period a year ago.\n\nIn the same period, general and administrative fees soared 125% to $64.9 million. While $27.7 million of that increase was due to higher personnel costs including stock-based compensation expenses, the company also cited \u201can increase in headcount in our finance, accounting, people, IT and legal functions associated with our anticipated public offering.\u201d\n\n5. Early investors get a big upper hand\n\nThe IPO is for Class A shares, which get one vote per share, as opposed to Class B shares that get 20 votes per share and are convertible to Class A shares.\n\nThose Class B shares belong mostly to early investors, the first of which were Altos Ventures and First Round Capital. Altos has a 23.9% stake in the company with 114.3 million shares and First Round has a 7% stake with 33.6 million shares.\n\nLater investors include Meritech Capital Partners and Index Ventures. Meritech owns an 11.6% stake at 55.3 million shares, while Index has an 11.1% stake at 53.1 million shares.\n\nTiger Global Management, which entered the picture in 2018, has an 8.2% stake at 39.3 million shares.\n\nEarlier in the year, Andreessen Horowitz led a $150 million investment round in the company but doesn\u2019t even break into the list of \u201cgreater than 5%\u201d stockholders. \n\n[Source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/roblox-ipo-5-things-to-know-about-the-tween-centric-gaming-platform-11606499231)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 931861, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Roblox IPO: 5 things to know about the tween-centric gaming platform", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k286yz/roblox_ipo_5_things_to_know_about_the/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1606502790.0}], [[], false, "rhetorical_twix", null, [], null, "text", "t2_8xwbj", false, false, [], false, false, 1606487325, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k2221v/tsla_the_most_valuable_car_company_in_the_world/", {}, "k2221v", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "tickernews", [], "5a4c814a-65e6-11e5-b65e-122ab0778f8b", "Ticker News", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 28, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/k2221v/tsla_the_most_valuable_car_company_in_the_world/", false, "self", {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "uuaz7FLFwQ-azJiOBbkdqfUr5tnzkk2h8ZT8PsFmNuo", "resolutions": [{"height": 75, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Xtz1H-dEtsjx2Xv0wrdxgEdbavDeh_oQxpSYtzz4lzo.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecd81347e5a8978dd9abd3134f4c8bd9886ee65f", "width": 108}, {"height": 151, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Xtz1H-dEtsjx2Xv0wrdxgEdbavDeh_oQxpSYtzz4lzo.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f45a4eea2b8561705b6416373c628ea9109e7b9", "width": 216}, {"height": 223, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Xtz1H-dEtsjx2Xv0wrdxgEdbavDeh_oQxpSYtzz4lzo.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=003899a0025b0a1b2b88cb8db2c9bcd687c29256", "width": 320}, {"height": 447, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Xtz1H-dEtsjx2Xv0wrdxgEdbavDeh_oQxpSYtzz4lzo.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49f037dd0bf99988300f620e4660c145a1cc938c", "width": 640}, {"height": 671, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Xtz1H-dEtsjx2Xv0wrdxgEdbavDeh_oQxpSYtzz4lzo.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e85bf6e7132b55fb2f6f20ad0d5394dfd7736e4", "width": 960}, {"height": 755, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Xtz1H-dEtsjx2Xv0wrdxgEdbavDeh_oQxpSYtzz4lzo.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cd1e26750354870b3c021b6bd45a3b6840dc5ba", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 839, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Xtz1H-dEtsjx2Xv0wrdxgEdbavDeh_oQxpSYtzz4lzo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=4ccd6b72cc09739de2f27c1190eca09da1484ddf", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, 6, 1606487335, 1, "A cosmetic design feature and quality control in construction flaws can lead to steering control mechanisms coming apart while driving. \n\nTesla is known for its production quality issues and is currently ranked the second worst car for quality in some rankings.

Founded in 2016 by former Tesla engineer **Spencer Gore**, the company unveiled its US-1 aircraft in 2018, unique for its long endurance and US origin. The company is backed by Bessemer Venture Partners, Eclipse Venture, and Airbus Ventures.\"\n\n Our Mission\n\n\"We are committed to serving the needs of government agencies, first responders, private security providers, and those working to keep our critical infrastructure working at full potential.\n\nOur team consists of experts in aviation, engineering, advanced imaging and law enforcement and come from some of the most progressive companies in the US including SpaceX, Tesla, NASA, FLIR Systems and Icon Aircraft.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCEO and Founder Spencer Gore has an impressive resume:\n\n* Forbes 30 Under 30 \n* Tesla Battery Designer\n* NASA Astrophysics Directorate\n* Space X Falcon 9\n\nHe has also surrounded himself with a team of former Tesla, Space X, Boeing, FLIR employees to aid him in his expansion.\n\n[https://impossible.aero/about/](https://impossible.aero/about/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been reading up on comments from UAV pilots, drone racing officials, first responders etc. and it's apparent the primary issue with drones is the limited battery life.  Only having an average of 20-30 minute battery life eliminates a wide range of efficient uses for this new technology. IA (Impossible Aerospace) has a drone that can fly for 70-75 minutes...DOUBLE or TRIPLE what competitors can do.  Their drones also use FLIR thermal scanning which can be extremely beneficial for..\n\n* fire departments (28,000 in the US): think wildfire prevention as well as assessing buildings at different levels\n* police departments (18,000 in the US): assessing potentially dangerous situations before officers ever arrive.\n   * It's estimated that a mere 70 of these policing counties can afford to have a helicopter.  The use of drone and thermal imaging could replicate the benefits of a helicopter at a fraction of the price.\n* military: obvious applications\n\nThey recently completed a $1.5 million dollar deal with the US Army as well.  The CEO of Alpine says he is very confident in this experiment of drone usage to procure future contracts.\n\n[https://stockdaymedia.com/alpine-4-technologies-ltd-alpp-and-impossible-aerospace-corporation-ia-announce-that-ia-has-completed-the-final-milestone-of-their-1-5-million-us-air-force-contract/](https://stockdaymedia.com/alpine-4-technologies-ltd-alpp-and-impossible-aerospace-corporation-ia-announce-that-ia-has-completed-the-final-milestone-of-their-1-5-million-us-air-force-contract/)\n\nThere has also been a lot of talk about foreign made drone models/equipment being a threat to national security so a US made drone is of highest priority to the military.  If they see an effective use for these drones we could see them expanded across other branches and used more widely $$$$.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFunding:\n\nThey've secured funding from two notable names in my opinion.\n\n1. Bessemer Venture Partners (known for being early investors in LinkedIn, Pinterest, Shopify, Docusign, Skype etc.)\n2. Airbus Ventures (venture arm of Airbus)\n\n[https://www.cbinsights.com/company/impossible-aerospace-corp-funding](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/impossible-aerospace-corp-funding)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother interesting thing to look at on another tab at the link above...is the patents.  They have 2 patents pending which appear to really lock down the whole \"build from the battery\" concept that IA has developed.  If they're able to safeguard this technology it could be huge for future growth.\n\nMOVING FORWARD:\n\nThe company is moving in the direction of commercial drone usage as well.  If they're able to retain their competitive edge on flight time and payload, they will be a clear cut choice for the likes of Amazon of other e-commerce platforms to deliver packages from warehouse to doorstep.\n\nI'm having trouble finding the link right now but I've read they recently gained approval to construct buildings and operate in 7 other US states.  I'm not entirely positive what this means but I'm sure the expansion is good.\n\nEventually Spencer Gore aims to create passenger electric planes which I know is definitely far in the future...but I feel that if anyone can get it done, it's this team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, there's my first real DD post...don't tear me up too bad but let me know your thoughts/comments/concerns.

The company is backed by Bessemer Venture Partners, Eclipse Venture, and Airbus Ventures.\"\n\n Our Mission\n\n\"We are committed to serving the needs of government agencies, first responders, private security providers, and those working to keep our critical infrastructure working at full potential.\n\nOur team consists of experts in aviation, engineering, advanced imaging and law enforcement and come from some of the most progressive companies in the US including SpaceX, Tesla, NASA, FLIR Systems and Icon Aircraft.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCEO and Founder Spencer Gore has an impressive resume:\n\n* Forbes 30 Under 30 \n* Tesla Battery Designer\n* NASA Astrophysics Directorate\n* Space X Falcon 9\n\nHe has also surrounded himself with a team of former Tesla, Space X, Boeing, FLIR employees to aid him in his expansion.\n\n[https://impossible.aero/about/](https://impossible.aero/about/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been reading up on comments from UAV pilots, drone racing officials, first responders etc. and it's apparent the primary issue with drones is the limited battery life.  Only having an average of 20-30 minute battery life eliminates a wide range of efficient uses for this new technology. IA (Impossible Aerospace) has a drone that can fly for 70-75 minutes...DOUBLE or TRIPLE what competitors can do.  Their drones also use FLIR thermal scanning which can be extremely beneficial for..\n\n* fire departments (28,000 in the US): think wildfire prevention as well as assessing buildings at different levels\n* police departments (18,000 in the US): assessing potentially dangerous situations before officers ever arrive.\n   * It's estimated that a mere 70 of these policing counties can afford to have a helicopter.  The use of drone and thermal imaging could replicate the benefits of a helicopter at a fraction of the price.\n* military: obvious applications\n\nThey recently completed a $1.5 million dollar deal with the US Army as well.  The CEO of Alpine says he is very confident in this experiment of drone usage to procure future contracts.\n\n[https://stockdaymedia.com/alpine-4-technologies-ltd-alpp-and-impossible-aerospace-corporation-ia-announce-that-ia-has-completed-the-final-milestone-of-their-1-5-million-us-air-force-contract/](https://stockdaymedia.com/alpine-4-technologies-ltd-alpp-and-impossible-aerospace-corporation-ia-announce-that-ia-has-completed-the-final-milestone-of-their-1-5-million-us-air-force-contract/)\n\nThere has also been a lot of talk about foreign made drone models/equipment being a threat to national security so a US made drone is of highest priority to the military.  If they see an effective use for these drones we could see them expanded across other branches and used more widely $$$$.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFunding:\n\nThey've secured funding from two notable names in my opinion.\n\n1. Bessemer Venture Partners (known for being early investors in LinkedIn, Pinterest, Shopify, Docusign, Skype etc.)\n2. Airbus Ventures (venture arm of Airbus)\n\n[https://www.cbinsights.com/company/impossible-aerospace-corp-funding](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/impossible-aerospace-corp-funding)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother interesting thing to look at on another tab at the link above...is the patents.  They have 2 patents pending which appear to really lock down the whole \"build from the battery\" concept that IA has developed.  If they're able to safeguard this technology it could be huge for future growth.\n\nMOVING FORWARD:\n\nThe company is moving in the direction of commercial drone usage as well.  If they're able to retain their competitive edge on flight time and payload, they will be a clear cut choice for the likes of Amazon of other e-commerce platforms to deliver packages from warehouse to doorstep.\n\nI'm having trouble finding the link right now but I've read they recently gained approval to construct buildings and operate in 7 other US states.  I'm not entirely positive what this means but I'm sure the expansion is good.\n\nEventually Spencer Gore aims to create passenger electric planes which I know is definitely far in the future...but I feel that if anyone can get it done, it's this team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, there's my first real DD post...don't tear me up too bad but let me know your thoughts/comments/concerns.

Let\u2019s discuss this and more**\n\nHey everyone and Welcome , so let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 big indexes drop with the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/r63grbk) being down 0,42%, finishing the week up 0,2%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9whHcdZ) down 0,68% and finishing 0,8% down for the week while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/9V3z9jd) lost 3 quarters of a percent as this was also the same percentage that it dropped for the week. The VIX went up 2,5% but finished the week flat as it has for the past couple of weeks after the election. There was about an even split of companies advancing to declining as the volume continues to drop. Though there was a sharp sell-off in the last 30minutes to end the trading week as I believe a lot of people don\u2019t want to hold the money in the stock market over the weekend as cases of the illness rise in the US. [CHART](https://ibb.co/8gb1Csf) / [VIX](https://ibb.co/WsNMvGv)\n\nHere is the heat map from yesterday and the heat map for the whole week and it\u2019s obvious that this was a pretty much mixed week as financials and energy sectors have recovered a little bit of the ground they lost during the last 8 months of recovery while the leaders of the recovery, the big tech struggled a little this week. [FRIDAY](https://ibb.co/r7QFV0m) / [WEEK](https://ibb.co/9VWyGGH)\n\nNext week is pretty low on interesting earnings though I think I am going to try and buy some small pieces for companies like Best Buy, GAP and Hormel as I believe they may have some upside potential, I also think Dick\u2019s sporting goods will do good but I think the expectations are a little high for that company and despite meeting the analyst expectations the retail investors might jump off the bandwagon and the stock may suffer. [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/56yWLs9)\n\nAlso, important economic data will only come until Wednesday as the stock market and economic data take a break for Thanksgiving. The most important numbers coming are the MARKIT PMI\u2019s, the consumer confidence index and a lot of critical data that comes in on Wednesday as you can see here [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/ZKHM2cD).\n\nThe worst performing sectors on Friday were financials, industrials and surprisingly technology also, while the only real bright spot were communication services. [CHART](https://ibb.co/Df47v43)\n\nSome great news for online retailers came in as the first week of November saw a more than 80% increase in online shopping traffic with 20% less traffic around malls vs last year but an almost 60% increase since March. The rise of e-commerce is still expected to continue big in the next years as analysts expect sales to grow between 25 and 35%. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/YfWJJ4W) / [NEWS](https://ibb.co/KWFF2Dy) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/9wmFS0w)\n\nMoving on, two of the biggest giants in the tech sector and in the whole world, Apple and Microsoft also announced that they will team up to create a controller supported for IOS devices as the gaming industry has seen a huge spike and is expected to have huge growth in the coming years while Microsoft also seems to be targeting Zoom as they are removing the 40minute limit starting on Thanksgiving and are offering free all-day video calling via the TEAMS app. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/0mwb9KR)\n\nJust take care and don\u2019t rush into winners just because they are up huge this year, look at companies that have potential just like DraftKings and Penn Gaming, as the companies have huge tailwind especially legalized gambling in more and more states with a growing online presence and sports expected to have big returns in the next years.

I still believe this is a great company as they and Disney will be the two biggest players in the streaming business in my opinion in the long run while ROKU also seems to be benefiting a lot from the dying of traditional TV as they are hitting all-time highs both in value for the company and subscribers.

Let\u2019s discuss this and more**\n\nHey everyone and Welcome , so let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 big indexes drop with the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/r63grbk) being down 0,42%, finishing the week up 0,2%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9whHcdZ) down 0,68% and finishing 0,8% down for the week while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/9V3z9jd) lost 3 quarters of a percent as this was also the same percentage that it dropped for the week. The VIX went up 2,5% but finished the week flat as it has for the past couple of weeks after the election. There was about an even split of companies advancing to declining as the volume continues to drop. Though there was a sharp sell-off in the last 30minutes to end the trading week as I believe a lot of people don\u2019t want to hold the money in the stock market over the weekend as cases of the illness rise in the US. [CHART](https://ibb.co/8gb1Csf) / [VIX](https://ibb.co/WsNMvGv)\n\nHere is the heat map from yesterday and the heat map for the whole week and it\u2019s obvious that this was a pretty much mixed week as financials and energy sectors have recovered a little bit of the ground they lost during the last 8 months of recovery while the leaders of the recovery, the big tech struggled a little this week. [FRIDAY](https://ibb.co/r7QFV0m) / [WEEK](https://ibb.co/9VWyGGH)\n\nNext week is pretty low on interesting earnings though I think I am going to try and buy some small pieces for companies like Best Buy, GAP and Hormel as I believe they may have some upside potential, I also think Dick\u2019s sporting goods will do good but I think the expectations are a little high for that company and despite meeting the analyst expectations the retail investors might jump off the bandwagon and the stock may suffer. [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/56yWLs9)\n\nAlso, important economic data will only come until Wednesday as the stock market and economic data take a break for Thanksgiving. The most important numbers coming are the MARKIT PMI\u2019s, the consumer confidence index and a lot of critical data that comes in on Wednesday as you can see here [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/ZKHM2cD).\n\nThe worst performing sectors on Friday were financials, industrials and surprisingly technology also, while the only real bright spot were communication services. [CHART](https://ibb.co/Df47v43)\n\nSome great news for online retailers came in as the first week of November saw a more than 80% increase in online shopping traffic with 20% less traffic around malls vs last year but an almost 60% increase since March. The rise of e-commerce is still expected to continue big in the next years as analysts expect sales to grow between 25 and 35%. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/YfWJJ4W) / [NEWS](https://ibb.co/KWFF2Dy) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/9wmFS0w)\n\nMoving on, two of the biggest giants in the tech sector and in the whole world, Apple and Microsoft also announced that they will team up to create a controller supported for IOS devices as the gaming industry has seen a huge spike and is expected to have huge growth in the coming years while Microsoft also seems to be targeting Zoom as they are removing the 40minute limit starting on Thanksgiving and are offering free all-day video calling via the TEAMS app. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/0mwb9KR)\n\nJust take care and don\u2019t rush into winners just because they are up huge this year, look at companies that have potential just like DraftKings and Penn Gaming, as the companies have huge tailwind especially legalized gambling in more and more states with a growing online presence and sports expected to have big returns in the next years.

I put this post together to outline a major technology trend (bottoms-up sales) and to analyse some potential investment opportunities to go along with this trend.\n\n# Bottom-Up Software Sales\n\nThe \"bottom up\" go-to-market strategy is the main sales strategy used by some of the world's fastest growing enterprise software companies, from Atlassian to Zoom.\n\nThe premise behind the bottom-up strategy is simple. Instead of taking a top-down approach, where software is sold directly to company leaders (CEO, CTO etc), bottom-up software can be adopted by individuals or small teams at a company before expanding to being used company-wide.\n\nFor example, Zoom is often initially adopted by individual salespeople to run a remote sales call before being eventually adopted company-wide to run all company meetings.\n\nThere are huge opportunities for public investors who can understand and identify companies that are successfully using the bottom-up strategy. In this post, I'll explain the benefits of a bottom-up strategy and list some exciting public companies using this strategy to their advantage.\n\n# What's so special about bottom-up?\n\nThere are a number of distinct advantages to the bottom-up strategy that makes for incredible businesses and investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Lower cost of customer acquisition (CAC).** Traditional top-down software companies such as Oracle and SAP spend a massive amount of money on sales. They need to since they are selling to C-level executives and their products typically cost millions to implement. Bottom-up businesses don't have this problem. Users can sign up to their products directly from the website in minutes. Therefore they spend far less money on sales and can acquire customers for far less.\n* **More money for R&amp;D.** Since bottom-up companies don't need to employ a large sales force, they can spend more of their revenue on research and development. They can either focus on improving their current product offering or building brand new products.  \n   * This creates a really powerful flywheel effect. Less money spent on sales = more money for R&amp;D = a better and faster improving product = more customers = less money spent on sales....\n* **More chances to be adopted.** Top-down companies only really get one or two chances to sell to a customer. If the CEO doesn't like your sales pitch, there's not much you can do. Bottom-up companies have hundreds of chances to be adopted since they can be adopted by individual employees or small teams.\n* **You can sell down-market.** Many of the best SaaS (software as a service) products are used by both startups and large companies due to their bottom-up strategy. This allows them to access a larger total addressable market, generate revenue early, get quicker feedback and to also grow revenue naturally as their customers grow in size. Top-down companies typically don't sell down-market due to the high sales costs involved for them.\n\n## What to look for in a bottom-up company\n\nNot all bottom-up companies are created equal. Here are some important things to look out for when evaluating investment opportunities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Look for a \"receptive\" market.** The bottom-up strategy is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The approach just doesn't make sense for some products and markets. E.G. Payroll software needs to be adopted company-wide for it to be effective. Whereas project management software can be easily adopted by individuals or small teams. This is a receptive market.\n* **World-class design.** Bottom-up companies can only be successful if their products can be easily adopted and used by individual users. To provide value quickly, these products need to be intuitive, simple and a joy to use. Look for products that fit this description. If you are unsure on how to evaluate design quality, go to websites such as G2 and read customer reviews.\n* **Growing average revenue per customer.** Bottom-up products are easily adopted by individual employees. However, the real test of a bottoms-up product is whether or not it spreads within each customer and starts to generate more and more revenue. Look for companies where this is happening. If a bottom-up company is only growing through new customer acquisition then this is a bad sign. Their product is not being widely adopted at each customer.\n* **High sales efficiency ratio.** In the same vein as the advantage of having a low CAC, high quality bottom-up companies should have high sales efficiency ratios as they need to employee fewer salespeople than top-down companies.\n* **Moving up-market.** While the ability to sell down-market is a big advantage, you should be wary of companies that only sell down-market. Look for companies that sell to both Fortune 500 companies and startups.\n\n## Bottom-Up Companies\n\nBelow are some bottom-up companies that are, in my opinion, great investment opportunities. (Please note, that this is not investment advice and just the companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio). Please note, I currently personally hold a position in Slack, but not Asana (yet).\n\n### Asana ($ASAN):\n\nAsana is a project management software company that IPO'd in late September. It is the archetypical bottom-up company; individual users/teams adopt Asana to run their own projects before it is eventually adopted company-wide as the go-to project management tool.\n\nI like Asana for a couple of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Asana's sales efficiency is 1.15.** This is a very healthy number for a newly public company and shows that their bottom-up strategy is working very well.\n2. **R&amp;D spend is 64% of revenue.** While this may seem incredibly high to some and could be a negative sign at a more mature company, as explained above bottom-up companies live and die on the quality of their product. A high % spend on R&amp;D shows that Asana's management clearly understand where their money can create the most long-term shareholder value.\n3. **Product &amp; design quality.** This is an entirely personal opinion but I've used Asana extensively and it's the best-designed project management tool I've ever used.\n4. **YoY revenue growth of 85%.** Even though Asana is a relatively young company, revenue growth of 85% is incredibly impressive.\n\n### Slack ($WORK) :\n\nSlack is a business chat/communications tool for companies. Colleagues can send DMs to each other, create channels (chat rooms), private groups and more. It is becoming the de-facto internal communication channel for many of the world's fastest growing companies.\n\nI like Slack for a couple of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Product stickiness.** Once Slack is adopted company-wide it is incredibly hard to replace. The deep customisation allowed (different channels, private groups etc) and the amount of stored knowledge in the system means that many companies would almost grind to a halt if they could not use it. They would not be able to effectively communicate. This is in contrast to a tool like Zoom, which could be fairly easily replaced if better video conferencing software was available.\n2. **Average user activity is 90 minutes per day.** The average slack user spends 90 minutes every day on the platform. This is an incredible example of the value that slack is providing to it's users and is indicative of a bottom-up product that is getting adopted company-wide.\n3. **65 of the Fortune 100 use Slack.** As mentioned above, a critical measure of a bottom-up company is whether or not they can move up-market. Slack is being used by some of the world's fastest growing public companies. It is also used by Amazon, which at the time of writing is the 3rd largest company (by market cap) in the world.\n\n### Honourable Mentions:\n\nBelow are some more bottom-up companies that are definitely worth investigating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Zoom ($ZM)\n2. Atlassian ($TEAM)\n3. Datadog ($DDOG)\n4. Zendesk ($ZEN)\n5. Hubspot ($HUBS)\n6. Docusign ($DOCU)\n\nPlease let me know if you've found this post valuable.

They run their scanners when they are looking for investment opportunities and then when they find a PE of 5 they think they found the holy grail.Here are a few things that the PE won\u2019t tell you\n\nWorst of all :  \n*\u201cProfits are an opinion, Cash is a fact\u201d - Alfred Rappaport*\n\n**Are Profits really Profits?**  \nBasically the management team has a lot of room to manipulate Earnings. It\u2019s actually possible to be \u201cprofitable\u201d but cash is flowing out of the company year after year. The \u201cProfits\u201d could be very misleading. Always compare the cashflows with the net profits they claim to make!\n\n**The Company could have a lot of debt and it\u2019s possible they can\u2019t manage it!**  \nThe Price earnings ratio is based on Market cap and does not include the debt. Always look at the Enterprise Value to see the real price of a Company!\u00a0\n\n**Sales and Earnings could be declining**  \nA really bad scenario would be if a company keeps making less money year after year. Within a few years a low PE would turn into a high PE ( assuming the price is constant). This is not a scenario that you want and it would turn a cheap stock into a quite expensive stock\n\n**There was a one off event**  \nA one off Event is an event that occurs once and then it won\u2019t repeat. Profits could\u2019ve been higher last year because the Company sold an asset. It depends how they book it BUT it\u2019s likely that it will distort the Price earnings ratio for that period. Even worse. If they sold parts of their company they will likely earn less money in the future.

They run their scanners when they are looking for investment opportunities and then when they find a PE of 5 they think they found the holy grail.Here are a few things that the PE won\u2019t tell you\n\nWorst of all :  \n*\u201cProfits are an opinion, Cash is a fact\u201d - Alfred Rappaport*\n\n**Are Profits really Profits?**  \nBasically the management team has a lot of room to manipulate Earnings. It\u2019s actually possible to be \u201cprofitable\u201d but cash is flowing out of the company year after year. The \u201cProfits\u201d could be very misleading. Always compare the cashflows with the net profits they claim to make!\n\n**The Company could have a lot of debt and it\u2019s possible they can\u2019t manage it!**  \nThe Price earnings ratio is based on Market cap and does not include the debt. Always look at the Enterprise Value to see the real price of a Company!\u00a0\n\n**Sales and Earnings could be declining**  \nA really bad scenario would be if a company keeps making less money year after year. Within a few years a low PE would turn into a high PE ( assuming the price is constant). This is not a scenario that you want and it would turn a cheap stock into a quite expensive stock\n\n**There was a one off event**  \nA one off Event is an event that occurs once and then it won\u2019t repeat. Profits could\u2019ve been higher last year because the Company sold an asset. It depends how they book it BUT it\u2019s likely that it will distort the Price earnings ratio for that period. Even worse. If they sold parts of their company they will likely earn less money in the future. Once again this is not a scenario that you want!\n\n**The Company could face expensive lawsuits**  \nAnother thing the PE doesn\u2019t tell you is that the company might face huge fines in the near future. Did they put the money aside already ? If not it can hurt earnings\n\n**The company could have declining Margins**  \nAnother thing the Price Earnings Ratio won\u2019t tell you are if Margins are declining. This could be because of new competition etc. Once again a bad scenario that will turn a low PE into a high PE stock over some time\n\nCan you think of other reasons why the PE could be misleading?

There\u2019s still a lot of upside to this stock, I\u2019m sure. I have to admit I was a little surprised to see the downtrend/flatlining from June - November which was not at all as volatile as March to June. I\u2019d expected it to keep on being quite volatile.

I\u2019ve closely been checking reviews on Google for various Nordstrom and Rack stores and they are usually very good. People tend to post photos, too - on Google reviews and on Twitter, and generally their stores seem to have been buzzing. Maybe not as busy as pre-Covid but definitely not deserted as the dirt cheap stock price will have you believe. \n\nTo me the future of JWN has to do mostly with whether you believe customers will continue to shop at department stores like Nordstrom, Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s or if these will lose a huge chunk of their customer base to online stores like Amazon etc. \n\nPersonally I believe once this virus disappears or people get immunity by vaccine, gradually we will go back to pre-Covid shopping routines. Sure, some will have been introduced to online shopping and stick with it but I think most people already knew about online shopping prior to Covid and I think the people that used to go to department stores will do that again. Online shopping isn\u2019t a new thing. So why would people go to department stores a year ago if online shopping is better? Convenience is a relative matter.

Buying a suit, a dress or a pair of jeans is different. Zalando (big European apparel e-commerce site) recently announced that about half of the products they sell are returned. Half! That\u2019s crazy. \n\nI\u2019ve not mentioned all the things that make Nordstrom stand out between itself and its competition. First, keep in mind a lot of the competition has gone bankrupt. JCPenney, Neiman Marcus, Lord &amp; Taylor.. the list goes on. Second, Nordstrom has so much going for it when it comes to adapting to a changing retail landscape. Less full line stores, more racks and locals. Expansion of curbside pickup. More things added to the shopping experience.. look it up yourself, there\u2019s a lot of clever stuff. \n\nAnyway, I didn\u2019t mean to make such a long post but I thank you if you want to share your thoughts on this stock.

That\u2019s crazy. \n\nI\u2019ve not mentioned all the things that make Nordstrom stand out between itself and its competition. First, keep in mind a lot of the competition has gone bankrupt. JCPenney, Neiman Marcus, Lord &amp; Taylor.. the list goes on. Second, Nordstrom has so much going for it when it comes to adapting to a changing retail landscape. Less full line stores, more racks and locals. Expansion of curbside pickup. More things added to the shopping experience.. look it up yourself, there\u2019s a lot of clever stuff. \n\nAnyway, I didn\u2019t mean to make such a long post but I thank you if you want to share your thoughts on this stock.

(NYSE: PLTR) reported its financial results today for the third quarter of 2020.\n\n**Summary**\n\n* $289.4 million in revenue in the third quarter, up 52% year-over-year\n* Full-year 2020 revenue guidance raised to a range of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion, up 44% year-over-year\n* New contracts in third quarter include U.S. Army ($91 million), National Institutes of Health ($36 million), and $300 million renewal with aerospace customer\n\nHere are the financial statements: [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/HYCzVWZ)\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n*Overview*\n\nOur growth and momentum across the business have continued.\n\nWe generated $289.4 million in revenue in the third quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 52% from the third quarter of 2019, when we generated $190.5 million in revenue.\n\nThe demand for our software has increased steadily over the past year in the face of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the United States and abroad.\n\nWe are increasing our guidance for our full-year revenue in 2020 to a range of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion, which would represent a growth rate of 44% over the prior year, when we generated $743 million in revenue.\n\n*Financial Results*\n\nOur operating results have continued to show significant improvement.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we generated revenue of $289.4 million, up 52% year-over-year, which is approximately $9 million above the high end of our prior guidance range.\n\nWe incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.\n\nOur income from operations was $73.1 million when adjusting for $847.0 million in stock-based compensation, $20.2 million in related employer payroll taxes, and $53.7 million in expenses related to the listing.\n\nThe demand for our software from customers in both the commercial and government sectors has continued to increase this year.\n\nIn the three months ended September 30, 2020, we closed fifteen deals with new and existing customers, each worth $5 million or more in total contract value, including contracts with the U.S. Army and National Institutes of Health, as well as a contract renewal with one of the world\u2019s largest aerospace companies worth $300 million in total contract value over five years.\n\nThe average revenue generated per customer through the first nine months of 2020 was $5.8 million, up from $4.2 million per customer, or 38%, from the same period the year before.\n\nOur customer concentration is decreasing. In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, revenue from our top twenty customers constituted 61% of our total revenue for the period, down from 68% in the first nine months of 2019.\n\nWe continue to have significant cash reserves. As of September 30, 2020, we had a total of cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion.\n\n*Government*\n\nThe U.S. government sector remains a primary area of focus for our business.\n\nOur work with healthcare organizations across the federal government has accelerated this year, and we continue to expand our reach with the nation\u2019s defense and intelligence agencies, including the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n\nIn September 2020, we were selected among 999 bids for a two-year, $91 million contract with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory to provide artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities for military planning and defense operations.\n\nOur work with partners across the U.S. federal government in responding to the coronavirus pandemic has increased significantly in recent months.\n\nWe were selected in September 2020 by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), a federal research organization based in Bethesda, Maryland, and operating under the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), for a $36 million contract to provide our software to the agency for cancer and coronavirus research.\n\nOur software is now being used for coronavirus response and research efforts by the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a program run under the NIH that maintains the largest clinical data asset in the world regarding the development of the coronavirus. As part of the research effort, our software was used to integrate clinical data from more than one million patients in the United States in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe company\u2019s efforts to assist foreign governments in their response to the coronavirus continues in countries around the world.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, for example, our software has been used by the National Health Service to allocate and distribute more than 2.7 billion items of personal protective equipment across the country.\n\n*Commercial*\n\nWe are continuing to see significant momentum in our business across the commercial sector this year, both in the United States and abroad.\n\nIn September 2020, we closed a five-year contract renewal with a customer in the aerospace industry that is worth $300 million in total contract value, representing our largest ever contract in the commercial sector.\n\nThe lead time for customers to begin using our software has fallen sharply this year, and organizations continue to expand access to our platforms to users across their operations.\n\nAn oil and gas customer, one of the largest energy companies in the world, identified a new opportunity to use our software to save costs in connection with oil exploration activities and generated $57 million in cash savings within weeks of starting to use our platform.\n\nThe energy company identified an additional $315 million in cost savings opportunities using our software, and the company\u2019s management is currently targeting $1 billion in total savings in the coming year through the use of our platform.\n\nOur software has also been used widely by customers across industries, including the automotive, manufacturing, aviation, healthcare, and banking sectors, to adjust their operations in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nA major consumer goods company in the United States recently turned to Palantir after an investment of more than one hundred million dollars in another enterprise software platform failed to produce results.\n\nThe customer began using our software within days to help address disruptions to its supply chain as a result of the pandemic. The company has since expanded its use of the platform to identify cost savings in raw material purchases across its business.\n\n*International Expansion*\n\nOur expansion in a number of markets abroad continues, including in Japan.\n\nIn June 2020, we selected Sompo Holdings, Inc., the Tokyo-based insurance company and Japan\u2019s leading nursing care provider, as our strategic partner. The company is currently one of our most significant shareholders, following its approximately $500 million investment in Palantir this year.\n\n\u201cSompo\u2019s work is vital to Japan\u2019s welfare and security, and Kengo Sakurada, the company\u2019s group chief executive officer, has been a critical and trusted partner as we work with Sompo to expand our reach in Asia,\u201d said Alexander C. Karp, co-founder and chief executive officer of Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWe believe that our market opportunity in Japan and the broader region will be significant over the long term.\n\nOur expansion in Asia builds on our already significant presence outside North America, including in Europe, the Middle East, and increasingly South America.\n\n*Financial Outlook*\n\nWe are increasing our revenue guidance for this year and now expect the business to generate a total of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion in annual revenue in 2020, up 44% year-over-year.\n\nOur annual adjusted operating income in 2020 is expected to be $130 million to $136 million, which excludes stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and expenses primarily related to our direct listing.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect revenue of $299 million to $301 million, up 30% to 31% from last year, when we generated $229 million in revenue.\n\nOur adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2020 is expected to be $44 million to $50 million, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes.\n\nWe continue to expect that year-over-year revenue growth in 2021 will be greater than 30%.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release and the accompanying tables contain the non-GAAP financial measure income (loss) from operations, excluding stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and expenses primarily related to the direct listing.\n\nWe believe this non-GAAP financial measure helps us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting Palantir\u2019s business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We exclude stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, from this non-GAAP financial measure because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. Additionally, we exclude expenses primarily related to the direct listing, as they are a one-time nonrecurring charge and employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation as it is difficult to predict and outside of the control of the Company. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish this or similar metrics. Further, this metric has certain limitations, as it does not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measure income (loss) from operations, excluding stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and expenses primarily related to the direct listing should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n\nA reconciliation table of the most comparable GAAP financial measure to the non-GAAP financial measure used in this press release are included with the financial tables at the end of this release. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items that may be incurred in the future such as stock-based compensation, and related employer payroll taxes, the effect of which may be significant.", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 906272, "public", "self", "Palantir Reports Revenue Growth of 52% in the Third Quarter, Raises Full-Year 2020 Guidance", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jt3b14/palantir_reports_revenue_growth_of_52_in_the/", "all_ads", 6, 1605211806.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "0toHeroInvesting", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8oq1j048", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605215406, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jt3b14/palantir_reports_revenue_growth_of_52_in_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jt3b14", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 52, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/jt3b14/palantir_reports_revenue_growth_of_52_in_the/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "r_gV0i_eR3RIWaNZ460yVgKv48B3p_tU3eoVw_TAXew", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/rSiA9v7N7Sr-3v4OHcEo8FRnNzGQeH-W3xpatwldu9E.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc73df4840bfa20d38d2c3ce16046f260eba1c46", "width": 108}, {"height": 112, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/rSiA9v7N7Sr-3v4OHcEo8FRnNzGQeH-W3xpatwldu9E.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34ef5796f25fb3c01a9ecd0283a32bb98e410eb2", "width": 216}, {"height": 167, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/rSiA9v7N7Sr-3v4OHcEo8FRnNzGQeH-W3xpatwldu9E.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a89a3998f00fe7d14279bd3860a0a53b8dfd07a", "width": 320}, {"height": 334, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/rSiA9v7N7Sr-3v4OHcEo8FRnNzGQeH-W3xpatwldu9E.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cce084bea90d973c19ef029ac7c14e4cbd359fa8", "width": 640}, {"height": 501, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/rSiA9v7N7Sr-3v4OHcEo8FRnNzGQeH-W3xpatwldu9E.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=325f6440318384142478f25b687eb8cb27a3e8e4", "width": 960}, {"height": 563, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/rSiA9v7N7Sr-3v4OHcEo8FRnNzGQeH-W3xpatwldu9E.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a13464d50a1d7079829fefe731fc13b293f8635", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 643, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/rSiA9v7N7Sr-3v4OHcEo8FRnNzGQeH-W3xpatwldu9E.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=981119803e96251826f37a26b67dd5917e740afc", "width": 1232}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1605215417, "score": 1, "selftext": " \n\n*New Contracts with U.S. Army and National Institutes of Health;*\n\n*$300 Million Renewal with Aerospace Customer Announced*\n\nDENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR) reported its financial results today for the third quarter of 2020.\n\n**Summary**\n\n* $289.4 million in revenue in the third quarter, up 52% year-over-year\n* Full-year 2020 revenue guidance raised to a range of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion, up 44% year-over-year\n* New contracts in third quarter include U.S. Army ($91 million), National Institutes of Health ($36 million), and $300 million renewal with aerospace customer\n\nHere are the financial statements: [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/HYCzVWZ)\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n*Overview*\n\nOur growth and momentum across the business have continued.\n\nWe generated $289.4 million in revenue in the third quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 52% from the third quarter of 2019, when we generated $190.5 million in revenue.\n\nThe demand for our software has increased steadily over the past year in the face of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the United States and abroad.\n\nWe are increasing our guidance for our full-year revenue in 2020 to a range of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion, which would represent a growth rate of 44% over the prior year, when we generated $743 million in revenue.\n\n*Financial Results*\n\nOur operating results have continued to show significant improvement.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we generated revenue of $289.4 million, up 52% year-over-year, which is approximately $9 million above the high end of our prior guidance range.\n\nWe incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.\n\nOur income from operations was $73.1 million when adjusting for $847.0 million in stock-based compensation, $20.2 million in related employer payroll taxes, and $53.7 million in expenses related to the listing.\n\nThe demand for our software from customers in both the commercial and government sectors has continued to increase this year.\n\nIn the three months ended September 30, 2020, we closed fifteen deals with new and existing customers, each worth $5 million or more in total contract value, including contracts with the U.S. Army and National Institutes of Health, as well as a contract renewal with one of the world\u2019s largest aerospace companies worth $300 million in total contract value over five years.\n\nThe average revenue generated per customer through the first nine months of 2020 was $5.8 million, up from $4.2 million per customer, or 38%, from the same period the year before.\n\nOur customer concentration is decreasing. In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, revenue from our top twenty customers constituted 61% of our total revenue for the period, down from 68% in the first nine months of 2019.\n\nWe continue to have significant cash reserves. As of September 30, 2020, we had a total of cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion.\n\n*Government*\n\nThe U.S. government sector remains a primary area of focus for our business.\n\nOur work with healthcare organizations across the federal government has accelerated this year, and we continue to expand our reach with the nation\u2019s defense and intelligence agencies, including the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n\nIn September 2020, we were selected among 999 bids for a two-year, $91 million contract with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory to provide artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities for military planning and defense operations.\n\nOur work with partners across the U.S. federal government in responding to the coronavirus pandemic has increased significantly in recent months.\n\nWe were selected in September 2020 by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), a federal research organization based in Bethesda, Maryland, and operating under the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), for a $36 million contract to provide our software to the agency for cancer and coronavirus research.\n\nOur software is now being used for coronavirus response and research efforts by the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a program run under the NIH that maintains the largest clinical data asset in the world regarding the development of the coronavirus. As part of the research effort, our software was used to integrate clinical data from more than one million patients in the United States in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe company\u2019s efforts to assist foreign governments in their response to the coronavirus continues in countries around the world.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, for example, our software has been used by the National Health Service to allocate and distribute more than 2.7 billion items of personal protective equipment across the country.\n\n*Commercial*\n\nWe are continuing to see significant momentum in our business across the commercial sector this year, both in the United States and abroad.\n\nIn September 2020, we closed a five-year contract renewal with a customer in the aerospace industry that is worth $300 million in total contract value, representing our largest ever contract in the commercial sector.\n\nThe lead time for customers to begin using our software has fallen sharply this year, and organizations continue to expand access to our platforms to users across their operations.\n\nAn oil and gas customer, one of the largest energy companies in the world, identified a new opportunity to use our software to save costs in connection with oil exploration activities and generated $57 million in cash savings within weeks of starting to use our platform.\n\nThe energy company identified an additional $315 million in cost savings opportunities using our software, and the company\u2019s management is currently targeting $1 billion in total savings in the coming year through the use of our platform.\n\nOur software has also been used widely by customers across industries, including the automotive, manufacturing, aviation, healthcare, and banking sectors, to adjust their operations in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nA major consumer goods company in the United States recently turned to Palantir after an investment of more than one hundred million dollars in another enterprise software platform failed to produce results.\n\nThe customer began using our software within days to help address disruptions to its supply chain as a result of the pandemic. The company has since expanded its use of the platform to identify cost savings in raw material purchases across its business.\n\n*International Expansion*\n\nOur expansion in a number of markets abroad continues, including in Japan.\n\nIn June 2020, we selected Sompo Holdings, Inc., the Tokyo-based insurance company and Japan\u2019s leading nursing care provider, as our strategic partner.

Noted significant increase in rate of case identification in the last week, and as a result, it expects first interim analysis will include substantially more than 53 cases - the targeted trigger point for the analysis ([FT](https://www.ft.com/content/c6c6b704-964a-4df6-8330-8e3290ea65fa)). Around 30K trial participants given either vaccine or a placebo, and 53 people had now tested positive for Covid-19. Independent data monitoring board will now compare infections in placebo group with vaccinated participants, to examine vaccine's effectiveness. Dr. Fauci speculated Moderna's vaccine would display a similar degree of efficacy as Pfizer's (PFE-US ) candidate, which demonstrated 90% efficacy and is based on comparable technology.\n\n**Path of least resistance for stocks remains higher:**\n\n* Stocks remain underpinned by several factors, including some more recent developments. Vaccine optimism, which has been part of the bullish narrative for a while, has ratcheted up further in the wake of the Pfizer news. According to the [Good Judgment Project](https://goodjudgment.io/superforecasts/#1420), the probability that a vaccine will be widely distributed by the end of March now stands at 88%, up nearly 40 points in just the last week. Removal of election overhang another key driver, particularly with the likelihood of a split Congress leaving market-friendly tax and regulatory policies largely in place. Central bank liquidity tailwind still seen as the most influential upside driver. In addition, there appears to be some additional monetary policy accommodation and targeted fiscal stimulus in the pipeline. Resilient corporate profit backdrop also in focus with S&amp;P 500 earnings in 2021 now expected to grow 22%+ and exceed 2019 by 3%+.\n\n**Growth sectors reversed some of the week's underperformance:**\n\n* **Tech** and **consumer discretionary** led the market with the FAANGs higher. Software, semis, housing retailers, quick-serve restaurants were among better groups. Defensives outperformed, with HPCs, discount retailers among the **consumer staples** leaders. **Communication services** underperformed with FAANG components better, but DIS-US , telecoms a drag. **Healthcare** trailed on weakness in hospitals, distributors. **Financials** were lower with credit cards, regional banks, life insurers among weakest groups. **Industrials** saw declines across airlines, A&amp;D, machinery. **Energy** underperformed after seeing big gains to start the week. Services, IOs among weaker groups. **Materials** sector was the worst performer with precious metals miners, commodity chemicals weaker.\n\n**Rotation sustainability a big question for the market:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-11/wall-street-jumps-on-value-train-amid-record-global-rotation?sref=L75TRUmI) discussed how some Wall Street strategists think there may be more room to run when it comes to the latest rotation out of growth and momentum factors and into value and cyclical plays. However, it also pointed out that previous rotations have quickly fizzled and some are wary about giving up on growth, which is expected to remain a beneficiary of secular growth and disruption forces. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-value-options/options-buyers-shift-to-u-s-value-stocks-on-vaccine-hopes-idUSKBN27Q321) noted that after big buying sprees in tech earlier this year, options investors are now focused on small-caps and other economically sensitive companies, including travel and leisure names. Highlighted the potential for further upside in value and cyclicals as individual investors pile in amid a fear of missing out. However, also pointed out that activity has not reached the frenzied levels seen around tech names this year amid some skepticism about the sustainability of the rotations.\n\n**States tightening coronavirus restrictions as hospitalizations, deaths continue to rise:**\n\n* New York cases hit 4,820 today, highest since April, while positive rate of 2.93% just below 3% threshold that would force schools to shut down again.

[NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/health/covid-indoor-venues-infections.html) noted a new analysis that found that restaurants, gyms, cafes and other crowded indoor venues accounted for some 8 in 10 new infections in the early months of the US coronavirus outbreak. The new restrictions in the US have not been anywhere near as aggressive as what has been seen lately in a number of European countries and there is no appetite for the draconian lockdowns put in place in March and April.  \n\n\n**ECB's Lagarde signals more policy support coming:**\n\n* ECB President Lagarde delivered a dovish [speech](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2020/html/ecb.sp201111~d01e03eb9c.en.html) at the central bank's Sintra conference. Despite the progress on the vaccine front, she cautioned on recurring cycles of accelerating virus spread and restrictions until widespread immunity is achieved. She highlighted the need for continued policy support to achieve inflation aim and deliver financing conditions necessary to support economy. She suggested that additional accommodation, which is widely expected in December, will come via the PEPP and TLTROs (and not rate cuts). The Street seems to be looking for a \\~\u20ac500B increase to QE. Sell-side takeaways also discussed how Lagarde hinted at the need for cooperation between monetary and fiscal policy.

Workfront, based in Lehi, Utah, will take its 3,000 corporate customers and 1 million users to the software maker best known for Photoshop. Bloomberg earlier reported that the acquisition could come as soon as Monday.\n\nAdobe has been a leader in the graphics and visual software industry for decades, but hasn\u2019t offered collaboration tools. The company\u2019s shares, which have climbed 43% this year, declined 4.8% to $471.14 at the close in New York.\n\nAfter recent stumbles, the acquisition is Adobe\u2019s biggest effort to reorient its Experience Cloud division, which includes marketing, advertising and analytics software, toward areas that are growing. The company has sought to make its creative and business applications more collaborative, so that teams can more easily work together on projects. During the Covid-19 pandemic, businesses have found it essential to have better communication among colleagues working remotely. Adobe has curtailed some of its advertising services that had a low profit margin and said it had a new strategy of catering to customers that use multiple Experience Cloud tools.\n\nUnlike other makers of work productivity tools, including Asana Inc. and Atlassian Inc., which owns Trello, Workfront is focused on marketers, who use the software every day to \u201cmanage content, plan and track marketing campaigns and execute complex workflows across teams,\u201d Adobe said in the statement. Marketers are also major clients for Adobe, which already integrates several of its products with Workfront\u2019s offering.\n\nWorkfront will be Adobe\u2019s fifth-biggest acquisition, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe purchase marks the first major action by Anil Chakravarthy, an executive vice president, who joined Adobe in January after serving as chief executive officer of Informatica LLC. Chakravarthy said in an interview that Adobe and Workfront have more than 1,000 mutual clients.\n\n\u201cEvery customer that we talk to is investing more and more in digital marketing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to get more efficiency out of digital marketing efforts. They want to get more agility and speed into their digital marketing efforts. As the investments grow the amount of work involved in marketing, is growing exponentially and they really need a system to be able to manage work so they get the right efficiency, productivity and collaboration across their teams.\u201d\n\nWorkfront has seen interest in its software increase during the pandemic as marketing companies seek to get more insight into which employees are working on what part of a project, Alex Shootman, Workfront\u2019s chief executive officer, said in an interview. The Adobe acquisition, he said, is an \u201cawesome outcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you have an opportunity to work with the company that CMOs rely on to run their business, which is Adobe, and you\u2019re a company like Workfront, that takes us forward years in terms of what we would have been able to accomplish on our own,\u201d Shootman said.\n\nShootman will continue to run the Workfront team and will report to Chakravarthy when the acquisition is completed.\n\nWorkfront has raised about $100 million to date, according to PitchBook.

Workfront, based in Lehi, Utah, will take its 3,000 corporate customers and 1 million users to the software maker best known for Photoshop. Bloomberg earlier reported that the acquisition could come as soon as Monday.\n\nAdobe has been a leader in the graphics and visual software industry for decades, but hasn\u2019t offered collaboration tools. The company\u2019s shares, which have climbed 43% this year, declined 4.8% to $471.14 at the close in New York.\n\nAfter recent stumbles, the acquisition is Adobe\u2019s biggest effort to reorient its Experience Cloud division, which includes marketing, advertising and analytics software, toward areas that are growing. The company has sought to make its creative and business applications more collaborative, so that teams can more easily work together on projects. During the Covid-19 pandemic, businesses have found it essential to have better communication among colleagues working remotely. Adobe has curtailed some of its advertising services that had a low profit margin and said it had a new strategy of catering to customers that use multiple Experience Cloud tools.\n\nUnlike other makers of work productivity tools, including Asana Inc. and Atlassian Inc., which owns Trello, Workfront is focused on marketers, who use the software every day to \u201cmanage content, plan and track marketing campaigns and execute complex workflows across teams,\u201d Adobe said in the statement. Marketers are also major clients for Adobe, which already integrates several of its products with Workfront\u2019s offering.\n\nWorkfront will be Adobe\u2019s fifth-biggest acquisition, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe purchase marks the first major action by Anil Chakravarthy, an executive vice president, who joined Adobe in January after serving as chief executive officer of Informatica LLC. Chakravarthy said in an interview that Adobe and Workfront have more than 1,000 mutual clients.\n\n\u201cEvery customer that we talk to is investing more and more in digital marketing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to get more efficiency out of digital marketing efforts. They want to get more agility and speed into their digital marketing efforts. As the investments grow the amount of work involved in marketing, is growing exponentially and they really need a system to be able to manage work so they get the right efficiency, productivity and collaboration across their teams.\u201d\n\nWorkfront has seen interest in its software increase during the pandemic as marketing companies seek to get more insight into which employees are working on what part of a project, Alex Shootman, Workfront\u2019s chief executive officer, said in an interview. The Adobe acquisition, he said, is an \u201cawesome outcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you have an opportunity to work with the company that CMOs rely on to run their business, which is Adobe, and you\u2019re a company like Workfront, that takes us forward years in terms of what we would have been able to accomplish on our own,\u201d Shootman said.\n\nShootman will continue to run the Workfront team and will report to Chakravarthy when the acquisition is completed.\n\nWorkfront has raised about $100 million to date, according to PitchBook.

Came after favorable coronavirus vaccine news, which helped the rotation continue today. A vaccine breakthrough has long been flagged as the most powerful tailwind for a sustained rotation following the longstanding upside leadership of growth and momentum factors. There has also been some focus on positive economic and earnings surprise momentum as drivers, while analysts have highlighted extreme positioning and valuation divergences as well. In addition, while a split Congress has taken the likelihood of meaningful fiscal stimulus off the table, additional support is still coming. While value and cyclicals do face headwinds from worsening coronavirus trends, growth has also seemed to run up against some very elevated expectations, a dynamic evidenced by the lackluster reaction to strong Q3 earnings.\n\n**Growth sectors extend yesterday's historic underperformance:**\n\n* Growth sectors underperformed again. **Tech,** **consumer discretionary and** **communication services** were the only sectors lower with the FAANGs mostly down. Software, semis, restaurants, travel and leisure also among weaker groups. **Healthcare** an outperformer on gains across pharma and distributors, while hospitals mostly extended yesterday's gains. **Financials** ahead with insurers the best group, offsetting weakness across banks, particularly moneycenters. **Materials** led by chemicals. **Industrials** saw broad gains, particularly A&amp;D, rails, and electricals/multis. **Consumer staples** ahead with drug stores, tobacco, beverages among the best groups. **Energy** the best performer WTI higher as IOCs extended Monday's big gains.\n\n**Busy day of Fedspeak:**\n\n* **Dallas' Kaplan** (voter) told [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-10/fed-s-kaplan-says-virus-resurgence-threatens-next-two-quarters?sref=J9GPLx1B) the next two quarters will be difficult, but he sees a strong 2021, expecting 3.5% growth. In [testimony](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/quarles20201110a.htm) to a Senate committee, **Vice Chair for Supervision Quarles** said bank strength remains intact with high liquidity and capital levels, **Boston's Rosengren** (non-voter) said in a [speech](https://www.bostonfed.org/-/media/Documents/Speeches/PDF/20201110-text.pdf) policymakers should watch for imbalances as they emerge, and that excessive risk-taking could prolong economic distress, based on previous cycles. **San Francisco's Daly** (non-voter) told [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/fed-officials-in-robust-discussions-about-the-future-of-their-asset-purchase-program.html) that the Fed is in discussions over what more it can do around asset purchases and how the bank should plan communications around asset purchases moving forward. The Fed is currently purchasing \\~$120B a month in bonds, though many believe it could increase the amount and/or change the composition of purchases, though [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-turns-attention-to-asset-purchases-after-spelling-out-low-rate-pledges-11604226601) noted broad skepticism that strategy would do much given already-low rates.\n\n**McConnell repeats call for limited stimulus package:**\n\n* Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) on Monday called for limited stimulus bill by year-end, in the wake of positive news on a coronavirus vaccine and falling unemployment ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/mcconnell-calls-for-smaller-stimulus-after-pfizer-vaccine-data?srnd=premium-asia&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B)). Also said this afternoon he will be speaking with House Leader Pelosi, though looking for highly targeted deal ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/525364-mcconnell-pushing-for-highly-targeted-covid-relief-deal?__twitter_impression=true)). Other Republican senators warned getting a deal done in the lame duck session will be hard and signaled openness to wrapping a stimulus package into a spending bill needed to avoid a government shutdown on 11-Dec. Elsewhere, [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/stimulus-defense-bill-on-congresss-long-to-do-list-11605032240) noted President-elect Biden expected to play bigger role in stimulus discussion during lame duck to pave path for agreement before he takes office. While Senate Republicans have been focused on a bill worth \\~$500B, House Democrats have insisted it must be in excess of $2T. Odds of a stimulus bill before 2021 further complicated by Trump's refusal to concede and run-off elections in Georgia in early January that could determine control of Senate next year.\n\n**Vaccine breakthrough also brings key unanswered questions, logistical challenges:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/pfizer-vaccine-results-leave-questions-about-safety-longevity?srnd=premium&amp;sref=L75TRUmI) noted that amid all the excitement surrounding news the coronavirus vaccine candidate from Pfizer (PFE-US ) and BioNTech (BNTX-US ) was more than 90% effective in late-stage trials, there are still a number of issues to be sorted out. It highlighted uncertainty over how long the vaccine will confer protection and how many will benefit. Also pointed out the headline number says little about what kind of cases are being prevented. Added that vaccines like Pfizer's must be stored at ultra-cold temperatures. [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-next-big-challenge-after-a-covid-vaccine-is-giving-it-to-enough-people-11604945455?mod=hp_lead_pos1) also discussed the myriad logistical challenges surrounding production and distribution. Pointed out that even at a much better than expected efficacy rate of 90%, at least three-quarters of the population would have to be inoculated to achieve herd immunity and life may not return to normal until 2022.\n\n**Checking in on the bullish narrative:**\n\n* As has been the case for the better part of the last seven or eight months, the biggest tailwind for stocks seems to be the unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response to the coronavirus pandemic, with BofA pegging the combined stimulus at over $21T. Vaccine optimism has also played a meaningful role, with recent news of a near-term breakthrough driving a rotation to value and cyclical plays. At the same time, there are thoughts that growth factors are likely to be protected by favorable secular themes. Resilient corporate earnings, largely a function of operating leverage, have been another widely discussed bright spot. The removal of the election overhang has also helped and the likelihood of a split Congress and no meaningful shift in tax and regulatory policy has overshadowed earlier hopes for more significant coronavirus and infrastructure stimulus.\n\n**Checking on the bearish narrative:**\n\n* While stimulus has been the big driver of the bullish narrative for stocks, there continue to be concerns about depleted monetary policy arsenals and worries central banks are increasingly is pushing on a string. In addition, there is no appetite for meaningful fiscal stimulus in a Republican controlled Senate. Worsening coronavirus trends have been largely overshadowed by vaccine optimism but represent a headwind on growth, even without a return to the draconian lockdown measures seen early on in the pandemic. A rotation out of growth has some broader market implications given the extent to which the S&amp;P 500 is concentrated in big tech. There are also potential risks from the bond market given the massive inflows driven by a reach for yield. While earnings beat rates have been strong, they have benefited from bombed-out expectations and the bar is moving higher.\n\n**Supreme Court signals it is unlikely to strike down Obamacare**\n\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/10/supreme-court-obamacare-kavanaugh-435711), the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/supreme-court-obamacare-aca.html) and other outlets discussed how the Supreme Court on Tuesday signaled that Obamacare would likely survive its third major legal challenge. Noted that at least five justices, including two members of the court's conservative majority, suggested the individual mandate was severable from the rest of the law. Other conservative justices also expressed doubt about whether Congress' decision to scrap the penalty for failing to secure health insurance because it could be no longer be justified as a tax, caused any harm to the plaintiffs. While the case has been widely viewed as weak, there still have been concerns about the fate of Obamacare under the court's enhanced conservative majority. This development has driven the outperformance of managed care (particularly managed Medicare) and hospital stocks.\n\n**Amazon under regulatory scrutiny in Europe:**\n\n* European Commission filed charges against Amazon (AMZN-US ) on Tuesday after it concluded it breached antitrust rules by using third-party sellers' data for its own benefit. EU launched probe into Amazon in June 2019 and WSJ reported in June of this year it was planning formal antitrust challenges. Brussels said today it is also launching a second investigation into Amazon's e-commerce processes. While big tech has come under heightened regulatory scrutiny in both the US and Europe, it has not been much on overhang on equity sentiment as the group has been a big beneficiary of its leverage to secular growth and disruption themes, several aspects of which have been accelerated by the coronavirus. The bigger threat to the group from near-term perspective seems to be a vaccine-driven rotation from these very crowded longs to under-owned value and cyclical plays.\n\n**NextEra rebuffed by Evergy, Lowe's not in talks to acquire HD Supply, Justice Department clears Uber purchase of Postmates:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/evergy-ma-nextera-energy/exclusive-nextera-energy-in-15-billion-bid-for-evergy-sources-idUKL1N2HV2J0) reported that **NextEra** (NEE-US ), the world's largest producer of solar and wind energy, made a \\~$15B all-stock offer to acquire US power utility **Evergy** (EVRG-US ). However, Evergy rejected the offer and it is unclear whether NextEra, which was also recently rebuffed buy Duke Energy (DUK-US ), will make a new approach. **Lowe's** (LOW-US ) said in a [statement](https://www.streetaccount.com/EmailSearchHandler.axd?guid=9a8c0f36-641d-4398-b382-a4e7dacf3827&amp;press_release=true&amp;ticker=HDS&amp;iid=2911999) that it is not in discussions with **HD Supply** (HDS-US ) about a transaction. Followed earlier [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/lowe-s-is-said-to-be-in-talks-to-acquire-hd-supply?sref=L75TRUmI) report that said the companies were discussing a deal. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/doj-clears-uber-postmates-deal-566fed38-2d2a-4a1d-95af-45fd61df57bc.html) cited a source familiar with the deal who said the Justice Department has cleared **Uber**'s (UBER-US ) $2.65B all-stock deal to acquire food delivery company **Postmates**. **Adobe** (ADBE-US ) confirmed agreement to acquire privately held **Workfront**, a work management platform for marketers, for $1.5B.\n\n**Post-election transition slowed by legal challenges:**\n\n* [Axios](https://www.axios.com/bill-barr-voter-fraud-investigations-7bfc378a-35f8-467f-9e74-10aa57c8c7d5.html) noted that President Trump has refused to concede the election to President-elect Biden, reiterating allegations of widespread voter fraud and corruption despite a lack of specific evidence. Added that his claims have been shot down by Democratic and Republican secretaries of state. [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/trump-campaign-s-legal-blitz-isn-t-targeting-enough-votes-to-win?sref=L75TRUmI) also discussed how Trump's legal challenges are unlikely to gain any meaningful traction. However, [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/us/politics/republicans-trump-concede-2020-election.html?campaign_id=4&amp;emc=edit_dk_20201110&amp;instance_id=23967&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;regi_id=33659448&amp;segment_id=44093&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=2b41d3782bf056154514beb0de555f4d) pointed out that leading Republicans have coalesced around Trump's strategy. In addition, the [AP](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-elections-voting-fraud-and-irregularities-4eeb9e0c97301a23ae8d05b54c3144fd) reported Attorney General Barr has authorized US attorneys to investigate alleged voter fraud. [Reuters](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-10/biden-transition-team-calls-on-federal-agency-to-declare-winner?sref=L75TRUmI) said the Biden transition team is considering legal action to force the General Services Administration to designate him the winner so that it can begin accessing federal resources needed to ensure an orderly transfer of power.\n\n**Political fight brewing over whether to extend Fed's emergency facilities:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/business/economy/federal-reserve-emergency-loans.html) discussed how a political fight is brewing over whether to extend the Fed's emergency loan programs, which expire on 31-Dec. Paper said that while the Fed might be inclined to keep the programs in effect, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has signaled he would prefer to end the one that purchases municipal bonds, and has come under heightened pressure from Republicans to allow all five of the Treasury-funded programs to lapse. However, some Democrats had been looking to the municipal program as a backup option if Congress fails to pass additional funds for state and local governments. Paper highlighted some debate about the potential market impact of ending the programs. While they have seen little use, they have been a big part of the powerful Fed signaling effect that quickly helped repair credit markets earlier this year.", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 903694, "public", "self", "Top Market News - Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2020", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jrtkg7/top_market_news_tuesday_nov_10_2020/", "all_ads", 6, 1605038651.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "spacej3di", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_kdm2ull", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605042251, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jrtkg7/top_market_news_tuesday_nov_10_2020/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jrtkg7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "resources", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "a376614c-65e6-11e5-b6e7-123c7cc7e97b", "link_flair_text": "Resources", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/jrtkg7/top_market_news_tuesday_nov_10_2020/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "qF_UkOI8ox0pwPZoWSsvMvixK-4yLjHG0kJL3i4QXQg", "resolutions": [{"height": 72, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/vo7RDplkcBbiOYvhJG3jHb0owasB0Ih6WKI2qIFKc0A.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e16c46014db296724cc6aabb4b7a588ac63ce25c", "width": 108}, {"height": 144, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/vo7RDplkcBbiOYvhJG3jHb0owasB0Ih6WKI2qIFKc0A.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd93dbe007a879fb2739bee7646e654dc5661921", "width": 216}, {"height": 213, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/vo7RDplkcBbiOYvhJG3jHb0owasB0Ih6WKI2qIFKc0A.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1783e6181a9764a78b8b513fdb4ec5441f77cc71", "width": 320}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/vo7RDplkcBbiOYvhJG3jHb0owasB0Ih6WKI2qIFKc0A.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=999952b849e89eb977518856d55a8a329f66c614", "width": 640}, {"height": 640, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/vo7RDplkcBbiOYvhJG3jHb0owasB0Ih6WKI2qIFKc0A.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf6cbcf101069408d76d0de3a693fe629cb978f5", "width": 960}, {"height": 720, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/vo7RDplkcBbiOYvhJG3jHb0owasB0Ih6WKI2qIFKc0A.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9eaf73c31a3d5cf5871e12f066adf8021a6f116e", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 800, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/vo7RDplkcBbiOYvhJG3jHb0owasB0Ih6WKI2qIFKc0A.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=088310ffc6074e8c75be1a6a1b2ece9d803ea615", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1605042263, "score": 1, "selftext": "**Rotation from growth to value continues:**\n\n* Value outperformed growth by another \\~240 bps on Tuesday after Monday's 450 bp gap, which reversed four months of growth outperformance in one session.

Other Republican senators warned getting a deal done in the lame duck session will be hard and signaled openness to wrapping a stimulus package into a spending bill needed to avoid a government shutdown on 11-Dec. Elsewhere, [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/stimulus-defense-bill-on-congresss-long-to-do-list-11605032240) noted President-elect Biden expected to play bigger role in stimulus discussion during lame duck to pave path for agreement before he takes office. While Senate Republicans have been focused on a bill worth \\~$500B, House Democrats have insisted it must be in excess of $2T. Odds of a stimulus bill before 2021 further complicated by Trump's refusal to concede and run-off elections in Georgia in early January that could determine control of Senate next year.\n\n**Vaccine breakthrough also brings key unanswered questions, logistical challenges:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/pfizer-vaccine-results-leave-questions-about-safety-longevity?srnd=premium&amp;sref=L75TRUmI) noted that amid all the excitement surrounding news the coronavirus vaccine candidate from Pfizer (PFE-US ) and BioNTech (BNTX-US ) was more than 90% effective in late-stage trials, there are still a number of issues to be sorted out. It highlighted uncertainty over how long the vaccine will confer protection and how many will benefit. Also pointed out the headline number says little about what kind of cases are being prevented. Added that vaccines like Pfizer's must be stored at ultra-cold temperatures. [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-next-big-challenge-after-a-covid-vaccine-is-giving-it-to-enough-people-11604945455?mod=hp_lead_pos1) also discussed the myriad logistical challenges surrounding production and distribution. Pointed out that even at a much better than expected efficacy rate of 90%, at least three-quarters of the population would have to be inoculated to achieve herd immunity and life may not return to normal until 2022.\n\n**Checking in on the bullish narrative:**\n\n* As has been the case for the better part of the last seven or eight months, the biggest tailwind for stocks seems to be the unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response to the coronavirus pandemic, with BofA pegging the combined stimulus at over $21T. Vaccine optimism has also played a meaningful role, with recent news of a near-term breakthrough driving a rotation to value and cyclical plays. At the same time, there are thoughts that growth factors are likely to be protected by favorable secular themes. Resilient corporate earnings, largely a function of operating leverage, have been another widely discussed bright spot. The removal of the election overhang has also helped and the likelihood of a split Congress and no meaningful shift in tax and regulatory policy has overshadowed earlier hopes for more significant coronavirus and infrastructure stimulus.\n\n**Checking on the bearish narrative:**\n\n* While stimulus has been the big driver of the bullish narrative for stocks, there continue to be concerns about depleted monetary policy arsenals and worries central banks are increasingly is pushing on a string. In addition, there is no appetite for meaningful fiscal stimulus in a Republican controlled Senate. Worsening coronavirus trends have been largely overshadowed by vaccine optimism but represent a headwind on growth, even without a return to the draconian lockdown measures seen early on in the pandemic. A rotation out of growth has some broader market implications given the extent to which the S&amp;P 500 is concentrated in big tech. There are also potential risks from the bond market given the massive inflows driven by a reach for yield. While earnings beat rates have been strong, they have benefited from bombed-out expectations and the bar is moving higher.\n\n**Supreme Court signals it is unlikely to strike down Obamacare**\n\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/10/supreme-court-obamacare-kavanaugh-435711), the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/supreme-court-obamacare-aca.html) and other outlets discussed how the Supreme Court on Tuesday signaled that Obamacare would likely survive its third major legal challenge. Noted that at least five justices, including two members of the court's conservative majority, suggested the individual mandate was severable from the rest of the law. Other conservative justices also expressed doubt about whether Congress' decision to scrap the penalty for failing to secure health insurance because it could be no longer be justified as a tax, caused any harm to the plaintiffs. While the case has been widely viewed as weak, there still have been concerns about the fate of Obamacare under the court's enhanced conservative majority. This development has driven the outperformance of managed care (particularly managed Medicare) and hospital stocks.\n\n**Amazon under regulatory scrutiny in Europe:**\n\n* European Commission filed charges against Amazon (AMZN-US ) on Tuesday after it concluded it breached antitrust rules by using third-party sellers' data for its own benefit. EU launched probe into Amazon in June 2019 and WSJ reported in June of this year it was planning formal antitrust challenges. Brussels said today it is also launching a second investigation into Amazon's e-commerce processes. While big tech has come under heightened regulatory scrutiny in both the US and Europe, it has not been much on overhang on equity sentiment as the group has been a big beneficiary of its leverage to secular growth and disruption themes, several aspects of which have been accelerated by the coronavirus. The bigger threat to the group from near-term perspective seems to be a vaccine-driven rotation from these very crowded longs to under-owned value and cyclical plays.\n\n**NextEra rebuffed by Evergy, Lowe's not in talks to acquire HD Supply, Justice Department clears Uber purchase of Postmates:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/evergy-ma-nextera-energy/exclusive-nextera-energy-in-15-billion-bid-for-evergy-sources-idUKL1N2HV2J0) reported that **NextEra** (NEE-US ), the world's largest producer of solar and wind energy, made a \\~$15B all-stock offer to acquire US power utility **Evergy** (EVRG-US ). However, Evergy rejected the offer and it is unclear whether NextEra, which was also recently rebuffed buy Duke Energy (DUK-US ), will make a new approach. **Lowe's** (LOW-US ) said in a [statement](https://www.streetaccount.com/EmailSearchHandler.axd?guid=9a8c0f36-641d-4398-b382-a4e7dacf3827&amp;press_release=true&amp;ticker=HDS&amp;iid=2911999) that it is not in discussions with **HD Supply** (HDS-US ) about a transaction. Followed earlier [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/lowe-s-is-said-to-be-in-talks-to-acquire-hd-supply?sref=L75TRUmI) report that said the companies were discussing a deal. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/doj-clears-uber-postmates-deal-566fed38-2d2a-4a1d-95af-45fd61df57bc.html) cited a source familiar with the deal who said the Justice Department has cleared **Uber**'s (UBER-US ) $2.65B all-stock deal to acquire food delivery company **Postmates**. **Adobe** (ADBE-US ) confirmed agreement to acquire privately held **Workfront**, a work management platform for marketers, for $1.5B.\n\n**Post-election transition slowed by legal challenges:**\n\n* [Axios](https://www.axios.com/bill-barr-voter-fraud-investigations-7bfc378a-35f8-467f-9e74-10aa57c8c7d5.html) noted that President Trump has refused to concede the election to President-elect Biden, reiterating allegations of widespread voter fraud and corruption despite a lack of specific evidence. Added that his claims have been shot down by Democratic and Republican secretaries of state. [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/trump-campaign-s-legal-blitz-isn-t-targeting-enough-votes-to-win?sref=L75TRUmI) also discussed how Trump's legal challenges are unlikely to gain any meaningful traction. However, [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/us/politics/republicans-trump-concede-2020-election.html?campaign_id=4&amp;emc=edit_dk_20201110&amp;instance_id=23967&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;regi_id=33659448&amp;segment_id=44093&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=2b41d3782bf056154514beb0de555f4d) pointed out that leading Republicans have coalesced around Trump's strategy. In addition, the [AP](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-elections-voting-fraud-and-irregularities-4eeb9e0c97301a23ae8d05b54c3144fd) reported Attorney General Barr has authorized US attorneys to investigate alleged voter fraud. [Reuters](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-10/biden-transition-team-calls-on-federal-agency-to-declare-winner?sref=L75TRUmI) said the Biden transition team is considering legal action to force the General Services Administration to designate him the winner so that it can begin accessing federal resources needed to ensure an orderly transfer of power.\n\n**Political fight brewing over whether to extend Fed's emergency facilities:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/business/economy/federal-reserve-emergency-loans.html) discussed how a political fight is brewing over whether to extend the Fed's emergency loan programs, which expire on 31-Dec. Paper said that while the Fed might be inclined to keep the programs in effect, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has signaled he would prefer to end the one that purchases municipal bonds, and has come under heightened pressure from Republicans to allow all five of the Treasury-funded programs to lapse. However, some Democrats had been looking to the municipal program as a backup option if Congress fails to pass additional funds for state and local governments. Paper highlighted some debate about the potential market impact of ending the programs. While they have seen little use, they have been a big part of the powerful Fed signaling effect that quickly helped repair credit markets earlier this year.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 903694, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Top Market News - Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2020", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jrtkg7/top_market_news_tuesday_nov_10_2020/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1605038651.0}], [[], false, "Sir_Meowstro", null, [], null, "text", "t2_10t2bv", false, false, [], false, false, 1604957654, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jr6y6u/direxion_work_from_home_etf_wfh/", {}, "jr6y6u", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 2, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/jr6y6u/direxion_work_from_home_etf_wfh/", false, 6, 1604957665, 1, "*Description* - \n\nThe Direxion Work From Home ETF offers exposure to companies across four technology pillars, allowing investors to gain exposure to those companies that stand to benefit from an increasingly flexible work environment.

Stocks slid Friday, but technology, communications services, health care and discretionary stocks had the biggest gains for the week, after it appeared Democrat Joe Biden could be the next president but with a split Congress.\n*****\n&gt; The election was still unresolved heading into the weekend, but even if Biden is declared winner, close votes and lawsuits are likely to result in recounts. The Senate appeared to be in Republican hands, but the margin of control is likely to be tight, and runoff elections are required for two Senate seats in Georgia in early January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the uncertainty is going to catch up the market on a short-term basis,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, BNY Mellon\u2019s Wealth Management chief investment officer. \u201cPerhaps next week could be a drifting lower kind of week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ahead of the election, the market had been betting on a \u201cblue wave,\u201d where Biden would take the White House and Democrats would get control of the Senate, giving them total control of Congress. But when it appeared the Senate would stay in Republican hands, stocks surged on the idea of gridlock, which would keep Biden from implementing tax increases and lots of new regulations.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, there has been a surge in daily new coronavirus cases to more than 122,000. Economists are concerned that the economic recovery could suffer as some states could restrict activities and consumers may pull back heading into the important holiday season.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed, in its post-meeting statement Thursday, repeated that the course of the virus could help determine the path of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports in the week ahead, including consumer price index inflation data Thursday and the producer price index Friday. More than a dozen Fed officials are on the speaking circuit, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who speaks Thursday on central banking at a European Central Bank forum.\n*****\n&gt; The earnings season is beginning to slow down, but there are still dozens of reports, including from McDonald\u2019s on Monday and Walt Disney, Applied Materials and Cisco on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is just setting up to be a breather. There\u2019s still a lot to figure out here,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cThe equity market\u2019s reaction has been I think understandable and probably better than many might have expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there may be uncertainty for awhile. \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking about is the Senate races. Part of the market reaction has been relying on this divided government.\u201d After the votes are all in or recounted, \u201ca sweep is unlikely but possible.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the longer this stays uncertain and messy, the more the post-election bounce comes into question,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Different than 2000\n&gt; It would not be unusual for the stock market to sell off before rallying into year end, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall does not expect the type of turbulence there was in 2000, when former Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush in a tight race that ultimately went to the Supreme Court.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn 2000, they were not expecting hanging chads. But they do expect a contested election this time. I think in many ways the market anticipated this,\u201d said Stovall.\n*****\n&gt; But the market, after its election week surge, could pull back. \u201cHistorically, the market goes down in the month of November, after a Democratic victory,\u201d said Stovall. Since World War II, Democrats won the White House nine times, and the market fell an average of 0.5% in November in those years, compared to the average gain for all Novembers of 1.4%, he said.\n*****\n&gt; After those Democratic victories, stocks then rose 1.9% in December on average, more than the normal 1.5% gain for all Decembers.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they currently do not expect the kind of lockdowns that states ordered when the pandemic started to spread in March. But there could still be some impact that could be negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said he sees some signs of optimism for the market. Strong data, like third quarter GDP, October\u2019s drop in unemployment to 6.9%, and the better-than-expected earnings are all positives for the market. Another is that investors are so skeptical.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat does still exist is a great deal of dry powder. There\u2019s $4.3 trillion in money markets alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you, being in touch with investors of all shapes and sizes this week, there\u2019s still a lot of skepticism. From a contrarian view, high cash and a lot of skepticism is a contrarian indicator.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WUlRQfd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FWN82Hs.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ZnTzBNz.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/g52vqsv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OiPuXi8.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lA86Kou.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xmtVSEB.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RRxlWej.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Piu5auo.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/W80POso.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eGUQXgr.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yoHWfIC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hQyweyw.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Presidential Election Anticipation Is Keeping Us Waiting\n\n&gt; While we all anxiously await the final count and outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election, here are some possible scenarios for 2021. Our analysis here is based on historical market performance during the most likely political alignments for next year. We ran these likely scenarios through the Almanac database software to create this graph.\n\n&gt; We are either going to have the fifth year of a two-term republican president or a first year of a new democratic presidency. It appears the democrats will hold the house and the republicans will hold the senate, but that is not a forgone conclusion either. So we also examined both presidential outcomes with a democratic, republican and split congress.\n\n&gt; Our study uses the S&amp;P 500 from 1949 to 2017. We start in 1949 because it is the first full 4-Year Presidential Stock Market Cycle since the end of WWII. The Twenty-Second Amendment that implemented presidential term limits for a max of two terms or eight years was ratified on February 27, 1951. Truman in 1949 was excluded as there was a no change of party in the White House. We gave Bush 41 the same treatment.\n\n&gt; Admittedly, there are limited data points; four each of fifth year republicans and first year democrats. Here\u2019s what we found. A change in party with a new, first year democratic president came with democratic control of Congress and significantly higher performance for the S&amp;P 500, averaging 10.6% with a median gain of 15.1% versus 7.0% for the average post-election year since 1949.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a89421df75f426e1b1ff90cb2c29cb90/b63e1cf962f89fdb-a3/s400x600/f9bde99a9e4ba83b0df266a8d3cc04cd732cc58f.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Fifth year republican presidents in 1957 (Eisenhower) and 1973 (Nixon) had to work with democratically controlled Congresses and the market suffered significant losses. The market did well in Reagan\u2019s fifth year with a split Congress \u2013 a testament to how \u201cThe Great Communicator\u201d was able to work across the aisle with then Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill. Even with republican control of Congress under Bush 43\u2019s fifth year, the market had a tough year with ongoing issues in Iraq, North Korea declaring it\u2019s a nuclear power and the most active and second costliest hurricane season on record.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Continues as COVID-19 Cases Rise\n\n&gt; The US labor market shrugged off election uncertainty and continued to add jobs in October. Despite the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 638,000 jobs, ahead of Bloomberg survey estimates calling for 580,000. The headline number was depressed by a 268,000 drop in government employment, including 147,000 temporary census workers. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9% despite a rise in the labor force participation rate, a reversal of the dynamic we saw in September when unemployment fell while the labor force participation also declined.\n\n&gt; However, a troubling trend remains beneath the surface. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the number of long-term unemployed\u2014those out of work for 27 weeks or longer\u2014continues to rise as a share of the total unemployed:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11.6.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhile the labor market has continued to show improvement, there are still many people out there who are having a hard time getting back to work,\u201d noted LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWith total jobs in the US around 10 million below pre-pandemic levels and rising COVID-19 cases, there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement despite the declining unemployment rate.\u201d\n\n&gt; COVID-19 cases in the United States have reached record highs with a weekly trend growth rate above 20%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. As the weather cools and more activity shifts indoors, additional restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could slow the fragile labor market recovery.\n\n&gt; In particular, much of the private sector gains in this month\u2019s jobs report were in the services sector, where previous jobs reports had shown strength in goods-oriented industries. Many countries in Europe have reinstated restrictions or even gone as far as implementing new lockdowns. While we don\u2019t expect lockdowns in the United States like we saw in March, restrictions on activity could limit future job gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Sentiment Survey Soars While Another Sinks\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we discussed how bullish sentiment in the AAII survey has been on the rise, but looking at another weekly sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence, the opposite is true. The percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell sharply this week, 7 percentage points, down to 53.6%. While a majority are still optimistic and that reading is in the middle of its range, that was the largest weekly decline since a 7.4 percentage point decline to 41.7% in the first week of March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, the percentage of newsletter writers that are \"looking for a correction\" rose sharply to 25.8% this week following last week's over 5% decline for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Correction.png))**\n\n&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey has a long history dating back to 1963, and in all weeks in that time, only 5% (174 weeks) have seen bullish sentiment fall 5 percentage points or more while the percentage of respondents looking for a correction has risen at least 5 percentage points in the same week. In the chart below, we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 following these past occurrences when there has not been another in the prior 3 months. The S&amp;P 500 has frequently been higher over the following weeks and months, but there is a slight underperformance relative to all periods since 1963 when the survey begins.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2 Post-Election Charts You Need to See\n\n&gt; The election is over, but the questions are mounting. We don\u2019t know who will be the next president as of Wednesday morning, but we do know that stocks tend to do well the final two months of an election year. \u201cOnce the uncertainty is over, stocks tend to rally in November and December, with November the best month of the year during an election year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOf course, 2020 isn\u2019t like any other year, and we still could be a ways away from who the winner will be.\u201d\n\n&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index tends to do very well the final two months of the year, especially during election years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The modern design of the S&amp;P 500 stock index was first launched in 1957. Performance back to 1928 incorporates the performance of predecessor index, the S&amp;P 90\n\n&gt; One of the big takeaways so far from Tuesday night is that the Senate likely will stay Republican, meaning we may have a divided Congress. The chances of higher taxes and more regulation likely took a hit under this scenario. This could be a nice tailwind for stocks, as the S&amp;P 500 historically has done quite well under a divided Congress, up more than 17% on average. Additionally, in years with a divided Congress, stocks have been higher the past 10 times, with 2020 potentially being the 11th in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-2-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; This election is far from over, so stay tuned to LPL Research as we continue to monitor things!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Emerging Markets Cheering a Potential Biden Win\n\n&gt; The US equity market has seen a massive rally in reaction to what is looking like a Biden victory over President Trump coupled with the Republican party maintianing its majority in the US Senate. None of these results are official at this point, so they are subject to change, but these are the most likely scenarios as of now. Outside of the US, emerging markets have also rallied. In just the last two days, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) has rallied 5% and broken above resistance to new 52-week highs. If for no other reason then Biden's campaign slogan isn't America First, the rationale behind the rally makes some sense.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-Now.png))**\n\n&gt; The reaction of EEM in the aftermath of this election is very much different from what happened in 2016. Heading into the 2016 election, EEM had been trending higher, but pulled back in the days leading up to the election and broke its uptrend that had been in place since earlier in the year. Again, Trump's America First approach was understandably viewed as a headwind to emerging market equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-labels.png))**\n\n&gt; While the initial reaction of EEM to Trump's election was negative, that weakness didn't last long. The chart below shows the performance of EEM in the two months before and one year after the 2016 election. The gray box represents the same period shown in the chart above. Within days after breaking its uptrend after the 2016 election, EEM bounced back, rallied to its 50-DMA, tested its November low, and then in the early days of 2017 it was off to the races as EEM. In fact, even accounting for the post-Election Day declines, one year after the 2016 election, EEM was up 25% which was actually more than the 21% return for the S&amp;P 500! The moral of the story here is that first reactions aren't always the right reactions, and as an investor it's not just imperative to know the environment you are operating in, but also when the tides are turning.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-2017.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Winners and Losers During Trump's Presidency\n\n&gt; With Election Day upon us, below we take a look at the biggest winners and losers across financial markets during the Trump Presidency from Election Day 2016 through today. First off, below is a chart of the market cap of the Russell 3,000 since Election Day 2000 which George W. Bush eventually won. The Russell 3,000 makes up more than 98% of the total US equity market cap, so it's a good gauge to use for measuring the overall change in market cap levels. The current market cap of the Russell 1000 is just north of $35 trillion, which is up $11.5 trillion since Election Day 2016. President Obama oversaw US market cap growth of $12.3 trillion over his two terms, while President Bush actually saw market cap decline by $4.1 trillion after his two terms.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/mktcap.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the total return of various asset classes since Election Day 2016 using key ETFs listed on US exchanges. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 70.6% since Trump was elected, while the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) more than doubled that at +144.3%. Of the broad index ETFs in the matrix, the Smallcap Value ETF (IJS) is up the least since Election Day 2016 at just +17.2%.\n\n&gt; Looking at US sector ETFs, the Energy sector (XLE) is a huge outlier with a decline of 48.3% since Trump was elected. Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are up the most with gains of 154% and 97%, respectively.\n\n&gt; Along with Energy stocks, the oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) ETFs have been more than cut in half since 11/8/16, while gold (GLD) is up 47% and silver is up 29.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/assetclass1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Not every country has seen stock market gains since Trump was elected. As shown below, Mexico (EWW) is down 28.5%, Brazil (EWZ) is down 19.4%, Spain (EWP) is down 6.8%, and the UK (EWU) is just slightly in the red.\n\n&gt; The US (SPY) is up more than any other country with a gain of 70.6%, while China (ASHR) is up the second most at +51%. Whatever happened with the trade war certainly didn't hurt the US and China versus the rest of the world on a relative basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/countryreturns1103.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/sectors1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Within the Russell 1,000 in its current form, there are nine stocks that are up 1,000% or more since Election Day 2016, with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at the top with a gain of 8,590%. Trade Desk (TTD) is up the second most at +2,448%, followed by Novocure (NVCR), SolarEdge Tech (SEDG), and Quidel (QDEL). Square (SQ) ranks sixth with a gain of 1,203%. Other notables on the list of big winners since Trump was elected include Etsy (ETSY), Teladoc (TDOC), Tesla (TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA), Atlassian (TEAM), Boston Beer (SAM), and Lululemon (LULU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-since-2016.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of market cap gains for individual stocks, the numbers below are quite eye-popping. Apple (AAPL) has gained the most in market cap since Trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! Amazingly, both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well. Prior to the last few years, no company was even close to having a $1 trillion market cap, but at this point, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT have gained that much in the last four years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/capuse.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Piu5auo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MDVAWXO.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Yme9cXS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a6Kp4iF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOR4bP6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TfDOPZJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OsrCLIc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N7Ibl9s.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/y4tBaZw.png))\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wVnvQZH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9PnmIUs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uoiA0Bw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Plug Power, Inc. $18.86\n**Plug Power, Inc.

Stocks slid Friday, but technology, communications services, health care and discretionary stocks had the biggest gains for the week, after it appeared Democrat Joe Biden could be the next president but with a split Congress.\n*****\n&gt; The election was still unresolved heading into the weekend, but even if Biden is declared winner, close votes and lawsuits are likely to result in recounts. The Senate appeared to be in Republican hands, but the margin of control is likely to be tight, and runoff elections are required for two Senate seats in Georgia in early January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the uncertainty is going to catch up the market on a short-term basis,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, BNY Mellon\u2019s Wealth Management chief investment officer. \u201cPerhaps next week could be a drifting lower kind of week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ahead of the election, the market had been betting on a \u201cblue wave,\u201d where Biden would take the White House and Democrats would get control of the Senate, giving them total control of Congress. But when it appeared the Senate would stay in Republican hands, stocks surged on the idea of gridlock, which would keep Biden from implementing tax increases and lots of new regulations.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, there has been a surge in daily new coronavirus cases to more than 122,000. Economists are concerned that the economic recovery could suffer as some states could restrict activities and consumers may pull back heading into the important holiday season.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed, in its post-meeting statement Thursday, repeated that the course of the virus could help determine the path of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports in the week ahead, including consumer price index inflation data Thursday and the producer price index Friday. More than a dozen Fed officials are on the speaking circuit, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who speaks Thursday on central banking at a European Central Bank forum.\n*****\n&gt; The earnings season is beginning to slow down, but there are still dozens of reports, including from McDonald\u2019s on Monday and Walt Disney, Applied Materials and Cisco on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is just setting up to be a breather. There\u2019s still a lot to figure out here,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cThe equity market\u2019s reaction has been I think understandable and probably better than many might have expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there may be uncertainty for awhile. \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking about is the Senate races. Part of the market reaction has been relying on this divided government.\u201d After the votes are all in or recounted, \u201ca sweep is unlikely but possible.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the longer this stays uncertain and messy, the more the post-election bounce comes into question,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Different than 2000\n&gt; It would not be unusual for the stock market to sell off before rallying into year end, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall does not expect the type of turbulence there was in 2000, when former Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush in a tight race that ultimately went to the Supreme Court.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn 2000, they were not expecting hanging chads. But they do expect a contested election this time. I think in many ways the market anticipated this,\u201d said Stovall.\n*****\n&gt; But the market, after its election week surge, could pull back. \u201cHistorically, the market goes down in the month of November, after a Democratic victory,\u201d said Stovall. Since World War II, Democrats won the White House nine times, and the market fell an average of 0.5% in November in those years, compared to the average gain for all Novembers of 1.4%, he said.\n*****\n&gt; After those Democratic victories, stocks then rose 1.9% in December on average, more than the normal 1.5% gain for all Decembers.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they currently do not expect the kind of lockdowns that states ordered when the pandemic started to spread in March. But there could still be some impact that could be negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said he sees some signs of optimism for the market. Strong data, like third quarter GDP, October\u2019s drop in unemployment to 6.9%, and the better-than-expected earnings are all positives for the market. Another is that investors are so skeptical.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat does still exist is a great deal of dry powder. There\u2019s $4.3 trillion in money markets alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you, being in touch with investors of all shapes and sizes this week, there\u2019s still a lot of skepticism. From a contrarian view, high cash and a lot of skepticism is a contrarian indicator.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WUlRQfd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FWN82Hs.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ZnTzBNz.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/g52vqsv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OiPuXi8.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lA86Kou.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xmtVSEB.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RRxlWej.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Piu5auo.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/W80POso.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eGUQXgr.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yoHWfIC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hQyweyw.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Presidential Election Anticipation Is Keeping Us Waiting\n\n&gt; While we all anxiously await the final count and outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election, here are some possible scenarios for 2021. Our analysis here is based on historical market performance during the most likely political alignments for next year. We ran these likely scenarios through the Almanac database software to create this graph.\n\n&gt; We are either going to have the fifth year of a two-term republican president or a first year of a new democratic presidency. It appears the democrats will hold the house and the republicans will hold the senate, but that is not a forgone conclusion either. So we also examined both presidential outcomes with a democratic, republican and split congress.\n\n&gt; Our study uses the S&amp;P 500 from 1949 to 2017. We start in 1949 because it is the first full 4-Year Presidential Stock Market Cycle since the end of WWII. The Twenty-Second Amendment that implemented presidential term limits for a max of two terms or eight years was ratified on February 27, 1951. Truman in 1949 was excluded as there was a no change of party in the White House. We gave Bush 41 the same treatment.\n\n&gt; Admittedly, there are limited data points; four each of fifth year republicans and first year democrats. Here\u2019s what we found. A change in party with a new, first year democratic president came with democratic control of Congress and significantly higher performance for the S&amp;P 500, averaging 10.6% with a median gain of 15.1% versus 7.0% for the average post-election year since 1949.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a89421df75f426e1b1ff90cb2c29cb90/b63e1cf962f89fdb-a3/s400x600/f9bde99a9e4ba83b0df266a8d3cc04cd732cc58f.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Fifth year republican presidents in 1957 (Eisenhower) and 1973 (Nixon) had to work with democratically controlled Congresses and the market suffered significant losses. The market did well in Reagan\u2019s fifth year with a split Congress \u2013 a testament to how \u201cThe Great Communicator\u201d was able to work across the aisle with then Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill. Even with republican control of Congress under Bush 43\u2019s fifth year, the market had a tough year with ongoing issues in Iraq, North Korea declaring it\u2019s a nuclear power and the most active and second costliest hurricane season on record.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Continues as COVID-19 Cases Rise\n\n&gt; The US labor market shrugged off election uncertainty and continued to add jobs in October. Despite the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 638,000 jobs, ahead of Bloomberg survey estimates calling for 580,000. The headline number was depressed by a 268,000 drop in government employment, including 147,000 temporary census workers. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9% despite a rise in the labor force participation rate, a reversal of the dynamic we saw in September when unemployment fell while the labor force participation also declined.\n\n&gt; However, a troubling trend remains beneath the surface. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the number of long-term unemployed\u2014those out of work for 27 weeks or longer\u2014continues to rise as a share of the total unemployed:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11.6.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhile the labor market has continued to show improvement, there are still many people out there who are having a hard time getting back to work,\u201d noted LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWith total jobs in the US around 10 million below pre-pandemic levels and rising COVID-19 cases, there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement despite the declining unemployment rate.\u201d\n\n&gt; COVID-19 cases in the United States have reached record highs with a weekly trend growth rate above 20%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. As the weather cools and more activity shifts indoors, additional restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could slow the fragile labor market recovery.\n\n&gt; In particular, much of the private sector gains in this month\u2019s jobs report were in the services sector, where previous jobs reports had shown strength in goods-oriented industries. Many countries in Europe have reinstated restrictions or even gone as far as implementing new lockdowns. While we don\u2019t expect lockdowns in the United States like we saw in March, restrictions on activity could limit future job gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Sentiment Survey Soars While Another Sinks\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we discussed how bullish sentiment in the AAII survey has been on the rise, but looking at another weekly sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence, the opposite is true. The percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell sharply this week, 7 percentage points, down to 53.6%. While a majority are still optimistic and that reading is in the middle of its range, that was the largest weekly decline since a 7.4 percentage point decline to 41.7% in the first week of March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, the percentage of newsletter writers that are \"looking for a correction\" rose sharply to 25.8% this week following last week's over 5% decline for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Correction.png))**\n\n&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey has a long history dating back to 1963, and in all weeks in that time, only 5% (174 weeks) have seen bullish sentiment fall 5 percentage points or more while the percentage of respondents looking for a correction has risen at least 5 percentage points in the same week. In the chart below, we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 following these past occurrences when there has not been another in the prior 3 months. The S&amp;P 500 has frequently been higher over the following weeks and months, but there is a slight underperformance relative to all periods since 1963 when the survey begins.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2 Post-Election Charts You Need to See\n\n&gt; The election is over, but the questions are mounting. We don\u2019t know who will be the next president as of Wednesday morning, but we do know that stocks tend to do well the final two months of an election year. \u201cOnce the uncertainty is over, stocks tend to rally in November and December, with November the best month of the year during an election year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOf course, 2020 isn\u2019t like any other year, and we still could be a ways away from who the winner will be.\u201d\n\n&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index tends to do very well the final two months of the year, especially during election years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The modern design of the S&amp;P 500 stock index was first launched in 1957. Performance back to 1928 incorporates the performance of predecessor index, the S&amp;P 90\n\n&gt; One of the big takeaways so far from Tuesday night is that the Senate likely will stay Republican, meaning we may have a divided Congress. The chances of higher taxes and more regulation likely took a hit under this scenario. This could be a nice tailwind for stocks, as the S&amp;P 500 historically has done quite well under a divided Congress, up more than 17% on average. Additionally, in years with a divided Congress, stocks have been higher the past 10 times, with 2020 potentially being the 11th in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-2-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; This election is far from over, so stay tuned to LPL Research as we continue to monitor things!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Emerging Markets Cheering a Potential Biden Win\n\n&gt; The US equity market has seen a massive rally in reaction to what is looking like a Biden victory over President Trump coupled with the Republican party maintianing its majority in the US Senate. None of these results are official at this point, so they are subject to change, but these are the most likely scenarios as of now. Outside of the US, emerging markets have also rallied. In just the last two days, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) has rallied 5% and broken above resistance to new 52-week highs. If for no other reason then Biden's campaign slogan isn't America First, the rationale behind the rally makes some sense.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-Now.png))**\n\n&gt; The reaction of EEM in the aftermath of this election is very much different from what happened in 2016. Heading into the 2016 election, EEM had been trending higher, but pulled back in the days leading up to the election and broke its uptrend that had been in place since earlier in the year. Again, Trump's America First approach was understandably viewed as a headwind to emerging market equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-labels.png))**\n\n&gt; While the initial reaction of EEM to Trump's election was negative, that weakness didn't last long. The chart below shows the performance of EEM in the two months before and one year after the 2016 election. The gray box represents the same period shown in the chart above. Within days after breaking its uptrend after the 2016 election, EEM bounced back, rallied to its 50-DMA, tested its November low, and then in the early days of 2017 it was off to the races as EEM. In fact, even accounting for the post-Election Day declines, one year after the 2016 election, EEM was up 25% which was actually more than the 21% return for the S&amp;P 500! The moral of the story here is that first reactions aren't always the right reactions, and as an investor it's not just imperative to know the environment you are operating in, but also when the tides are turning.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-2017.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Winners and Losers During Trump's Presidency\n\n&gt; With Election Day upon us, below we take a look at the biggest winners and losers across financial markets during the Trump Presidency from Election Day 2016 through today. First off, below is a chart of the market cap of the Russell 3,000 since Election Day 2000 which George W. Bush eventually won. The Russell 3,000 makes up more than 98% of the total US equity market cap, so it's a good gauge to use for measuring the overall change in market cap levels. The current market cap of the Russell 1000 is just north of $35 trillion, which is up $11.5 trillion since Election Day 2016. President Obama oversaw US market cap growth of $12.3 trillion over his two terms, while President Bush actually saw market cap decline by $4.1 trillion after his two terms.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/mktcap.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the total return of various asset classes since Election Day 2016 using key ETFs listed on US exchanges. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 70.6% since Trump was elected, while the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) more than doubled that at +144.3%. Of the broad index ETFs in the matrix, the Smallcap Value ETF (IJS) is up the least since Election Day 2016 at just +17.2%.\n\n&gt; Looking at US sector ETFs, the Energy sector (XLE) is a huge outlier with a decline of 48.3% since Trump was elected. Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are up the most with gains of 154% and 97%, respectively.\n\n&gt; Along with Energy stocks, the oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) ETFs have been more than cut in half since 11/8/16, while gold (GLD) is up 47% and silver is up 29.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/assetclass1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Not every country has seen stock market gains since Trump was elected. As shown below, Mexico (EWW) is down 28.5%, Brazil (EWZ) is down 19.4%, Spain (EWP) is down 6.8%, and the UK (EWU) is just slightly in the red.\n\n&gt; The US (SPY) is up more than any other country with a gain of 70.6%, while China (ASHR) is up the second most at +51%. Whatever happened with the trade war certainly didn't hurt the US and China versus the rest of the world on a relative basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/countryreturns1103.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/sectors1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Within the Russell 1,000 in its current form, there are nine stocks that are up 1,000% or more since Election Day 2016, with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at the top with a gain of 8,590%. Trade Desk (TTD) is up the second most at +2,448%, followed by Novocure (NVCR), SolarEdge Tech (SEDG), and Quidel (QDEL). Square (SQ) ranks sixth with a gain of 1,203%. Other notables on the list of big winners since Trump was elected include Etsy (ETSY), Teladoc (TDOC), Tesla (TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA), Atlassian (TEAM), Boston Beer (SAM), and Lululemon (LULU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-since-2016.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of market cap gains for individual stocks, the numbers below are quite eye-popping. Apple (AAPL) has gained the most in market cap since Trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! Amazingly, both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well.

In its defense $FE has asserted that it acted ethically in its actions.\n\nHowever even assuming the worst the $6bn drop in market cap seems to exceed any likely downside.\n\n* $FE has not received any benefit from the alleged bribery (the relevant HB6 legislation does not come into effect until next year),\n* the overall impact of HB6 is not material for $FE (the stock did not move significantly when it was signed\n* the $6bn drop in market cap far exceeds the total $60M bribery\n* The $6bn drop in market cap far exceeds comparable cases (Exelon paid a $200M fine for bribery in Illinois in July)\n\nAll in all the valuation looks attractive with a trailing PE of 12 and forward dividend yield of 4.9%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn **Tuesday** Booking.com $BKNG set out nine travel related predictions based on research from more than 20,000 travellers across 28 countries with insights from proprietary search and endorsement data. Perhaps not surprisingly it was bullish about the outlook for travel with a significant majority of people said to be excited by the prospect of travelling again while over 30% said they wanted to travel more to make up for lost time.\n\nThat's exactly what Booking.com\u2019s investors want to hear. The pandemic has clearly had a huge impact on the company. However, recently Booking has witnessed a recovery in its business. Newly booked room nights have steadily improved, from 15% of their normal level in April to 65% of their normal level in July.\n\nThe company has reinforced their liquidity with $10.5 billion of cash compared to $11.5 billion of debt and cash flow is almost neutral (usually +$5 billion). Consequently the company appears surefooted.\n\nThe valuation meanwhile is still down 20% from 2018 highs and trading on just 18x last years earnings. That looks cheap with strong balance sheet and the expected rebound in demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSemiconductor test equipment maker Teradyne $TER saw its shares surge 4.7% on **Wednesday** after the company delivered better-than-expected third-quarter results and guidance;\n\n* earnings rose 53% while sales climbed 41%\n* Q4 guidance is for an adjusted EPS $0.98 on sales of $710 million. Compared to consensus $0.50 on sales of $543.1 million\n\nTeradyne sells advanced testing equipment for chips (72%), wireless devices (5%) and electronic systems (14%). It also makes industrial automation equipment (9%), including collaborative and mobile robots.\n\nThe medium term outlook for testing is strong with the widespread roll out of 5G and suppressed demand expected to be released from Auto and Industry. Chief Executive Mark Jagiela said \"Entering Q4, market conditions in our test businesses are stronger than expected and we've positioned our production capacity to respond to potential short lead time demands as we move through the quarter.\"\n\nThe trailing PE of 23.55 looks attractive given the expected medium term outperformance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn **Thursday** Align jumped 35% after reporting knock out earnings as the CEO credited the \u201cZoom effect\u201d for making people more aware of their crooked smiles. Revenue was up 21% and adjusted EPS came in at $2.25 compared to consensus of $0.64.\n\nIf true, that driver should apply to other dentistry companies such as SmileDirectClub which is expected to report earnings the week commencing November 10th. Both companies are growing quickly and share a huge total addressable market yet SDC is a valued at just 5x revenues compared to Align\u2019s valuation that is closer to 15x.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn **Friday** shares of biotech start-up Compass Pathways $CMPS shot up 17% before settling back to close up 12% on the day after the chairman, co-founder, and chief executive officer (CEO) George Goldsmith appeared on CNBC to tell his company's story, causing the jump.  Specifically he discussed the company's approach to transforming mental healthcare, using psilocybin, the active ingredient in psychedelic, or \"magic\" mushrooms.\n\nThe company is currently in Phase 2b of its clinical trials, where the efficacy of the treatment is tested. Goldsmith also noted that the treatment has received breakthrough therapy designation from the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA), allowing it to expedite the development and review of the therapy. \n\nIn addition to the U.S., the UK-based company is doing clinical trials in eight other countries. The company expects to complete and report on its Phase 2b trials at the end of 2021, Goldsmith said in the interview. \n\nCompass initially plans to use its psilocybin therapy for patients with treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, addiction and other mental illnesses. The treatment combines the use of the psychoactive substance with trained therapist psychological support.\n\nWith 3.4 million sufferers, we get a $4 billion total addressable market if we assume 15% penetration and $8,000 cost.  Compass\u2019 $1.3 billion market cap looks cheap in comparison.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, my favorite story this week.  On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne maintained a Hold rating on Liberty Broadband $LBRDK and set a price target of $174.00. That\u2019s below the analyst consensus of a Moderate Buy with an average price target of $183.33 but enough above the current $140 to make it interesting.\n\nLiberty Broadband was created in September 2014 when Liberty Media spun off its cable businesses into a new unit. It was a typically complex arrangement by to avoid tax liabilities but the important part is that LBRDK ended up holding a 25% stake in Charter Communications $CHTR. Then, in May 2016, Charter acquired both Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, quadrupling the number of customers and becoming the second-largest cable company in the US after Comcast.\n\nCharter is now trading at around $592, so Liberty\u2019s original investment is worth $35 billion. That is interesting because LBRDK\u2019s other assets and liabilities are fairly trivial and the $35 billion asset offers a striking premium to the current market cap of $25 billion.\n\nImportantly there are a couple of catalysts here that should drive these two values together. The Liberty group is taking steps to simplify its structure with the merger of GCI Liberty and Liberty Broadband. That will reduce some overhead costs and allow cross shareholdings to be collapsed in a tax efficient manner. Secondly, LBRDK announced an expansion of its buyback program from $200 million to $1.2billion, citing the widening discount to NAV.\n\nThese measures may not be enough by themselves to drive these two values together but show that management is now addressing the issue. In the meantime shareholders get to hold a stake in Charter at a discount. Not bad given the $CHTR stock has performed well  (up 20% over 12 months) and could well have further to run. Cable is still one of the dominant / most efficient broadband technologies today and CHTR's management team is regarded as one of the most experienced teams in the cable industry.

In its defense $FE has asserted that it acted ethically in its actions.\n\nHowever even assuming the worst the $6bn drop in market cap seems to exceed any likely downside.\n\n* $FE has not received any benefit from the alleged bribery (the relevant HB6 legislation does not come into effect until next year),\n* the overall impact of HB6 is not material for $FE (the stock did not move significantly when it was signed\n* the $6bn drop in market cap far exceeds the total $60M bribery\n* The $6bn drop in market cap far exceeds comparable cases (Exelon paid a $200M fine for bribery in Illinois in July)\n\nAll in all the valuation looks attractive with a trailing PE of 12 and forward dividend yield of 4.9%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn **Tuesday** Booking.com $BKNG set out nine travel related predictions based on research from more than 20,000 travellers across 28 countries with insights from proprietary search and endorsement data. Perhaps not surprisingly it was bullish about the outlook for travel with a significant majority of people said to be excited by the prospect of travelling again while over 30% said they wanted to travel more to make up for lost time.\n\nThat's exactly what Booking.com\u2019s investors want to hear. The pandemic has clearly had a huge impact on the company. However, recently Booking has witnessed a recovery in its business. Newly booked room nights have steadily improved, from 15% of their normal level in April to 65% of their normal level in July.\n\nThe company has reinforced their liquidity with $10.5 billion of cash compared to $11.5 billion of debt and cash flow is almost neutral (usually +$5 billion). Consequently the company appears surefooted.\n\nThe valuation meanwhile is still down 20% from 2018 highs and trading on just 18x last years earnings. That looks cheap with strong balance sheet and the expected rebound in demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSemiconductor test equipment maker Teradyne $TER saw its shares surge 4.7% on **Wednesday** after the company delivered better-than-expected third-quarter results and guidance;\n\n* earnings rose 53% while sales climbed 41%\n* Q4 guidance is for an adjusted EPS $0.98 on sales of $710 million. Compared to consensus $0.50 on sales of $543.1 million\n\nTeradyne sells advanced testing equipment for chips (72%), wireless devices (5%) and electronic systems (14%). It also makes industrial automation equipment (9%), including collaborative and mobile robots.\n\nThe medium term outlook for testing is strong with the widespread roll out of 5G and suppressed demand expected to be released from Auto and Industry. Chief Executive Mark Jagiela said \"Entering Q4, market conditions in our test businesses are stronger than expected and we've positioned our production capacity to respond to potential short lead time demands as we move through the quarter.\"\n\nThe trailing PE of 23.55 looks attractive given the expected medium term outperformance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn **Thursday** Align jumped 35% after reporting knock out earnings as the CEO credited the \u201cZoom effect\u201d for making people more aware of their crooked smiles. Revenue was up 21% and adjusted EPS came in at $2.25 compared to consensus of $0.64.\n\nIf true, that driver should apply to other dentistry companies such as SmileDirectClub which is expected to report earnings the week commencing November 10th. Both companies are growing quickly and share a huge total addressable market yet SDC is a valued at just 5x revenues compared to Align\u2019s valuation that is closer to 15x.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn **Friday** shares of biotech start-up Compass Pathways $CMPS shot up 17% before settling back to close up 12% on the day after the chairman, co-founder, and chief executive officer (CEO) George Goldsmith appeared on CNBC to tell his company's story, causing the jump.  Specifically he discussed the company's approach to transforming mental healthcare, using psilocybin, the active ingredient in psychedelic, or \"magic\" mushrooms.\n\nThe company is currently in Phase 2b of its clinical trials, where the efficacy of the treatment is tested. Goldsmith also noted that the treatment has received breakthrough therapy designation from the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA), allowing it to expedite the development and review of the therapy. \n\nIn addition to the U.S., the UK-based company is doing clinical trials in eight other countries. The company expects to complete and report on its Phase 2b trials at the end of 2021, Goldsmith said in the interview. \n\nCompass initially plans to use its psilocybin therapy for patients with treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, addiction and other mental illnesses. The treatment combines the use of the psychoactive substance with trained therapist psychological support.\n\nWith 3.4 million sufferers, we get a $4 billion total addressable market if we assume 15% penetration and $8,000 cost.  Compass\u2019 $1.3 billion market cap looks cheap in comparison.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, my favorite story this week.  On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne maintained a Hold rating on Liberty Broadband $LBRDK and set a price target of $174.00. That\u2019s below the analyst consensus of a Moderate Buy with an average price target of $183.33 but enough above the current $140 to make it interesting.\n\nLiberty Broadband was created in September 2014 when Liberty Media spun off its cable businesses into a new unit. It was a typically complex arrangement by to avoid tax liabilities but the important part is that LBRDK ended up holding a 25% stake in Charter Communications $CHTR. Then, in May 2016, Charter acquired both Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, quadrupling the number of customers and becoming the second-largest cable company in the US after Comcast.\n\nCharter is now trading at around $592, so Liberty\u2019s original investment is worth $35 billion. That is interesting because LBRDK\u2019s other assets and liabilities are fairly trivial and the $35 billion asset offers a striking premium to the current market cap of $25 billion.\n\nImportantly there are a couple of catalysts here that should drive these two values together. The Liberty group is taking steps to simplify its structure with the merger of GCI Liberty and Liberty Broadband. That will reduce some overhead costs and allow cross shareholdings to be collapsed in a tax efficient manner. Secondly, LBRDK announced an expansion of its buyback program from $200 million to $1.2billion, citing the widening discount to NAV.\n\nThese measures may not be enough by themselves to drive these two values together but show that management is now addressing the issue. In the meantime shareholders get to hold a stake in Charter at a discount. Not bad given the $CHTR stock has performed well  (up 20% over 12 months) and could well have further to run. Cable is still one of the dominant / most efficient broadband technologies today and CHTR's management team is regarded as one of the most experienced teams in the cable industry. Additionally, the impact of COVID has been immaterial and the stock is up 10% since February.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cFollow\u201d me to get updates and links during the week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.

I'd be thrilled if you use the information here to come up with your own predictions to compare.\n\nLet me know your thoughts. Happy to discuss :)  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Investment Thesis**\n\nSprout is a growing technology company operating in the content management industry. They have seen significant growth in revenues, with an increase of 75.43% and 30.43% in core revenues for 2018 and 2019 respectively.\n\nWe expect their revenues to grow at a slightly slower rate as the market for social media content software matures, and market entrants are able to take market share.\n\nSprout has been unable to maintain an effective moat, keeping it unable to reach profitability.\n\nThesis: Because of Sprout\u2019s inability to differentiate itself through either product or target market, their spend on marketing and advertising will continue to outpace its revenue growth and keep it from profitability.\n\nFor these reasons, we believe Sprout is significantly overvalued.\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nSprout Social was founded and had its first round of funding for $1 million in 2010. The product, Sprout 2.0, was launched the following year. Since then, Sprout has grown to nearly $103 million in annual sales as of 2019.\u00a0\n\nSprout has come about in a competitive industry and struggled to establish an effective moat. However, the brand is well known by users and potential customers. It is easily identifiable by its leaf logo.\n\nSprout operates as a content management system for social media sites. The site offers easy-to-use software and visually appealing dashboards and reports. Also offered is analytics for marketing campaigns on the social sites.\n\nThe software allows for content management across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google, and Youtube. It allows for post scheduling, engagement, and analytics across all platforms.\u00a0\n\nHaving a centralized location for all of these features for a marketing team allows for stronger review of the effectiveness of social media campaigns and easier collaboration for marketing teams.\n\nSprout offers its products on a per-user basis and opens up plenty of opportunity to upsell either additional features, or add on users.\u00a0\n\nIn addition to subscription revenue, Sprout also generates revenue from professional services fees. These are primarily implementation costs by Sprout\u2019s technical teams.\n\nThe company has not done much in the way of finding a niche. However, it does have different offerings for small businesses and larger enterprises on its site.\u00a0\n\nSprout seems to want to appeal to all sizes of companies as it grows. Given the competitive industry, this may not be an effective strategy long-term.\n\n**Industry Overview**\n\nThe industry that Sprout operates in \u2013 social media content management- is relatively new on the scene. Sprout was one of the earlier contenders in the space and managed to grow to a respectable size.\n\nLike all those in the social media space, Sprout\u2019s dashboards are sleek and their software is easy-to-use. Because of this, it\u2019s had high user scores and customer retention.\n\nThese are definitely points for a higher valuation for Sprout, but there is nothing that Sprout has that is unique to them in this sense.\u00a0\n\nAll the points that Sprout maintains for strong user experience, their competitors do too. It is simply expected of the companies in the industry now, not a standout feature.\n\nSprout has many competitors, but their most notable ones would be Hootsuite and Hubspot.\n\nOf these, Hubspot appears to be best for smaller companies. Their starting price point is much lower than Hootsuite at $50/month compared to Hootsuite\u2019s $190/month.\n\nDespite this, Hootsuite claims to cater to smaller and medium-sized companies.\u00a0\n\nSprout targets both large and small companies, but because they have not identified a niche, they are likely to lose market share to Hootsuite in the small business market with their lower entry price point.\n\nAlso troubling for Sprout is their lack of transparency. Of the three, Sprout is the only one that does not offer a minimum price on their website.\n\nAgain, this could cause a loss in the small business market. But it would be less likely to lose market share in the more sophisticated large business market, where potential users would be more willing to ask for a consultation for pricing and customization.\n\n**Strengths**\n\nSprout has a strong balance sheet and cash position. This strength, however, points to a hidden weakness. The company is about ten years old, and in that time, it is still funded primarily through rounds of equity funding, not positive operating cash flow.\n\nThis means it has not reached profitability yet, and its cash burn reflects that. Despite the negative operating and investing cash flows, Sprout\u2019s 2019 IPO funding should keep its balance sheet and cash position stable for at least a few more years, even if it cannot reach positive cash flows.\n\nAnother strength of Sprout\u2019s is its revenue growth rate. High growth is expected for a new technology company, however. Its core revenues grew a staggering 75.43% and 30.43% for years 2018 and 2019, respectively.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\nFor Sprout\u2019s weaknesses, we can compare operating results to competing companies to see where they may be underperforming in the broader industry.\n\nSprout\u2019s gross profit appears strong, with a gross margin hovering around 25% over years 2017-2019. It increases slightly from year to year.\n\nCost of revenue consists primarily of hosting costs and providing support to customers on the platform.\u00a0\n\nWhile this margin would be very admirable for a company offering a tangible product, software companies are generally expected to maintain lower gross profit margins.\n\nFor comparison, Hubspot\u2019s gross profit margin is 19.26% for 2019. This leads us to believe Hubspot is more efficient in offering its products and services to its customers than Sprout is.\n\nHubspot\u2019s average annual growth rate in its core revenues hovers around 30-40%. Although this rate is slightly lower than Sprout posted in 2018 of 75.43%, it controls significantly more market share.\u00a0\n\nHubspot\u2019s 2019 revenues were $674 million, compared to Sprout\u2019s $103 million.\n\nGiven that Sprout is significantly smaller than Hubspot, we would expect Sprout\u2019s revenues to be growing at a faster rate than Hubspot since there is more market share available for Sprout to take.\n\nThis leads us to believe there are inefficiencies in the marketing department for Sprout that are hampering its growth potential. It also appears there are operational inefficiencies reducing its ability to improve its profit margin.\n\n**Opportunities**\n\nThe industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.1%, and we forecasted Sprout\u2019s revenues at a generous range of growth from 50% to 17% CAGR over a ten year period.\u00a0\n\nSprout\u2019s primary opportunities will come from the growth in the industry around it. The other opportunity it should benefit from is its age and the benefits that it affords. This will primarily come from its contacts at larger companies.\n\nSprout should see sufficient cross-selling opportunities in the companies it already transacts with. And the fact that it utilizes a per-user pricing model means that as a client of theirs grows, the more users it may need to license.\n\nCustomer build-up and increased user licenses means customer retention will be increasingly important. Luckily for Sprout, this is already one of their strong points. Out of 1,326 reviews, Sprout has maintained a user score of 4.3 / 5 stars.\u00a0\n\nCustomer retention should over time reduce marketing and sales spending, as this is such a large component of their total expenses. In 2019, marketing and sales spending represented more than 45% of total expenses.\n\nKeeping this amount in check over time should significantly increase the chance of profitability.\n\n**Threats**\n\nSprout\u2019s primary threat is its inability to gain significant market share. Its marketing spend appears to be less effective than its competitor Hubspot.\u00a0\n\nHubspot expands its selling and marketing expenses by roughly 25-30% per year, whereas Sprout\u2019s expands at roughly 50% per year. Despite this, Hubspot is growing at a comparable rate to Sprout even though it controls roughly 6x as much market share.\n\nIf Sprout is unable to gain more market share in a reasonable time period going forward, profitability will be out of reach. Their cash burn rate for 2019 was nearly 33%, and without more rounds of funding they could be facing a liquidity problem within a few years.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nWe forecasted Sprout's growth rate at a rate from 50% declining down to 17% CAGR over the next ten years. Because of the information above, marketing and advertising were kept at a high CAGR as well. We then discounted free cash flows back to present at a 15% rate to account for Sprout's volatility as a young and unprofitable company.\n\nThis gave us a NPV of $3.23 per share, significantly lower than its current share price as of 10/22/2020 ($49.46).\n\nWe encourage you to do your own valuation and compare.

I'd be thrilled if you use the information here to come up with your own predictions to compare.\n\nLet me know your thoughts. Happy to discuss :)  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Investment Thesis**\n\nSprout is a growing technology company operating in the content management industry. They have seen significant growth in revenues, with an increase of 75.43% and 30.43% in core revenues for 2018 and 2019 respectively.\n\nWe expect their revenues to grow at a slightly slower rate as the market for social media content software matures, and market entrants are able to take market share.\n\nSprout has been unable to maintain an effective moat, keeping it unable to reach profitability.\n\nThesis: Because of Sprout\u2019s inability to differentiate itself through either product or target market, their spend on marketing and advertising will continue to outpace its revenue growth and keep it from profitability.\n\nFor these reasons, we believe Sprout is significantly overvalued.\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nSprout Social was founded and had its first round of funding for $1 million in 2010. The product, Sprout 2.0, was launched the following year. Since then, Sprout has grown to nearly $103 million in annual sales as of 2019.\u00a0\n\nSprout has come about in a competitive industry and struggled to establish an effective moat. However, the brand is well known by users and potential customers. It is easily identifiable by its leaf logo.\n\nSprout operates as a content management system for social media sites. The site offers easy-to-use software and visually appealing dashboards and reports. Also offered is analytics for marketing campaigns on the social sites.\n\nThe software allows for content management across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google, and Youtube. It allows for post scheduling, engagement, and analytics across all platforms.\u00a0\n\nHaving a centralized location for all of these features for a marketing team allows for stronger review of the effectiveness of social media campaigns and easier collaboration for marketing teams.\n\nSprout offers its products on a per-user basis and opens up plenty of opportunity to upsell either additional features, or add on users.\u00a0\n\nIn addition to subscription revenue, Sprout also generates revenue from professional services fees. These are primarily implementation costs by Sprout\u2019s technical teams.\n\nThe company has not done much in the way of finding a niche. However, it does have different offerings for small businesses and larger enterprises on its site.\u00a0\n\nSprout seems to want to appeal to all sizes of companies as it grows. Given the competitive industry, this may not be an effective strategy long-term.\n\n**Industry Overview**\n\nThe industry that Sprout operates in \u2013 social media content management- is relatively new on the scene. Sprout was one of the earlier contenders in the space and managed to grow to a respectable size.\n\nLike all those in the social media space, Sprout\u2019s dashboards are sleek and their software is easy-to-use. Because of this, it\u2019s had high user scores and customer retention.\n\nThese are definitely points for a higher valuation for Sprout, but there is nothing that Sprout has that is unique to them in this sense.\u00a0\n\nAll the points that Sprout maintains for strong user experience, their competitors do too. It is simply expected of the companies in the industry now, not a standout feature.\n\nSprout has many competitors, but their most notable ones would be Hootsuite and Hubspot.\n\nOf these, Hubspot appears to be best for smaller companies. Their starting price point is much lower than Hootsuite at $50/month compared to Hootsuite\u2019s $190/month.\n\nDespite this, Hootsuite claims to cater to smaller and medium-sized companies.\u00a0\n\nSprout targets both large and small companies, but because they have not identified a niche, they are likely to lose market share to Hootsuite in the small business market with their lower entry price point.\n\nAlso troubling for Sprout is their lack of transparency. Of the three, Sprout is the only one that does not offer a minimum price on their website.\n\nAgain, this could cause a loss in the small business market. But it would be less likely to lose market share in the more sophisticated large business market, where potential users would be more willing to ask for a consultation for pricing and customization.\n\n**Strengths**\n\nSprout has a strong balance sheet and cash position. This strength, however, points to a hidden weakness. The company is about ten years old, and in that time, it is still funded primarily through rounds of equity funding, not positive operating cash flow.\n\nThis means it has not reached profitability yet, and its cash burn reflects that. Despite the negative operating and investing cash flows, Sprout\u2019s 2019 IPO funding should keep its balance sheet and cash position stable for at least a few more years, even if it cannot reach positive cash flows.\n\nAnother strength of Sprout\u2019s is its revenue growth rate. High growth is expected for a new technology company, however. Its core revenues grew a staggering 75.43% and 30.43% for years 2018 and 2019, respectively.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\nFor Sprout\u2019s weaknesses, we can compare operating results to competing companies to see where they may be underperforming in the broader industry.\n\nSprout\u2019s gross profit appears strong, with a gross margin hovering around 25% over years 2017-2019. It increases slightly from year to year.\n\nCost of revenue consists primarily of hosting costs and providing support to customers on the platform.\u00a0\n\nWhile this margin would be very admirable for a company offering a tangible product, software companies are generally expected to maintain lower gross profit margins.\n\nFor comparison, Hubspot\u2019s gross profit margin is 19.26% for 2019. This leads us to believe Hubspot is more efficient in offering its products and services to its customers than Sprout is.\n\nHubspot\u2019s average annual growth rate in its core revenues hovers around 30-40%. Although this rate is slightly lower than Sprout posted in 2018 of 75.43%, it controls significantly more market share.\u00a0\n\nHubspot\u2019s 2019 revenues were $674 million, compared to Sprout\u2019s $103 million.\n\nGiven that Sprout is significantly smaller than Hubspot, we would expect Sprout\u2019s revenues to be growing at a faster rate than Hubspot since there is more market share available for Sprout to take.\n\nThis leads us to believe there are inefficiencies in the marketing department for Sprout that are hampering its growth potential. It also appears there are operational inefficiencies reducing its ability to improve its profit margin.\n\n**Opportunities**\n\nThe industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.1%, and we forecasted Sprout\u2019s revenues at a generous range of growth from 50% to 17% CAGR over a ten year period.\u00a0\n\nSprout\u2019s primary opportunities will come from the growth in the industry around it. The other opportunity it should benefit from is its age and the benefits that it affords. This will primarily come from its contacts at larger companies.\n\nSprout should see sufficient cross-selling opportunities in the companies it already transacts with. And the fact that it utilizes a per-user pricing model means that as a client of theirs grows, the more users it may need to license.\n\nCustomer build-up and increased user licenses means customer retention will be increasingly important. Luckily for Sprout, this is already one of their strong points. Out of 1,326 reviews, Sprout has maintained a user score of 4.3 / 5 stars.\u00a0\n\nCustomer retention should over time reduce marketing and sales spending, as this is such a large component of their total expenses. In 2019, marketing and sales spending represented more than 45% of total expenses.\n\nKeeping this amount in check over time should significantly increase the chance of profitability.\n\n**Threats**\n\nSprout\u2019s primary threat is its inability to gain significant market share. Its marketing spend appears to be less effective than its competitor Hubspot.\u00a0\n\nHubspot expands its selling and marketing expenses by roughly 25-30% per year, whereas Sprout\u2019s expands at roughly 50% per year. Despite this, Hubspot is growing at a comparable rate to Sprout even though it controls roughly 6x as much market share.\n\nIf Sprout is unable to gain more market share in a reasonable time period going forward, profitability will be out of reach. Their cash burn rate for 2019 was nearly 33%, and without more rounds of funding they could be facing a liquidity problem within a few years.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nWe forecasted Sprout's growth rate at a rate from 50% declining down to 17% CAGR over the next ten years. Because of the information above, marketing and advertising were kept at a high CAGR as well. We then discounted free cash flows back to present at a 15% rate to account for Sprout's volatility as a young and unprofitable company.\n\nThis gave us a NPV of $3.23 per share, significantly lower than its current share price as of 10/22/2020 ($49.46).\n\nWe encourage you to do your own valuation and compare.

card payments via tap, dip or swipe, internally with the help of a team gained from its 2017 WePay acquisition.\n\nJPMorgan will soon migrate \u201ca large portion\u201d of its more than three million

Fastly down 30%+ after a revenue warning. And Zoom rose to a record after its Zoomtopia analyst event. The year of 2020 has once again amazed me. I guess I \u2018m getting old.\n\nFastly reports preliminary Q3 revenue 70-71 mil, which is 5.6% lower than estimated 74.7 mil (Bloomberg number). This 5.6% drop in revenue triggered a 31% selloff, but I was not surprised about that. I knew this would happen one day. As I quote a [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/fastly-plunge-is-reminder-of-valuation-excesses-in-software) \u201cFastly\u2019s slowdown highlights the precariousness of lofty software valuations. **Massive share plunges are the price paid when these businesses fall short of perfection**.\u201d Exactly, **a perfect dream is destined to end in our imperfect world**.\n\n**Even though the FSLY lesson has come out, investors are not learning anything at all.**\n\n# Zoomtopia\n\nZM\u2019s meteoric rise surprised me. Ahead of the Zoomtopia event, on Monday, ZM\u2019s price was 491.54. Today it traded at a high of 563, a 14%+ rise. So what happened on the Zoomtopia event that has caused such a ZM euphoria?\n\nZM announced a couple of new features. One is the \u201cOnZoom\u201d , which allow users to sell tickets for their Zoom calls, so they can teach classes, hold concerts etc. for a profit. Basically, ZM is moving into the paid live streaming business. The other new thing is \u201cZapps\u201d, apps that run inside Zoom. For example Slack, now you no longer need to open Slack in parallel to Zoom, you can simply use Slack inside Zoom (with reduced functionality). **So basically, this saves you a couple mouse clicks** when conferencing. These announcements are certainly positive. The company would do better with them than without. But just how much better? Just a reminder, no matter how fancy the new features are, if they don\u2019t help make money, they would not matter at all. So let\u2019s think about how much money will these new features help Zoom make.\n\n# Long $ZM has become a new pandemic\n\nOn Wednesday, I was watching the analyst\u2019s call, via the Zoom link they provided. There were quite several ass-kissing questions, like what is Zoom\u2019s culture, philosophy, futures of our world blah blah. One practical question finally appears, when an analyst asked about **how Zoom plans to monetize on the new OnZoom and Zapps feature**. And the CFO\u2019s answer was, \u201c**This is new. We are not sure. We are looking at it. We will probably find out in next several quarters**.\u201d FYI, **Zoom is not taking a cut from the ticket sales. (**[**https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360050178332#h\\_01EMH8B5ND84F6XSSTPVKY75E7**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360050178332#h_01EMH8B5ND84F6XSSTPVKY75E7)**)** There is no evidence Zoom will take a cut in the future. **There is no evidence Zoom will charge third-parties to develop Zapps either**.\n\nHmm, Ms. CFO, you are not telling us much, How much money on earth are your new features worth?\n\n**When the profitability is an uncertainty to the company\u2019s own insider CFO, it has not been an uncertainty to the financial analysts**. A slew of analysts upgraded their target prices. RBC upgraded from 450 to 600. D.A Davidson upgraded from 457 to 600. And **Berstein, they upgraded from 228 to 612, a stunning 383$ per share increase, or a 75 billion dollar increase in valuation** (ZM has about 200mil shares outstanding). Ok folks WOW. In a professional analyst's opinion, **An online ticketing feature, plus an app feature that pretty much only saves you a couple of mouse clicks, are worth 75 billion USD**. Hey, remember how much money Oracle offered to buy TikTok? 20 billion.

Fastly down 30%+ after a revenue warning. And Zoom rose to a record after its Zoomtopia analyst event. The year of 2020 has once again amazed me. I guess I \u2018m getting old.\n\nFastly reports preliminary Q3 revenue 70-71 mil, which is 5.6% lower than estimated 74.7 mil (Bloomberg number). This 5.6% drop in revenue triggered a 31% selloff, but I was not surprised about that. I knew this would happen one day. As I quote a [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/fastly-plunge-is-reminder-of-valuation-excesses-in-software) \u201cFastly\u2019s slowdown highlights the precariousness of lofty software valuations. **Massive share plunges are the price paid when these businesses fall short of perfection**.\u201d Exactly, **a perfect dream is destined to end in our imperfect world**.\n\n**Even though the FSLY lesson has come out, investors are not learning anything at all.**\n\n# Zoomtopia\n\nZM\u2019s meteoric rise surprised me. Ahead of the Zoomtopia event, on Monday, ZM\u2019s price was 491.54. Today it traded at a high of 563, a 14%+ rise. So what happened on the Zoomtopia event that has caused such a ZM euphoria?\n\nZM announced a couple of new features. One is the \u201cOnZoom\u201d , which allow users to sell tickets for their Zoom calls, so they can teach classes, hold concerts etc. for a profit. Basically, ZM is moving into the paid live streaming business. The other new thing is \u201cZapps\u201d, apps that run inside Zoom. For example Slack, now you no longer need to open Slack in parallel to Zoom, you can simply use Slack inside Zoom (with reduced functionality). **So basically, this saves you a couple mouse clicks** when conferencing. These announcements are certainly positive. The company would do better with them than without. But just how much better? Just a reminder, no matter how fancy the new features are, if they don\u2019t help make money, they would not matter at all. So let\u2019s think about how much money will these new features help Zoom make.\n\n# Long $ZM has become a new pandemic\n\nOn Wednesday, I was watching the analyst\u2019s call, via the Zoom link they provided. There were quite several ass-kissing questions, like what is Zoom\u2019s culture, philosophy, futures of our world blah blah. One practical question finally appears, when an analyst asked about **how Zoom plans to monetize on the new OnZoom and Zapps feature**. And the CFO\u2019s answer was, \u201c**This is new. We are not sure. We are looking at it. We will probably find out in next several quarters**.\u201d FYI, **Zoom is not taking a cut from the ticket sales. (**[**https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360050178332#h\\_01EMH8B5ND84F6XSSTPVKY75E7**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360050178332#h_01EMH8B5ND84F6XSSTPVKY75E7)**)** There is no evidence Zoom will take a cut in the future. **There is no evidence Zoom will charge third-parties to develop Zapps either**.\n\nHmm, Ms. CFO, you are not telling us much, How much money on earth are your new features worth?\n\n**When the profitability is an uncertainty to the company\u2019s own insider CFO, it has not been an uncertainty to the financial analysts**. A slew of analysts upgraded their target prices. RBC upgraded from 450 to 600. D.A Davidson upgraded from 457 to 600. And **Berstein, they upgraded from 228 to 612, a stunning 383$ per share increase, or a 75 billion dollar increase in valuation** (ZM has about 200mil shares outstanding). Ok folks WOW. In a professional analyst's opinion, **An online ticketing feature, plus an app feature that pretty much only saves you a couple of mouse clicks, are worth 75 billion USD**. Hey, remember how much money Oracle offered to buy TikTok? 20 billion. This values TikTok at about $50b ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bytedance-tiktok-exclusive-idUSKCN24U1M9](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bytedance-tiktok-exclusive-idUSKCN24U1M9))  **One Zoomtopia event, just pumped ZM\u2019s valuation by 1.5x TikTok.**\n\nIf Ms. CFO does not tell us how much more money ZM expect to make.

In addition, Europe now accounts for about one-third of new cases reported worldwide ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/world/europe/europe-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage)). This has led to a flurry of new mitigation measures, including strict 9pm-6am curfew for Paris and eight other big French cities ([FT](https://www.ft.com/content/e3e6d790-c767-4d07-a158-cb2e8d5a5899)), and Londoners prohibited from mixing with other households beginning this weekend ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-15/london-households-will-be-banned-from-mixing-as-rules-tightened?sref=L75TRUmI)). However, countries are still trying to avoid the more draconian measures seen in the initial phase of the pandemic ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/europe-covid-restrictions-lockdown-second-wave-fbb4952a-632c-4b83-9e8d-c9ab5e2aff82.html)). In the US, new cases rose above 59K, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with several Midwestern states reporting elevated levels in recent days ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-latest-updates-10-15-2020-11602749198)). The seven-day average of 51,038 as of Tuesday was also the highest since mid-August, while hospitalizations were at the highest level since 28-Aug as of Wednesday.\n\n**Stimulus skepticism:**\n\n* Multiple reports in recent days have flagged the heightened skepticism surrounding the prospects for a bipartisan agreement on a fifth coronavirus relief package before the election. While the gap between the proposals from House Democrats ($2.2T) and White House ($1.8T) has narrowed to just \\~$400B, there continue to be myriad stumbling blocks.

In addition, Europe now accounts for about one-third of new cases reported worldwide ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/world/europe/europe-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage)). This has led to a flurry of new mitigation measures, including strict 9pm-6am curfew for Paris and eight other big French cities ([FT](https://www.ft.com/content/e3e6d790-c767-4d07-a158-cb2e8d5a5899)), and Londoners prohibited from mixing with other households beginning this weekend ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-15/london-households-will-be-banned-from-mixing-as-rules-tightened?sref=L75TRUmI)).

Said he will stop negotiating until after the election, expecting that he will pass a major stimulus bill after he is reelected. Added Senate Majority Leader McConnell should focus on upcoming confirmation hearings for his SCOTUS nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. Abrupt end to stimulus talks comes after a weeks-long back and forth between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin that did not seem to be closing the gap between Democrats' offer and the White House's $1.6T. Pelosi criticized Trump's move, saying it shows the White House is in complete disarray. However, still a lot of focus on whether more stimulus could come in January in the event Democrats win the White House and control in the Senate.\n\n**Most sectors lower with big tech, energy the big underperformers:**\n\n* Pullback in FAANG names after a strong session Monday was a weight on **consumer discretionary**, **communication services**, and **tech**. Entertainment, homebuilders, retail/apparel were some of the other drags in these sectors. **Energy** another underperformer despite another big day for crude (WTI up almost 10% this week). **Healthcare** just beat the tape, helped by a smattering of gainers among MedTech. **Materials** was largely down, but sector had some support from select chemical firms. Airlines were a weight on **industrials**, but machinery was mixed. **Financials** saw credit cards down but regional banks were not so bad overall. **Consumer staples** saw some help from HPCs. **Utilities** was the only sector in the green.\n\n**Trump says will hit campaign trail soon, will participate in next week's debate:**\n\n* President Trump said today he would be back on the campaign trail soon, while his campaign said that he intends to be ready to participate in the second presidential debate scheduled for Thursday, 15-Oct in Miami ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/trump-looking-forward-to-second-debate-with-biden-after-covid-diagnosis.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain)). [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-06/trump-is-considering-televised-speech-after-return-from-hospital?srnd=premium) reported Trump wants to return to the Oval Office today, and while some aides don't want the president to leave the residence, they're unsure how long he'll continue to isolate himself. Elsewhere, General Milley, top US military official, among members of Joint Chiefs of Staff in self-quarantine after Coast Guard's vice commandant tested positive ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-06/military-s-chief-to-quarantine-after-an-admiral-tests-positive?srnd=premium&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B)). Comes after President Trump was discharged from Walter Reed Medical Center on Monday evening and returned to the White House, tweeted a video in which he said he was feeling better and urged Americans not to be afraid of the coronavirus. Trump's physician today said the president reported no symptoms after first night back at White House.\n\n**Powell cautiously optimistic, again makes case for further support:**\n\n* No big surprises from Fed Chair Powell's [keynote speech](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20201006a.htm) at the NABE annual conference today. Noted combination of fiscal and monetary actions have for now muted recessionary dynamics, but cautioned outlook remains highly uncertain due to the coronavirus. Warned about risk rapid reopening gains could transition to a longer-than-expected slog back, noting in particular increase in permanent job losses. Suggested risks of policy intervention are asymmetric, with too little leading to unnecessary hardship while relief that proves greater than needed will still not go to waste. His comments on monetary policy and forward guidance were tightly in line with recent Fed pronouncements and broke no new ground.\n\n**Biden 16 points ahead of Trump in new national poll:**\n\n* [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/politics/cnn-poll-biden-trump-2020-election/index.html) said that a new nationwide CNN Poll conducted by SSRS showed that Joe Biden's advantage over President Trump has widened to 16 points, his largest of the cycle. The prior survey at the beginning of September showed Biden with an 8-point lead. Report noted that similar to a recently released WSJ-NBC News poll, the CNN poll suggests Biden likely received a bump from the first presidential debate. However, it also pointed out that the poll does not show any meaningful pullback in support for Trump. It said Trump's core backers remain as supportive of him as they have been, if not more. It also stressed that the election will ultimately come down to a handful of swing stakes, where Biden has a narrower lead. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-battlegrounds-poll/reuters-ipsos-poll-shows-biden-leading-in-pennsylvania-wisconsin-idUSKBN26Q2ZT) said Reuters/Ipsos polls out on Monday showed Biden 5 points ahead of Trump in Pennsylvania and 6 points ahead in Wisconsin, while today's [Monmouth](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_pa_100620.pdf/) poll showed Biden holding a 12-point lead across registered voters in Pennsylvania.\n\n**White House agrees to FDA guidance for two-month vaccine followup:**\n\n* The US FDA today released expected [guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download) saying that data from phase 3 studies for coronavirus vaccine candidates should include two months of follow-up data in order to qualify for emergency use authorization (EUA), meaning it is most likely a vaccine will not be cleared for use until after the 3-Nov presidential election. Recall that the Trump administration had voiced objections to the FDA's likely guidance, with Trump himself saying the FDA needed to move quickly and hinting he \"may or may not\" approve such guidance, saying it seemed like a political move. However, the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-agrees-to-fdas-guidelines-for-vetting-covid-19-vaccines-11602011953) reported today that the White House has endorsed the guidelines. For its part, the FDA said it hoped the guidance will help the public understand that its practices help ensure quality, safety, and efficacy for any vaccine it authorizes.\n\n**Democrats on House panel to recommend measures that could make it easier to break up big tech platforms:**\n\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/05/gop-democrats-tech-antitrust-proposals-426528) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-05/house-panel-to-recommend-breakup-of-tech-giants-republican-says?srnd=premium&amp;sref=L75TRUmI) reported that Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee are poised to propose sweeping reforms that could make it easier to break up big tech platforms. However, these proposals have already been previewed by Representative David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat leading the investigation. He said back in August that his panel's inquiry confirmed Google (GOOGL-US ), Apple (AAPL-US ), Amazon (AMZN-US ) and Facebook (FB-US ) are abusing their market power to crush competitors and Congress needs to respond. Republican Representative Ken Buck of Colorado said that while he agrees with Cicilline on the need to rein in the power of big tech and provide more resources for antitrust enforcers, the more aggressive proposals like legislation creating structural separation are \"non-starters\" for Republicans. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/scoop-house-dems-briefing-biden-team-on-tech-antitrust-report-843b1d7d-fbc1-43b4-b425-96bcc872bd93.html) also reported House Judiciary Democrats to brief Biden's team today.\n\n**Central banks focused on need for fiscal stimulus but face decisions on QE:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-cenbanks/mid-recovery-coronavirus-spreading-global-central-bankers-take-stock-idUSKBN26R0JS) discussed how leading central bankers are expected to continue to stress the need for additional fiscal policy support to cushion the global economy from the coronavirus pandemic. However, it also pointed out that the Fed, ECB and BOJ all face decisions in the coming weeks over their next crisis-fighting measures, particularly when it comes to the question of whether and how to expand the amounts and types of assets they are buying each month. One of the disappointments coming out of the September FOMC meeting was that while the Fed tweaked the QE rationale to include helping to foster accommodative financial conditions, it did not adjust the size or composition of the asset purchase program. The Fed's Mester said on Monday she does not see a current need for more bond buying (Fed's Evans was also cautious last week) but wants the option to extend duration.", false, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 868043, "public", "self", "Top Stories - Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2020", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j6chyx/top_stories_tuesday_oct_6_2020/", "all_ads", 6, 1602011270.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "spacej3di", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_kdm2ull", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1602014870, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j6chyx/top_stories_tuesday_oct_6_2020/", "gildings": {}, "id": "j6chyx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "resources", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "a376614c-65e6-11e5-b6e7-123c7cc7e97b", "link_flair_text": "Resources", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/j6chyx/top_stories_tuesday_oct_6_2020/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Ptp7NpWYrlVad3rOJ1SZRbeyyLhs1-ReJ7rOaKgyQrs", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kNn-VUL_WDT2fli5KjAY1_sfQ9UUFDD-62N_yt6iQ-4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c031fb0494affe012dc3651121742690d35a49ab", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kNn-VUL_WDT2fli5KjAY1_sfQ9UUFDD-62N_yt6iQ-4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e7d9e9531981df6a1bbee0deff47372d0633251", "width": 216}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kNn-VUL_WDT2fli5KjAY1_sfQ9UUFDD-62N_yt6iQ-4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=127b51ab3933b005daa4bf19ca1b5099f828bfd1", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 400, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kNn-VUL_WDT2fli5KjAY1_sfQ9UUFDD-62N_yt6iQ-4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d6d70346b02c13e65b977992ffa9f82e4af5d161", "width": 400}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1602014880, "score": 1, "selftext": "Summarized to save you time.\n\n**Trump says he is done negotiating with Democrats over stimulus:**\n\n* President Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1313551794623127552) he has rejected House Speaker Pelosi's $2.4T proposal for a fifth round of coronavirus stimulus, suggesting much of the amount would be used to bail out Democratic-run states.

However, still a lot of focus on whether more stimulus could come in January in the event Democrats win the White House and control in the Senate.\n\n**Most sectors lower with big tech, energy the big underperformers:**\n\n* Pullback in FAANG names after a strong session Monday was a weight on **consumer discretionary**, **communication services**, and **tech**. Entertainment, homebuilders, retail/apparel were some of the other drags in these sectors. **Energy** another underperformer despite another big day for crude (WTI up almost 10% this week). **Healthcare** just beat the tape, helped by a smattering of gainers among MedTech. **Materials** was largely down, but sector had some support from select chemical firms. Airlines were a weight on **industrials**, but machinery was mixed. **Financials** saw credit cards down but regional banks were not so bad overall. **Consumer staples** saw some help from HPCs. **Utilities** was the only sector in the green.\n\n**Trump says will hit campaign trail soon, will participate in next week's debate:**\n\n* President Trump said today he would be back on the campaign trail soon, while his campaign said that he intends to be ready to participate in the second presidential debate scheduled for Thursday, 15-Oct in Miami ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/trump-looking-forward-to-second-debate-with-biden-after-covid-diagnosis.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain)). [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-06/trump-is-considering-televised-speech-after-return-from-hospital?srnd=premium) reported Trump wants to return to the Oval Office today, and while some aides don't want the president to leave the residence, they're unsure how long he'll continue to isolate himself. Elsewhere, General Milley, top US military official, among members of Joint Chiefs of Staff in self-quarantine after Coast Guard's vice commandant tested positive ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-06/military-s-chief-to-quarantine-after-an-admiral-tests-positive?srnd=premium&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B)). Comes after President Trump was discharged from Walter Reed Medical Center on Monday evening and returned to the White House, tweeted a video in which he said he was feeling better and urged Americans not to be afraid of the coronavirus. Trump's physician today said the president reported no symptoms after first night back at White House.\n\n**Powell cautiously optimistic, again makes case for further support:**\n\n* No big surprises from Fed Chair Powell's [keynote speech](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20201006a.htm) at the NABE annual conference today. Noted combination of fiscal and monetary actions have for now muted recessionary dynamics, but cautioned outlook remains highly uncertain due to the coronavirus. Warned about risk rapid reopening gains could transition to a longer-than-expected slog back, noting in particular increase in permanent job losses. Suggested risks of policy intervention are asymmetric, with too little leading to unnecessary hardship while relief that proves greater than needed will still not go to waste. His comments on monetary policy and forward guidance were tightly in line with recent Fed pronouncements and broke no new ground.\n\n**Biden 16 points ahead of Trump in new national poll:**\n\n* [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/politics/cnn-poll-biden-trump-2020-election/index.html) said that a new nationwide CNN Poll conducted by SSRS showed that Joe Biden's advantage over President Trump has widened to 16 points, his largest of the cycle. The prior survey at the beginning of September showed Biden with an 8-point lead. Report noted that similar to a recently released WSJ-NBC News poll, the CNN poll suggests Biden likely received a bump from the first presidential debate. However, it also pointed out that the poll does not show any meaningful pullback in support for Trump. It said Trump's core backers remain as supportive of him as they have been, if not more. It also stressed that the election will ultimately come down to a handful of swing stakes, where Biden has a narrower lead. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-battlegrounds-poll/reuters-ipsos-poll-shows-biden-leading-in-pennsylvania-wisconsin-idUSKBN26Q2ZT) said Reuters/Ipsos polls out on Monday showed Biden 5 points ahead of Trump in Pennsylvania and 6 points ahead in Wisconsin, while today's [Monmouth](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_pa_100620.pdf/) poll showed Biden holding a 12-point lead across registered voters in Pennsylvania.\n\n**White House agrees to FDA guidance for two-month vaccine followup:**\n\n* The US FDA today released expected [guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download) saying that data from phase 3 studies for coronavirus vaccine candidates should include two months of follow-up data in order to qualify for emergency use authorization (EUA), meaning it is most likely a vaccine will not be cleared for use until after the 3-Nov presidential election. Recall that the Trump administration had voiced objections to the FDA's likely guidance, with Trump himself saying the FDA needed to move quickly and hinting he \"may or may not\" approve such guidance, saying it seemed like a political move. However, the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-agrees-to-fdas-guidelines-for-vetting-covid-19-vaccines-11602011953) reported today that the White House has endorsed the guidelines. For its part, the FDA said it hoped the guidance will help the public understand that its practices help ensure quality, safety, and efficacy for any vaccine it authorizes.\n\n**Democrats on House panel to recommend measures that could make it easier to break up big tech platforms:**\n\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/05/gop-democrats-tech-antitrust-proposals-426528) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-05/house-panel-to-recommend-breakup-of-tech-giants-republican-says?srnd=premium&amp;sref=L75TRUmI) reported that Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee are poised to propose sweeping reforms that could make it easier to break up big tech platforms. However, these proposals have already been previewed by Representative David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat leading the investigation. He said back in August that his panel's inquiry confirmed Google (GOOGL-US ), Apple (AAPL-US ), Amazon (AMZN-US ) and Facebook (FB-US ) are abusing their market power to crush competitors and Congress needs to respond. Republican Representative Ken Buck of Colorado said that while he agrees with Cicilline on the need to rein in the power of big tech and provide more resources for antitrust enforcers, the more aggressive proposals like legislation creating structural separation are \"non-starters\" for Republicans. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/scoop-house-dems-briefing-biden-team-on-tech-antitrust-report-843b1d7d-fbc1-43b4-b425-96bcc872bd93.html) also reported House Judiciary Democrats to brief Biden's team today.\n\n**Central banks focused on need for fiscal stimulus but face decisions on QE:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-cenbanks/mid-recovery-coronavirus-spreading-global-central-bankers-take-stock-idUSKBN26R0JS) discussed how leading central bankers are expected to continue to stress the need for additional fiscal policy support to cushion the global economy from the coronavirus pandemic. However, it also pointed out that the Fed, ECB and BOJ all face decisions in the coming weeks over their next crisis-fighting measures, particularly when it comes to the question of whether and how to expand the amounts and types of assets they are buying each month. One of the disappointments coming out of the September FOMC meeting was that while the Fed tweaked the QE rationale to include helping to foster accommodative financial conditions, it did not adjust the size or composition of the asset purchase program. The Fed's Mester said on Monday she does not see a current need for more bond buying (Fed's Evans was also cautious last week) but wants the option to extend duration.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 868043, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Top Stories - Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2020", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j6chyx/top_stories_tuesday_oct_6_2020/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1602011270.0}], [[], false, "BuzzLima", null, [], null, "text", "t2_dc1lukl", false, false, [], false, false, 1602004661, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j695zq/imtx_immatics_granted_patent_for_immunotherapy/", {}, "j695zq", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 0, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/j695zq/imtx_immatics_granted_patent_for_immunotherapy/", false, 6, 1602004673, 1, "Immatics granted patent for immunotherapy against several tumors The United States Patent and Trademark Office posted on its website a patent granted to Immatics for an immunotherapy against several tumors. \n\n**Reference** \n\nPatent\n\nImmunotherapy against several tumors including gastrointestinal and gastric cancer\n\nGrant US-9101585-B2\n\nAbstract\n\nThe present invention relates to peptides, nucleic acids and cells for use in immunotherapeutic methods.

Rising odds of fiscal stimulus with Dem sweep were also increasingly in focus. Economists from Goldman Sachs upgraded their US forecasts on a higher probability of a stimulus of at least $2T shortly after 20-Jan inauguration. There was also optimism from White House over agreement on stimulus as soon as this week (though bipartisan deal still faces a number of headwinds). Rates were also higher with curve steepening on some of today's election themes given potential impact of borrowing, inflationary pressure around massive stimulus. JPMorgan strategists also downplayed potential tax increases, arguing they'd be watered down given current economic conditions. Other ongoing tailwinds included monetary policy, vaccine optimism, resilient corporate profits.\n\n**All sectors finish higher, with energy, tech, healthcare the leaders:**\n\n* **Energy** led the market amid big WTI gains with refiners, services among best groups. **Tech** beat the tape on gains across semis, hardware. **Healthcare** was an outperformer with biotech getting a boost from M&amp;A tailwind, while managed care also extending recent gains on lower perceived threat from a Biden administration. **Materials** was ahead on strength in industrial metals, chemicals (lithium names in particular). **Industrials** was a slight underperformer with machinery, trucking better but some weakness in airlines. **Communications services** stocks were broadly higher, but telecom performance was more moderate. Homebuilders, restaurants were among the drags on **consumer discretionary**. **Financials** saw some outperformance by banks, but some softness in exchanges, online brokers. **Consumer staples** saw scattered decliners in beverages, HPCs. **REITs** trailed the market.\n\n**Trump leaving hospital this evening:**\n\n* President Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313186529058136070) he will leave Walter Reed Medical Center today. Members of his medical team said Trump has been fever-free for 72 hours, has been ambulating, and has no respiratory complaints. Added while he may not be entirely out of the woods, the team agrees that his clinical status supports returning home to the White House. Said discussions had taken place about precautions for the president to follow as he does his work. Trump has been treated with Gilead's (GILD-US ) remdesivir and will receive a final dose tomorrow at the White House. Also received a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies by Regeneron (REGN-US ) and the steroid dexamethasone, which is typically used for the sickest COVID-19 patients.\n\n**Trump calls for swift action on stimulus, Pelosi says progress being made:**\n\n* President Trump on Saturday urged Congress to move swiftly on fiscal stimulus. [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/10/03/trump-coronavirus-stimulus-package/) noted White House officials have privately expressed confidence the outlines of a deal could come to fruition by the middle of the week. House Speaker Pelosi said on Sunday that lawmakers \"making progress\" but flagged significant disagreement in key areas such as unemployment, schools, and state and local funding, the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, testing and tracing, and appropriations. Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin reported to have spoken for an hour today and will exchange proposals in advance of another phone call tomorrow ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress-idUSKBN26Q1EG?taid=5f7b76d32e33a1000143489a&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter)). Recall Democrats passed a $2.2T bill last week while White House recently offered a $1.6T package. Note House and Senate are both currently out of session.\n\n**September ISM services surprised higher on new order strength:**\n\n* **ISM services index** for September of 57.8 beat 56.3 estimate, up from prior month 56.9. Business activity index up 0.6 at 63, new orders index up 4.7 at 61.5, employment index up 3.9 at 51.8. Prices, supplier deliveries, backlog of orders, and new export orders growth all decelerated rather sharply while inventory sentiment increased more quickly. Elsewhere, September **Markit services** PMI at 54.6, unchanged from flash reading and down slightly from August's 55. New sales, selling prices, and foreign client demand grew more quickly with employment, backlog of orders, input costs also strong. Employers noted an increase in PPE prices. Business confidence fell to a four-month low.\n\n**Post-debate polls show Biden with solid lead over Trump:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-scores-14-point-lead-over-trump-in-poll-after-debate-11601816400)/NBC News poll showed Joe Biden leading President Trump 53-39% among registered voters, up on a 8-point lead in last month's poll. Survey found evidence last week's presidential debate had a material effect on Trump's political standing. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll/biden-leads-by-10-points-as-majority-of-americans-say-trump-could-have-avoided-coronavirus-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN26P0DB) poll showed Biden leading 51-41%, his biggest advantage in a month. Survey showed little indication Trump garnered an outpouring of support beyond his base after being diagnosed with coronavirus. Majority of Americans felt Trump could have avoided infection if he took coronavirus more seriously. Other surveys show Biden leading or tied in key battleground states. [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/03/upshot/polls-election-florida-pennsylvania.html)/Sienna College poll had Biden leading by seven points in Pennsylvania and five in Florida. [CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-trump-opinion-poll-ohio-pennsylvania-mail-voting-10-04-2020/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&amp;linkId=101150747) Battleground Tracker poll showed Trump and Biden neck-and-neck in Ohio.\n\n**Big tech stocks among most vulnerable to a corporate tax increase from Democratic sweep:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-stock-markets-leaders-appear-most-vulnerable-to-bidens-tax-plan-11601803801) noted that according to estimates from BofA, the tax increases that could result from a Democratic sweep in November would cut S&amp;P 500 earnings by 9.2%. Added that the drag would be most severe for the tech, communications services and consumer discretionary sectors that are home to Apple (AAPL-US ), Microsoft (MSFT-US ), Alphabet (GOOGL-US ), Facebook (FB-US ) and Amazon (AMZN-US ). Also discussed how tax headwinds on those big tech stocks could have broader market implications given index concentration dynamics and the extent to which they have driven the rally since the coronavirus lows in March. Big fiscal stimulus could also unleash a rotation to value and cyclicals. However, big tech still expected to benefit from its outsized leverage to the secular growth, secular disruption and central bank liquidity tailwind themes.\n\n**Recession-level job cuts now being seen in industries not directly impacted by pandemic:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/03/upshot/pandemic-economy-recession.html?action=click&amp;module=Well&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;section=The%20Upshot) discussed how even if you exclude the sectors directly affected the pandemic, the number of jobs in the US is 4.6% lower in September than in February. Noted that is close to the 5.3% contraction in total employment that took place during the entire 18 months of the Great Recession and roughly three times worse than what was seen in the 2001 recession. Highlighted the mechanical effect of shutdowns in large parts of the economy. Also pointed out that is often the case in recessions, the pandemic has led many companies accelerate restructuring efforts that were already underway. According to Morgan Stanley, companies cut COGS and SG&amp;A by 5.4% in Q2. Paper said that this scarring suggests that even as the reopening gains traction and vaccines get closer, the economy is unlikely to see a rapid snapback to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n**Bets on steeper yield curve hit record level:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-05/record-shorts-show-new-bets-on-steeper-treasury-yield-curve?sref=L75TRUmI) noted that speculative bets against longer-dated Treasuries have hit a record high, suggesting that investors are getting more aggressive in their positioning for a steeper yield curve. Net short speculative positions in long bond futures saw biggest weekly increase since 2007 to \\~209K contracts, while net long positions on 10-year Treasuries have risen to their highest since October 2017. Article discussed how steepeners are often seen as bets on reflation. This fits with the pickup in expectations for a Democratic sweep in November that could unleash more meaningful fiscal stimulus. Steepeners also play into expectations for bigger deficits. Report did not highlight expectations by some strategists that the Fed will ultimately implement a yield curve control strategy to dampen upward pressure on long-term bond yields.\n\n**What's on tap for the week?:**\n\n* This week looks pretty quiet from a calendar perspective (particularly the corporate calendar). **Fed Chair Powell speaks on Tuesday** but it seems unlikely he will deviate much from the messaging at the September FOMC press conference. The **September FOMC minutes are out on Wednesday** and there is likely to be some outsized scrutiny surrounding any discussion regarding changes to the QE program given some of the recent pickup in \"peak Fed\" concerns. The **vice-presidential debate is on Wednesday** **night** and takes on increased importance given the coronavirus developments. The House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee is expected to release its report on **antitrust allegations against big tech**, while the Justice Department's widely previewed **antitrust lawsuit against Google** may hit late in the week.\n\n**NYC to close public schools and nonessential businesses in Queens and Brooklyn amid rise in coronavirus infections:**\n\n* NYC Mayor de Blasio announced Sunday public schools and nonessential businesses in Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods will close from Wednesday pending approval from the state ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-to-close-schools-in-some-neighborhoods-due-to-rising-covid-cases-11601829614?st=i1dt5ze2czsuhln&amp;reflink=article_email_share)). Neighborhoods in those areas have logged positive rates above 3% for seven consecutive days, compared to seven-day average positive rate of 1.72% for the city overall. US recorded 50K new cases on Saturday, marking first back-to-back increases of 50K+ since mid-August ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-latest-news-10-04-2020-11601797204)). Seven-day average of new cases higher than 14-day average in 31 states, up from 29 on Friday. Meanwhile, several states in Midwest and West are reporting record-high hospitalizations ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/03/coronavirus-hospitalizations-grow-in-the-midwest-amid-climbing-cases.html)).

Other ongoing tailwinds included monetary policy, vaccine optimism, resilient corporate profits.\n\n**All sectors finish higher, with energy, tech, healthcare the leaders:**\n\n* **Energy** led the market amid big WTI gains with refiners, services among best groups. **Tech** beat the tape on gains across semis, hardware. **Healthcare** was an outperformer with biotech getting a boost from M&amp;A tailwind, while managed care also extending recent gains on lower perceived threat from a Biden administration. **Materials** was ahead on strength in industrial metals, chemicals (lithium names in particular). **Industrials** was a slight underperformer with machinery, trucking better but some weakness in airlines. **Communications services** stocks were broadly higher, but telecom performance was more moderate. Homebuilders, restaurants were among the drags on **consumer discretionary**. **Financials** saw some outperformance by banks, but some softness in exchanges, online brokers. **Consumer staples** saw scattered decliners in beverages, HPCs. **REITs** trailed the market.\n\n**Trump leaving hospital this evening:**\n\n* President Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313186529058136070) he will leave Walter Reed Medical Center today. Members of his medical team said Trump has been fever-free for 72 hours, has been ambulating, and has no respiratory complaints. Added while he may not be entirely out of the woods, the team agrees that his clinical status supports returning home to the White House. Said discussions had taken place about precautions for the president to follow as he does his work. Trump has been treated with Gilead's (GILD-US ) remdesivir and will receive a final dose tomorrow at the White House. Also received a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies by Regeneron (REGN-US ) and the steroid dexamethasone, which is typically used for the sickest COVID-19 patients.\n\n**Trump calls for swift action on stimulus, Pelosi says progress being made:**\n\n* President Trump on Saturday urged Congress to move swiftly on fiscal stimulus. [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/10/03/trump-coronavirus-stimulus-package/) noted White House officials have privately expressed confidence the outlines of a deal could come to fruition by the middle of the week. House Speaker Pelosi said on Sunday that lawmakers \"making progress\" but flagged significant disagreement in key areas such as unemployment, schools, and state and local funding, the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, testing and tracing, and appropriations. Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin reported to have spoken for an hour today and will exchange proposals in advance of another phone call tomorrow ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress-idUSKBN26Q1EG?taid=5f7b76d32e33a1000143489a&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter)). Recall Democrats passed a $2.2T bill last week while White House recently offered a $1.6T package. Note House and Senate are both currently out of session.\n\n**September ISM services surprised higher on new order strength:**\n\n* **ISM services index** for September of 57.8 beat 56.3 estimate, up from prior month 56.9. Business activity index up 0.6 at 63, new orders index up 4.7 at 61.5, employment index up 3.9 at 51.8. Prices, supplier deliveries, backlog of orders, and new export orders growth all decelerated rather sharply while inventory sentiment increased more quickly. Elsewhere, September **Markit services** PMI at 54.6, unchanged from flash reading and down slightly from August's 55. New sales, selling prices, and foreign client demand grew more quickly with employment, backlog of orders, input costs also strong. Employers noted an increase in PPE prices. Business confidence fell to a four-month low.\n\n**Post-debate polls show Biden with solid lead over Trump:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-scores-14-point-lead-over-trump-in-poll-after-debate-11601816400)/NBC News poll showed Joe Biden leading President Trump 53-39% among registered voters, up on a 8-point lead in last month's poll. Survey found evidence last week's presidential debate had a material effect on Trump's political standing. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll/biden-leads-by-10-points-as-majority-of-americans-say-trump-could-have-avoided-coronavirus-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN26P0DB) poll showed Biden leading 51-41%, his biggest advantage in a month. Survey showed little indication Trump garnered an outpouring of support beyond his base after being diagnosed with coronavirus. Majority of Americans felt Trump could have avoided infection if he took coronavirus more seriously. Other surveys show Biden leading or tied in key battleground states. [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/03/upshot/polls-election-florida-pennsylvania.html)/Sienna College poll had Biden leading by seven points in Pennsylvania and five in Florida. [CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-trump-opinion-poll-ohio-pennsylvania-mail-voting-10-04-2020/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&amp;linkId=101150747) Battleground Tracker poll showed Trump and Biden neck-and-neck in Ohio.\n\n**Big tech stocks among most vulnerable to a corporate tax increase from Democratic sweep:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-stock-markets-leaders-appear-most-vulnerable-to-bidens-tax-plan-11601803801) noted that according to estimates from BofA, the tax increases that could result from a Democratic sweep in November would cut S&amp;P 500 earnings by 9.2%. Added that the drag would be most severe for the tech, communications services and consumer discretionary sectors that are home to Apple (AAPL-US ), Microsoft (MSFT-US ), Alphabet (GOOGL-US ), Facebook (FB-US ) and Amazon (AMZN-US ). Also discussed how tax headwinds on those big tech stocks could have broader market implications given index concentration dynamics and the extent to which they have driven the rally since the coronavirus lows in March. Big fiscal stimulus could also unleash a rotation to value and cyclicals. However, big tech still expected to benefit from its outsized leverage to the secular growth, secular disruption and central bank liquidity tailwind themes.\n\n**Recession-level job cuts now being seen in industries not directly impacted by pandemic:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/03/upshot/pandemic-economy-recession.html?action=click&amp;module=Well&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;section=The%20Upshot) discussed how even if you exclude the sectors directly affected the pandemic, the number of jobs in the US is 4.6% lower in September than in February. Noted that is close to the 5.3% contraction in total employment that took place during the entire 18 months of the Great Recession and roughly three times worse than what was seen in the 2001 recession. Highlighted the mechanical effect of shutdowns in large parts of the economy. Also pointed out that is often the case in recessions, the pandemic has led many companies accelerate restructuring efforts that were already underway. According to Morgan Stanley, companies cut COGS and SG&amp;A by 5.4% in Q2. Paper said that this scarring suggests that even as the reopening gains traction and vaccines get closer, the economy is unlikely to see a rapid snapback to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n**Bets on steeper yield curve hit record level:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-05/record-shorts-show-new-bets-on-steeper-treasury-yield-curve?sref=L75TRUmI) noted that speculative bets against longer-dated Treasuries have hit a record high, suggesting that investors are getting more aggressive in their positioning for a steeper yield curve. Net short speculative positions in long bond futures saw biggest weekly increase since 2007 to \\~209K contracts, while net long positions on 10-year Treasuries have risen to their highest since October 2017. Article discussed how steepeners are often seen as bets on reflation. This fits with the pickup in expectations for a Democratic sweep in November that could unleash more meaningful fiscal stimulus. Steepeners also play into expectations for bigger deficits. Report did not highlight expectations by some strategists that the Fed will ultimately implement a yield curve control strategy to dampen upward pressure on long-term bond yields.\n\n**What's on tap for the week?:**\n\n* This week looks pretty quiet from a calendar perspective (particularly the corporate calendar). **Fed Chair Powell speaks on Tuesday** but it seems unlikely he will deviate much from the messaging at the September FOMC press conference. The **September FOMC minutes are out on Wednesday** and there is likely to be some outsized scrutiny surrounding any discussion regarding changes to the QE program given some of the recent pickup in \"peak Fed\" concerns. The **vice-presidential debate is on Wednesday** **night** and takes on increased importance given the coronavirus developments. The House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee is expected to release its report on **antitrust allegations against big tech**, while the Justice Department's widely previewed **antitrust lawsuit against Google** may hit late in the week.\n\n**NYC to close public schools and nonessential businesses in Queens and Brooklyn amid rise in coronavirus infections:**\n\n* NYC Mayor de Blasio announced Sunday public schools and nonessential businesses in Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods will close from Wednesday pending approval from the state ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-to-close-schools-in-some-neighborhoods-due-to-rising-covid-cases-11601829614?st=i1dt5ze2czsuhln&amp;reflink=article_email_share)). Neighborhoods in those areas have logged positive rates above 3% for seven consecutive days, compared to seven-day average positive rate of 1.72% for the city overall. US recorded 50K new cases on Saturday, marking first back-to-back increases of 50K+ since mid-August ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-latest-news-10-04-2020-11601797204)). Seven-day average of new cases higher than 14-day average in 31 states, up from 29 on Friday. Meanwhile, several states in Midwest and West are reporting record-high hospitalizations ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/03/coronavirus-hospitalizations-grow-in-the-midwest-amid-climbing-cases.html)).

I believe they will either partner-up or (more likely, imo, get bought out). I am going to explain my reasoning why, either way, I think this has the most upside in the market right now (I own lots of shares and options, trying to time the explosion)\n\nThey developed a catheter-lock solution (solution that helps reduce infections) called DefenCath (formerly called Neutrolin). This is a huge issue in the world and hundreds of thousands of people die from this annually - in fact, more people have died from catheter-related infections in 2020 than from COVID.\n\n4 weeks into their 10 week Phase 3 trial, it was halted due to efficacy. Meaning, the board saw all the needed and the results were so convincing, there was no need to continue the trial. The stock went from $.34 to $.80 the next day. The P Value is 0.0006 from the trial - over 1000 times better than the P Value necessary to equate this to a \"successful\" trial. AKA - they knocked it out the park.\n\nAbout 18 months ago, the company conducted a reverse-split (5-1) to get the price over $5 and entice institutions and hedge funds to buy in much heavier. Most funds don't touch stocks unless they are over $5.\n\nRight now, it is trading at $5.66, which is $1.15 pre-split. The Market Cap is only $177 million. The market for Hemodialysis catheter locks is over $1 billion. For Oncology and other indications, it brings it to over $5 billion. Many believe the FDA will approve this for all indications, which will be a HUGE deal. I think this company will be bought out by big pharma\n\nSome facts and reasons why I think this is so bullish and also gets bought out or enters a substantial partnership:\n\n* P Value of 0.0006 is so amazing, I cannot overstate how important this data point is to the company and, more importantly, the FDA\n* The company received Priority Review from the FDA and Fast Track status - which puts them basically ahead of the line for the FDA to review\n* The NDA was accepted by the FDA at the end of August\n* The PDUFA Date (date the FDA will decide approval by) is February 28th\n* The product is currently approved and on sale in Europe, but they use an entirely different process for catheter lock solutions and this just does not fit into their model, so it does not sell well there at all - completely different story in the US and I can go into detail on what the differences are and why it is a non-factor here\n* The Board of Directors is filled with people over the age of 70 and they keep buying\n* Their new CFO has zero CFO experience, but experience in banking in Mergers and Acquisitions\n* New member just joined the board, Paulo Castro, and the PR said \"We are excited about his experience as CEO of Amylin Pharmaceuticals\" - he helped get Amylin bought out for $7 billion. He was the president of 2 other big pharma companies, each worth over $300 billion. He did not join the company for peanuts.\n* Cormedix said they plan to hire a team of 50 sales people to being selling the product - no job listings anywhere and no where to apply - I work in staffing and there is no way they are planning to do this and have it ready by February\n* Upon approval, they have 10.5 years of EXCLUSIVITY - meaning, only they can sell the product. Very attractive to Pfizer, who has the edge on the catheter-lock $5 billion annual market at the moment  \n\n   * **I believe this is a huge reason this will be bought out - 10.5 year exclusivity clock starts the DAY DefenCath is approved. Cormedix can't waste time building a sales team - a company like Pfizer or J&amp;J will want to buy this ASAP so they receive the entire 10.5 year time-frame to dominate the market**\n* JMP set a price target of $22 today (9/29/20200\n* Truist Bank set a price target of $20 last week\n* The CEO, Khoso Baluch, states on every earnings call that they will \"maximize shareholder value\" and are always looking to \"enter strategic partnerships\" - they have indicated they will absolutely be looking for partners to help market Oncology and other indications of the product's market\n* **This is VERY important - they received the right to go after LPAD - which allowed them to end their trial and not conduct another Phase 3 Trial.

I believe they will either partner-up or (more likely, imo, get bought out). I am going to explain my reasoning why, either way, I think this has the most upside in the market right now (I own lots of shares and options, trying to time the explosion)\n\nThey developed a catheter-lock solution (solution that helps reduce infections) called DefenCath (formerly called Neutrolin). This is a huge issue in the world and hundreds of thousands of people die from this annually - in fact, more people have died from catheter-related infections in 2020 than from COVID.\n\n4 weeks into their 10 week Phase 3 trial, it was halted due to efficacy. Meaning, the board saw all the needed and the results were so convincing, there was no need to continue the trial. The stock went from $.34 to $.80 the next day. The P Value is 0.0006 from the trial - over 1000 times better than the P Value necessary to equate this to a \"successful\" trial. AKA - they knocked it out the park.\n\nAbout 18 months ago, the company conducted a reverse-split (5-1) to get the price over $5 and entice institutions and hedge funds to buy in much heavier. Most funds don't touch stocks unless they are over $5.\n\nRight now, it is trading at $5.66, which is $1.15 pre-split. The Market Cap is only $177 million. The market for Hemodialysis catheter locks is over $1 billion. For Oncology and other indications, it brings it to over $5 billion. Many believe the FDA will approve this for all indications, which will be a HUGE deal. I think this company will be bought out by big pharma\n\nSome facts and reasons why I think this is so bullish and also gets bought out or enters a substantial partnership:\n\n* P Value of 0.0006 is so amazing, I cannot overstate how important this data point is to the company and, more importantly, the FDA\n* The company received Priority Review from the FDA and Fast Track status - which puts them basically ahead of the line for the FDA to review\n* The NDA was accepted by the FDA at the end of August\n* The PDUFA Date (date the FDA will decide approval by) is February 28th\n* The product is currently approved and on sale in Europe, but they use an entirely different process for catheter lock solutions and this just does not fit into their model, so it does not sell well there at all - completely different story in the US and I can go into detail on what the differences are and why it is a non-factor here\n* The Board of Directors is filled with people over the age of 70 and they keep buying\n* Their new CFO has zero CFO experience, but experience in banking in Mergers and Acquisitions\n* New member just joined the board, Paulo Castro, and the PR said \"We are excited about his experience as CEO of Amylin Pharmaceuticals\" - he helped get Amylin bought out for $7 billion. He was the president of 2 other big pharma companies, each worth over $300 billion. He did not join the company for peanuts.\n* Cormedix said they plan to hire a team of 50 sales people to being selling the product - no job listings anywhere and no where to apply - I work in staffing and there is no way they are planning to do this and have it ready by February\n* Upon approval, they have 10.5 years of EXCLUSIVITY - meaning, only they can sell the product. Very attractive to Pfizer, who has the edge on the catheter-lock $5 billion annual market at the moment  \n\n   * **I believe this is a huge reason this will be bought out - 10.5 year exclusivity clock starts the DAY DefenCath is approved. Cormedix can't waste time building a sales team - a company like Pfizer or J&amp;J will want to buy this ASAP so they receive the entire 10.5 year time-frame to dominate the market**\n* JMP set a price target of $22 today (9/29/20200\n* Truist Bank set a price target of $20 last week\n* The CEO, Khoso Baluch, states on every earnings call that they will \"maximize shareholder value\" and are always looking to \"enter strategic partnerships\" - they have indicated they will absolutely be looking for partners to help market Oncology and other indications of the product's market\n* **This is VERY important - they received the right to go after LPAD - which allowed them to end their trial and not conduct another Phase 3 Trial. This is a very new process the FDA has rolled out to help drugs and products that have life-saving capabilities to receive approval through a much more streamlined and faster process. It cuts red tape.** It is not as good as regular approval, because the company will need to have certain info on the labels - think about cigarette packaging with warnings on it etc. It will allow them to sell the drug but not to the extent full approval would most likely allow. **What is important here is this allows Cormedix to receive approval through either the regular means OR through LPAD - basically gives them another shot at approval if the committee is nervous about approving a product that had less trials than a typical product would.

Please DM or comment with questions.\n\n**Intro**\n\n$BWMX is a Mexican provider of home goods. It utilizes a direct-to-consumer model to sell its products (read: MLM). While Reddit may be against MLMs, they often have success as business models. One famous example that Ackman could tell you about is Herbalife. I\u2019d encourage everyone reading this to continue reading, and not stop here on principle.\n\nI am long $BWMX for three reasons. First, it is fundamentally undervalued, given its current financial performance. A normalization of P/E to a more appropriate multiple should yield an upside of at least 50%, with 100% being a reasonable longer term target (I will expand on this later). Second, $BWMX enjoys two Covid-19 related headwinds, which have been creating a flywheel. Evidence of continued flywheel momentum is mounting every day. Finally, there are a large number of incentives for management to behave appropriately, and help $BWMX capitalize on the potential from these prior two factors. I will discuss each of these reasons in turn, from last to first.\n\n**Management**\n\nThe company is largely family operated, with Andre Campos serving as CEO, and brother Luis Campos serving as chairman of the board. There is significant insider ownership, aligning the interests of the Campos brothers with shareholders. Institutions own only 1% of the float, which is only 2 million shares (this is an oversimplification which I address later, but understand that this is a low-float company by any measure). In effect, the company is run by an owner-operator. The management team has extensive experience as they\u2019ve been growing $BWMX or similar companies for years. All of this is important, given the fact that overseas companies are often written off due to their opacity; this is not a shell company or one without direction. Here are brief write ups of key executives:\n\n* **Andres Campos \u2013 CEO &amp; Board Member**: CEO (2018-2020); Commercial Director of Betterware (2014-2018); Strategy and New Businesses Director of Betterware (2012-2014)\n* **Luis Campos - Chairman**: Prior to Betterware, Luis Campos served as: Chairman of Tupperware Americas (1994-1999); Chairman of Sara Lee \u2013 House of Fuller Mexico (1991-1993); Chairman of Hasbro Mexico (1984-1990)\n* **Jose del Monte \u2013 CFO**: Regional Director of Banco Regional de Monterrey (2007-2019); Founding Partner of  Geltung Asesores (2001-2007); Corporate Banking Regional Director of Banca Serf\u00edn (1996-2001)\n* **Martin Werner \u2013 CEO &amp; Chairman of DD3 Acquisition Corp / Board Member**: Co-founder of DD3 Capital Partners. Partner at Goldman Sachs (2006-2016); Co-Head of Investment Banking for LatAm; Managing Director at Goldman Sachs (2000-2006)\n\nNote that Martin Werner oversaw the reverse merger transaction which saw $BWMX listed on the NASDAQ.\n\n**Flywheel**\n\nManagement has recently been extremely successful at creating a flywheel effect during Covid-19. First, demand for homegoods and cleaning supplies (which are $BWMX\u2019s primary offerrings) has dramatically risen. This can be seen in Google Trends data for \"cleaning products\" or \u201c[home goods](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=home%20goods).\"\n\nFurther evincing this demand spike are the dramatically increasing viewership numbers on Betterware\u2019s Youtube videos. For those who don\u2019t know, the company releases monthly \u201cCatalogos\u201d, detailing new additions to the product offering. Consider the consistent increase in viewership for these successive releases:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/TMFBlpJ](https://imgur.com/a/TMFBlpJ)\n\nCatalogo 8 will soon be far and away the most viewed release, considering it was released just one week ago. Management has commented on this demand spike, saying:\n\n\u201cAnd I think that this situation of COVID-19 came to accelerate our process to convince people about the importance of cleaning and organization at home. Then we believe that this is something that will remain. People now are more conscious about cleaning and organization, and we are the right providers for that.\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s hard to know whether this will be a permanent lifestyle shift, but as part of my research I\u2019ve spoken to several Mexican friends who have mentioned that Betterware is increasingly popular and an increasing household name.\n\nPart of that is also due to the other half of the flywheel: the increasing number of Betterware representatives who are selling the company\u2019s products as a means to diversify their income stream / earn after having been laid off. To again quote from the earnings call:\n\n\u201cAnd obviously, during the pandemic and during the COVID-19, our growth came mainly from growth in associates and distributors. So these are people that have joined our business, that have joined our model and we expect to remain being part of the model and continue growing from there.\u201d\n\nEssentially, we have an MLM model where the product is actually in high demand, and there is a corresponding rise in sellers as people diversify income streams due to the pandemic. However, the pandemic has only accelerated this effect, which was already occurring. This is crucial, because it means that we are not simply seeing demand be pulled forward; see below.\n\n**Financials**\n\nThe company\u2019s financials speak for themselves and demonstrate that we are seeing acceleration augmenting already strong performance (note that I\u2019ve put the financials below in millions of USD). I\u2019d encourage everyone to play around with the numbers themselves and do their own forecasting. I\u2019ve been highly conservative here, and have simply forecasted revenue, etc. based on down-ward rounded straight line average performance (so this is not even accounting for Covid-19 tailwinds):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||2017|2018|2019|2020E|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|$73.7|$117.90|$163.10|$227.50|\n|Gross Profit|45.3|69.1|95.40|133.07|\n|EBITDA|18.1|29.4|44.30|61.79|\n|Net Income|10.6|15.2|25.00|34.87|\n|EPS|.32|.50|.83|1.33|\n\nAs you can see, the company is trading at 2.8x sales or 14x EPS with these conservative estimates. But adjusting more reasonably for Covid-19, it\u2019s more like 2.5x sales or 12x P/E. Those are numbers you might expect to pay for a solid company in an industry like Insurance or Auto Parts\u2014not a rapidly growing company in an emerging market. Making the mispricing of $BWMX even more apparent is the fact comparable MLM companies universally *have declining YoY EBITDA*. Many of them enjoy comparable or higher multiples, and yet they are money losers, while $BWMX is printing FCF:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/h3SdWci](https://imgur.com/a/h3SdWci)\n\nThe most comparable company is Natura and Co.\u2014they\u2019re growing revenue at a comparable rate\u2014but they trade at a ridiculous P/E of 183.4. Essentially, BWMX is an industry leader, is a beneficiary of Covid-19, and yet is being treated like mature industrial stock. This is not to mention other initiatives, such as the company\u2019s increased focus on digital marketing and its successful trial expansion into Guatemala (Google the earning\u2019s call to learn more).\n\n**Discovery**\n\nThere are several reasons why $BWMX has not yet been efficiently priced. The most obvious is the low float. After all, it\u2019s scarcely worth it for an institution to begin a position at this point, because there are so few shares available. However, with an increasing number of warrants expanding the share count there will be ample room for the fairer pricing that comes with institutional attention (Note: the warrants, $BWXMF, are also severely mispriced). With full warrant conversion, we could see an additional 4.5 million shares and institutional entry. I talk more about the pros and cons of this in the \u201cRisks\u201d section.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, there is *no* sell-side coverage for the stock. As we\u2019ve seen time and time again, sell-side coverage is responsible for massive price movements and price discovery. For instance, NIO recently jumped 5% on a bullish report from DB.\n\nFinally, the company hasn\u2019t been around for very long. It was created through a reverse merger with a S.P.-A.-C. (formatting to avoid Auto-mod), which means that most people simply haven\u2019t heard of it. If you check the Stocktwits message board (I know, I know, Stocktwits\u2026) you\u2019ll see that it has under 200 followers, which I\u2019m using as a rough proxy for market following.\n\nI believe that the company will not go undiscovered for long for three reasons. First, the market, while not perfectly efficient by any means, is not *this* inefficient. I\u2019m seeing increasing chatter on social media about this ticker, which is actually meaningful in terms of discovery, since many institutional bigwigs are on Fintwit. Secondly, earnings are right around the corner (in early November), and it becomes increasingly difficult to ignore a company putting up the financials of $BWMX if they do so for several consecutive quarters.\n\nFinally, the company itself is aware of the fact that it\u2019s undervalued, and has committed to better IR. Per the last earnings call:\n\n\u201cI mean, as you said before, we just listed on March 16 (sic) \\[13\\], a few months ago. We are strengthening our strategy in order to have more activity in this regard in the future. In fact, beginning in September, you will see more and more activity from our side because we really want (inaudible) \\[our investors\\] to know us very well, to understand what our business model represents and to be confident about our consistency in terms of growth and profitability.\u201d\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe main risks for the company are geo-political and legal. First, given the nature of MLMs, such companies are often subjected to unfavorable changes in the law. I don\u2019t know enough about Mexican MLM law to comment further, but my expectation is that\u2014because it\u2019s Mexico\u2014regulations are relatively lax. Still, this is an undeniable risk.\n\nThe geo-political risk is obvious. Given that this is a foreign company listed on the NASDAQ, it\u2019s entirely possible that they\u2019ll face the ire of Trump. And further, USD/Peso currency fluctuations will have a noticeable impact on financial results. As a $BWMX investor, you\u2019ll want a strong peso.\n\nAnother thing worth discussing is the possibility of dilution. There exist warrants trading under $BWXMF which have a dividend-protected strike price of $11.50 (so, effectively, $10 with the current dividend). When and if these are tendered, they will increase the float by \\~4.5 million shares. This could be good for institutional involvement, but it obviously will not be good from a pure supply / demand perspective. In fact, I\u2019m confident that the recent dip is at least somewhat attributable to people cashing in some of their warrants. However, I think that conversion will occur slowly, because the potential of the company is so obvious. I could also see an activist investor buying up warrants and challenging any tender offer that occurs. If a tender offer *does* occur, you should see 30% upside or more on the warrants immediately (which is actually a risk, because I think that\u2019s still undervaluing them).\n\nOf course, all of the regular risks\u2014such as a new market entrant or a failure to monetize their distribution network\u2014apply. But the above two risks are the ones which I believe could serve to significantly limit upside.\n\nYet, given the ridiculous valuations in U.S. equities, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t say that the risk / reward here seems favorable.\n\n**Summary**\n\nOver time, $BWMX will be more fairly priced, assuming that it continues to perform. It\u2019s hard to assign a price target, but if it maintained the pace of its revenue growth, this would be at least a bagger in a year or two. The upside will be realized through continued financial performance accelerated by the Covid-19 flywheel, and catalyzed by discovery and improved IR communication. The risks are mainly legal and geo-poltical in nature. I\u2019d encourage everyone to strongly consider $BWMX, and I am long.\n\n*Disclaimer: I have a large position in $BWMX.

Please DM or comment with questions.\n\n**Intro**\n\n$BWMX is a Mexican provider of home goods. It utilizes a direct-to-consumer model to sell its products (read: MLM). While Reddit may be against MLMs, they often have success as business models. One famous example that Ackman could tell you about is Herbalife. I\u2019d encourage everyone reading this to continue reading, and not stop here on principle.\n\nI am long $BWMX for three reasons. First, it is fundamentally undervalued, given its current financial performance. A normalization of P/E to a more appropriate multiple should yield an upside of at least 50%, with 100% being a reasonable longer term target (I will expand on this later). Second, $BWMX enjoys two Covid-19 related headwinds, which have been creating a flywheel. Evidence of continued flywheel momentum is mounting every day. Finally, there are a large number of incentives for management to behave appropriately, and help $BWMX capitalize on the potential from these prior two factors. I will discuss each of these reasons in turn, from last to first.\n\n**Management**\n\nThe company is largely family operated, with Andre Campos serving as CEO, and brother Luis Campos serving as chairman of the board. There is significant insider ownership, aligning the interests of the Campos brothers with shareholders. Institutions own only 1% of the float, which is only 2 million shares (this is an oversimplification which I address later, but understand that this is a low-float company by any measure). In effect, the company is run by an owner-operator. The management team has extensive experience as they\u2019ve been growing $BWMX or similar companies for years. All of this is important, given the fact that overseas companies are often written off due to their opacity; this is not a shell company or one without direction. Here are brief write ups of key executives:\n\n* **Andres Campos \u2013 CEO &amp; Board Member**: CEO (2018-2020); Commercial Director of Betterware (2014-2018); Strategy and New Businesses Director of Betterware (2012-2014)\n* **Luis Campos - Chairman**: Prior to Betterware, Luis Campos served as: Chairman of Tupperware Americas (1994-1999); Chairman of Sara Lee \u2013 House of Fuller Mexico (1991-1993); Chairman of Hasbro Mexico (1984-1990)\n* **Jose del Monte \u2013 CFO**: Regional Director of Banco Regional de Monterrey (2007-2019); Founding Partner of  Geltung Asesores (2001-2007); Corporate Banking Regional Director of Banca Serf\u00edn (1996-2001)\n* **Martin Werner \u2013 CEO &amp; Chairman of DD3 Acquisition Corp / Board Member**: Co-founder of DD3 Capital Partners. Partner at Goldman Sachs (2006-2016); Co-Head of Investment Banking for LatAm; Managing Director at Goldman Sachs (2000-2006)\n\nNote that Martin Werner oversaw the reverse merger transaction which saw $BWMX listed on the NASDAQ.\n\n**Flywheel**\n\nManagement has recently been extremely successful at creating a flywheel effect during Covid-19. First, demand for homegoods and cleaning supplies (which are $BWMX\u2019s primary offerrings) has dramatically risen. This can be seen in Google Trends data for \"cleaning products\" or \u201c[home goods](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=home%20goods).\"\n\nFurther evincing this demand spike are the dramatically increasing viewership numbers on Betterware\u2019s Youtube videos. For those who don\u2019t know, the company releases monthly \u201cCatalogos\u201d, detailing new additions to the product offering. Consider the consistent increase in viewership for these successive releases:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/TMFBlpJ](https://imgur.com/a/TMFBlpJ)\n\nCatalogo 8 will soon be far and away the most viewed release, considering it was released just one week ago. Management has commented on this demand spike, saying:\n\n\u201cAnd I think that this situation of COVID-19 came to accelerate our process to convince people about the importance of cleaning and organization at home. Then we believe that this is something that will remain. People now are more conscious about cleaning and organization, and we are the right providers for that.\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s hard to know whether this will be a permanent lifestyle shift, but as part of my research I\u2019ve spoken to several Mexican friends who have mentioned that Betterware is increasingly popular and an increasing household name.\n\nPart of that is also due to the other half of the flywheel: the increasing number of Betterware representatives who are selling the company\u2019s products as a means to diversify their income stream / earn after having been laid off. To again quote from the earnings call:\n\n\u201cAnd obviously, during the pandemic and during the COVID-19, our growth came mainly from growth in associates and distributors. So these are people that have joined our business, that have joined our model and we expect to remain being part of the model and continue growing from there.\u201d\n\nEssentially, we have an MLM model where the product is actually in high demand, and there is a corresponding rise in sellers as people diversify income streams due to the pandemic. However, the pandemic has only accelerated this effect, which was already occurring. This is crucial, because it means that we are not simply seeing demand be pulled forward; see below.\n\n**Financials**\n\nThe company\u2019s financials speak for themselves and demonstrate that we are seeing acceleration augmenting already strong performance (note that I\u2019ve put the financials below in millions of USD). I\u2019d encourage everyone to play around with the numbers themselves and do their own forecasting. I\u2019ve been highly conservative here, and have simply forecasted revenue, etc. based on down-ward rounded straight line average performance (so this is not even accounting for Covid-19 tailwinds):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||2017|2018|2019|2020E|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|$73.7|$117.90|$163.10|$227.50|\n|Gross Profit|45.3|69.1|95.40|133.07|\n|EBITDA|18.1|29.4|44.30|61.79|\n|Net Income|10.6|15.2|25.00|34.87|\n|EPS|.32|.50|.83|1.33|\n\nAs you can see, the company is trading at 2.8x sales or 14x EPS with these conservative estimates. But adjusting more reasonably for Covid-19, it\u2019s more like 2.5x sales or 12x P/E. Those are numbers you might expect to pay for a solid company in an industry like Insurance or Auto Parts\u2014not a rapidly growing company in an emerging market. Making the mispricing of $BWMX even more apparent is the fact comparable MLM companies universally *have declining YoY EBITDA*. Many of them enjoy comparable or higher multiples, and yet they are money losers, while $BWMX is printing FCF:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/h3SdWci](https://imgur.com/a/h3SdWci)\n\nThe most comparable company is Natura and Co.\u2014they\u2019re growing revenue at a comparable rate\u2014but they trade at a ridiculous P/E of 183.4. Essentially, BWMX is an industry leader, is a beneficiary of Covid-19, and yet is being treated like mature industrial stock. This is not to mention other initiatives, such as the company\u2019s increased focus on digital marketing and its successful trial expansion into Guatemala (Google the earning\u2019s call to learn more).\n\n**Discovery**\n\nThere are several reasons why $BWMX has not yet been efficiently priced. The most obvious is the low float. After all, it\u2019s scarcely worth it for an institution to begin a position at this point, because there are so few shares available. However, with an increasing number of warrants expanding the share count there will be ample room for the fairer pricing that comes with institutional attention (Note: the warrants, $BWXMF, are also severely mispriced). With full warrant conversion, we could see an additional 4.5 million shares and institutional entry. I talk more about the pros and cons of this in the \u201cRisks\u201d section.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, there is *no* sell-side coverage for the stock. As we\u2019ve seen time and time again, sell-side coverage is responsible for massive price movements and price discovery. For instance, NIO recently jumped 5% on a bullish report from DB.\n\nFinally, the company hasn\u2019t been around for very long. It was created through a reverse merger with a S.P.-A.-C. (formatting to avoid Auto-mod), which means that most people simply haven\u2019t heard of it. If you check the Stocktwits message board (I know, I know, Stocktwits\u2026) you\u2019ll see that it has under 200 followers, which I\u2019m using as a rough proxy for market following.\n\nI believe that the company will not go undiscovered for long for three reasons. First, the market, while not perfectly efficient by any means, is not *this* inefficient. I\u2019m seeing increasing chatter on social media about this ticker, which is actually meaningful in terms of discovery, since many institutional bigwigs are on Fintwit. Secondly, earnings are right around the corner (in early November), and it becomes increasingly difficult to ignore a company putting up the financials of $BWMX if they do so for several consecutive quarters.\n\nFinally, the company itself is aware of the fact that it\u2019s undervalued, and has committed to better IR. Per the last earnings call:\n\n\u201cI mean, as you said before, we just listed on March 16 (sic) \\[13\\], a few months ago. We are strengthening our strategy in order to have more activity in this regard in the future. In fact, beginning in September, you will see more and more activity from our side because we really want (inaudible) \\[our investors\\] to know us very well, to understand what our business model represents and to be confident about our consistency in terms of growth and profitability.\u201d\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe main risks for the company are geo-political and legal. First, given the nature of MLMs, such companies are often subjected to unfavorable changes in the law. I don\u2019t know enough about Mexican MLM law to comment further, but my expectation is that\u2014because it\u2019s Mexico\u2014regulations are relatively lax. Still, this is an undeniable risk.\n\nThe geo-political risk is obvious. Given that this is a foreign company listed on the NASDAQ, it\u2019s entirely possible that they\u2019ll face the ire of Trump. And further, USD/Peso currency fluctuations will have a noticeable impact on financial results. As a $BWMX investor, you\u2019ll want a strong peso.\n\nAnother thing worth discussing is the possibility of dilution. There exist warrants trading under $BWXMF which have a dividend-protected strike price of $11.50 (so, effectively, $10 with the current dividend). When and if these are tendered, they will increase the float by \\~4.5 million shares. This could be good for institutional involvement, but it obviously will not be good from a pure supply / demand perspective. In fact, I\u2019m confident that the recent dip is at least somewhat attributable to people cashing in some of their warrants. However, I think that conversion will occur slowly, because the potential of the company is so obvious. I could also see an activist investor buying up warrants and challenging any tender offer that occurs. If a tender offer *does* occur, you should see 30% upside or more on the warrants immediately (which is actually a risk, because I think that\u2019s still undervaluing them).\n\nOf course, all of the regular risks\u2014such as a new market entrant or a failure to monetize their distribution network\u2014apply. But the above two risks are the ones which I believe could serve to significantly limit upside.\n\nYet, given the ridiculous valuations in U.S. equities, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t say that the risk / reward here seems favorable.\n\n**Summary**\n\nOver time, $BWMX will be more fairly priced, assuming that it continues to perform. It\u2019s hard to assign a price target, but if it maintained the pace of its revenue growth, this would be at least a bagger in a year or two. The upside will be realized through continued financial performance accelerated by the Covid-19 flywheel, and catalyzed by discovery and improved IR communication. The risks are mainly legal and geo-poltical in nature. I\u2019d encourage everyone to strongly consider $BWMX, and I am long.\n\n*Disclaimer: I have a large position in $BWMX.

If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that\u2019s not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it\u2019s incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging \u2013 essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world \u2013 as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \\[1\\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs \u2013 a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \\[2\\], while the R&amp;D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \\[3\\].\n\nWhat is packaging?\n\nThe  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the \u2018workers\u2019 more productive in smaller spaces \u2013 first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we\u2019re now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it\u2019s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\\[4\\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they\u2019re specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that\u2019s not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  \u2018monolithic\u2019 , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.\n\n3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.\n\nChiplets\n\nChiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they\u2019re  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that\u2019s widely used right now (notably in  AMD\u2019s Zen 2 architecture), has an \u2018interposer\u2019 sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\\[5\\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we\u2019ll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it\u2019s likely that they\u2019re using TSMC\u2019s  CoWoS \u2013 Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \\[6\\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \\[7\\]While this approach is faster \u2013 each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won\u2019t have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting \u2018stuck\u2019, as you  would with AMD\u2019s approach, it\u2019s harder to design products for \u2013 you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies\u2019 philosophies. AMD\u2019s  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made  it\u2019s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an  attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences  inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it\u2019s  evident that each company has chosen the approach that\u2019s best for it \u2013  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD\u2019s smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD\u2019s  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the \u2018concrete  foundation\u2019 is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \\[8\\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. \u2013 just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.\n\nChiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they\u2019re sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two \u2018teams\u2019 have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it\u2019ll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.\n\n3D stacking\n\nIn  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it\u2019s easier to discuss them separately.\n\n3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its\u2019 \u2018Foveros\u2019 stacking tech in 2019 \\[9\\],  Samsung announced their \u2018X-cube\u2019 packaging a few weeks ago \\[10\\], and  TSMC announcing their \u20183DFabric\u2019 family just a few days ago \\[11\\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained  earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the  heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made  by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large  amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D  stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like  mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking  forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book,  to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical  footprint.\\[12\\] Even \u2018true\u2019 3D stacking \u2013 where you build layers one on  top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have  been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn\u2019t far  behind.\\[13\\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the  high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved  the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling  issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred  through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \\[14\\] These  are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data.  Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the  connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can  technically stack any chips we want together right now \u2013 TSMC\u2019s SoIC is  slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \\[11\\] the  issue is that cutting edge chips \u2013 especially x86 chips used in  datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat.  AMD Epyc\u2019s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power \u2013 an approximation of  how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \\[15\\]while Intel\u2019s  Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \\[16\\] When you consider the fact that all  this heat is coming off a piece of silicon &lt;500mm2, it\u2019s apparent  that it\u2019s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies \u2013 either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \\[17\\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips \u2013 for instance  Samsung\u2019s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \\[10\\] We\u2019re likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 of high-power logic on logic \u2013  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it\u2019s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive \u2013 even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.\n\nAfter  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn\u2019t I going to tell you  why Intel\u2019s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn\u2019t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel\u2019s future  is promising is threefold.\n\n1. Packaging  is in its\u2019 infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we\u2019re at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it\u2019s easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has \u2018won\u2019 the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.\n2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \\[18\\]\\[19\\] Although Intel\u2019s operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it\u2019s likely  that Intel\u2019s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel\u2019s engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It\u2019s current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.\n3. Intel\u2019s  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback \u2013 a terrifying thought for any competitors.\n\nIf these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.\n\nSemiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I\u2019m investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.\n\nFeel free to contact me if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like me to look

If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that\u2019s not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it\u2019s incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging \u2013 essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world \u2013 as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \\[1\\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs \u2013 a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \\[2\\], while the R&amp;D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \\[3\\].\n\nWhat is packaging?\n\nThe  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the \u2018workers\u2019 more productive in smaller spaces \u2013 first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we\u2019re now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it\u2019s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\\[4\\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they\u2019re specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that\u2019s not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  \u2018monolithic\u2019 , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.\n\n3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.\n\nChiplets\n\nChiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they\u2019re  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that\u2019s widely used right now (notably in  AMD\u2019s Zen 2 architecture), has an \u2018interposer\u2019 sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\\[5\\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we\u2019ll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it\u2019s likely that they\u2019re using TSMC\u2019s  CoWoS \u2013 Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \\[6\\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \\[7\\]While this approach is faster \u2013 each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won\u2019t have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting \u2018stuck\u2019, as you  would with AMD\u2019s approach, it\u2019s harder to design products for \u2013 you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies\u2019 philosophies. AMD\u2019s  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design.

Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it\u2019s  evident that each company has chosen the approach that\u2019s best for it \u2013  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD\u2019s smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD\u2019s  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the \u2018concrete  foundation\u2019 is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \\[8\\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. \u2013 just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.\n\nChiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they\u2019re sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two \u2018teams\u2019 have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it\u2019ll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.\n\n3D stacking\n\nIn  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it\u2019s easier to discuss them separately.\n\n3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its\u2019 \u2018Foveros\u2019 stacking tech in 2019 \\[9\\],  Samsung announced their \u2018X-cube\u2019 packaging a few weeks ago \\[10\\], and  TSMC announcing their \u20183DFabric\u2019 family just a few days ago \\[11\\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years.

Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies \u2013 either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \\[17\\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips \u2013 for instance  Samsung\u2019s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \\[10\\] We\u2019re likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 of high-power logic on logic \u2013  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it\u2019s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive \u2013 even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.\n\nAfter  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn\u2019t I going to tell you  why Intel\u2019s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn\u2019t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel\u2019s future  is promising is threefold.\n\n1. Packaging  is in its\u2019 infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we\u2019re at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it\u2019s easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has \u2018won\u2019 the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.\n2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \\[18\\]\\[19\\] Although Intel\u2019s operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it\u2019s likely  that Intel\u2019s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel\u2019s engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It\u2019s current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.\n3. Intel\u2019s  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback \u2013 a terrifying thought for any competitors.\n\nIf these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.\n\nSemiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I\u2019m investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.\n\nFeel free to contact me if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!\n\n\\[1\\]

If Tesla\u2019s million-kilometer battery is really realized, electric vehicles will achieve a qualitative leap in mileage and battery life, and battery recycling will also become a thing of the past.\n\nSingle crystal cathode battery\n\nTesla single crystal cathode battery, this battery is also a lithium ion battery. It uses a new generation of single crystal NMC532 cathodes and a new brand-new electrolyte, which can enable electric vehicles to travel continuously for 1.6 million kilometers. The battery technology we are using can only maintain about 1,000 charge and discharge cycles, and this battery allows 90% of the battery's capacity to maintain a normal level after 4,000 charge and discharge cycles. Therefore, the single-cathode battery can still maintain 90% capacity after achieving 1.6 million kilometers of travel. This also means that if the battery is installed in a car, even if the whole car is scrapped, the battery can still be used.\n\nSilicon nanowire\n\nanode battery. The weight of the battery cell of this battery will be reduced by half, and the space occupied will be half of the current lithium ion battery. This means that with the same battery volume and quality, the energy density of the battery pack will be greatly improved. At present, the energy density of Tesla batteries is about 250Wh/kg. If this silicon nanowire anode technology is used, the energy density of Tesla batteries will reach about 400Wh/kg. At the same time, this battery has a high cycle life, and mass-produced cells are not far away.

It uses a new generation of single crystal NMC532 cathodes and a new brand-new electrolyte, which can enable electric vehicles to travel continuously for 1.6 million kilometers. The battery technology we are using can only maintain about 1,000 charge and discharge cycles, and this battery allows 90% of the battery's capacity to maintain a normal level after 4,000 charge and discharge cycles. Therefore, the single-cathode battery can still maintain 90% capacity after achieving 1.6 million kilometers of travel. This also means that if the battery is installed in a car, even if the whole car is scrapped, the battery can still be used.\n\nSilicon nanowire\n\nanode battery.

This means that with the same battery volume and quality, the energy density of the battery pack will be greatly improved. At present, the energy density of Tesla batteries is about 250Wh/kg. If this silicon nanowire anode technology is used, the energy density of Tesla batteries will reach about 400Wh/kg. At the same time, this battery has a high cycle life, and mass-produced cells are not far away.

I've been using Unity myself since 2012 so I've seen it grow quite a bit, as well as how the company itself behaves.\n\n---\n\nThe Good:\n\n* Unity (the engine) steadily improves. Performance is better, the in-engine tools are better, features are better. Strong retention. \n* Massive community. The Unity community is enormous, and passionate. New devs with questions can almost always find the answer on forums, subreddits, or the official discord server. The community is one of the strongest I've seen in tech. **This is very important**; the Unity community, in my experience, is much stronger, passionate, and active, than the general game dev community. \n* Massively used more than competitors in indie spaces. On their website, they boast 1.5 million monthly active users. [This article from 2018](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/unity-ceo-says-half-of-all-games-are-built-on-unity/) has some pretty impressive numbers: 50% of all games, but 60-70% of mobile games specifically. Probably safe to say that these numbers have increased. Also, Epic's fight with Apple COULD potentially give Unity an even larger share. \n* More generalized. Compared to its competitors, Unity has a much wider range of options in terms of what you can make. 3D, 2D, VR, AR, you can pretty much do anything, and do it well (except 2D, sort of). \n* Extremely easy to learn. Unity offers many courses and example projects, both paid and free. It's extremely easy for a beginner to hop in and start learning. Additionally, compared to it's competitors (specifically Unreal), Unity's interface is extremely simple. The engine is also bundled with Visual Studio Community, Microsoft's extremely powerful ide (which has an official Unity extension). I've noticed a trend of smaller engines/frameworks switching their interface to match Unity's, which may reinforce this idea. \n* Asset store. The asset store has gotten significantly better over the last couple years, and is used quite often by developers. Devs buy or sell assets on the store; sellers set their own price, and pretty much anything can go on it. Every sale, Unity gets 30%.\n\n---\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* Currently extremely hard to increase revenue from core users. The current model Unity uses, is that if your game/app/business makes less than 100k a year, or you're a student, you pay them nothing. Literally $0. And personally, I believe that they are struggling to motivate indies to pay or subscribe. Their lowest price tier is $400 a year, which isnt that bad, but barely offers any differences as an individual. At one point they even had dark mode locked behind a paywall, but very recently made it free. The only feature I think is truly worth the money is their Teams, specifically collab, which is basically a real time integrated git. It's $9 a month at the low end, which is fair imo, but not a lot in the grand scheme of things. \n* Half baked ideas. Unity tends to dump a lot of dev time on large scale additions to the engine, or overhauling a feature. Sometimes these go well, most of the time they end up being something pretty obscure that only a handful of people are going to use, but sometimes they end up completely outclassed by an existing asset on the store or forgotten about. Three big examples of this are UNET, the 2D engine (too much to type out, but this was and still is absolute garbo compared to alternatives), and the text system. UNET was intended to be an overhaul of the existing (and very bad) networking solution, but was, in a lot of ways, confusing and also bad. Assets already existed that were far better, such as Photon.\nLuckily, Unity sort of learned their lesson with their 3D text, by adding a popular asset to the engine instead of redoing it themselves, but the initial implementation was very sloppy. In general, they seem to spin their wheels quite often on big changes.\n* Inferior to specialization. Unity is very general. AAA games, where the big money is, cannot generally afford to be general. Unreal beats Unity's ass in 3D games, specifically first person and third person games. Do not get me wrong, Unity has made incredible progress in the 3D rendering department. But as seen in Unreal's latest presentation, their rendering is phenomenal. Imo unless Unreal slips up or Unity makes a breakthrough, Unreal will always be about a year ahead. Additionally, and this is not at the fault of Unity, Unreal started as a FPS engine. So as AAA studios made FPS games, the obvious choice was Unreal. Typically, a large studio has access to the source code, which allows them to hyper specialize the engine to their projects needs, but this leads into a big problem for Unity: when the team needs a new engine, they're going to move to the next iteration, because it's more than likely that their optimizations will be able to carry over, and it would be stupid to start from scratch. It's very common for AAA studios to create all their project in a \"modified\" unreal engine, primarily because it's just what they started with. This sort of makes Unity just an option for completely unrelated new projects, like how Blizzard used Unity for Hearthstone.\n\n---\n\nConclusion: \n\nI think Unity is a strong long term option, but they'll probably come out overvalued due to hype. I plan on picking up a couple shares and see how things trend, but this is definitely not a company with explosive short term growth like you see with cloud computing.

The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. \n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/\n\n**Apple**\n\nBack in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple\u2019s stock shouldn\u2019t obsess with near-term iPhone sales. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,\u201d he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html\n\nLook at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.\n\n\n**Intel**\n\nI'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader\u2019s methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely on solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't. Also, the fact that TSMC will be on 5 nm by the time Intel fixes the 10 nm/7 nm node problems. Those are problems I'm well aware of and they have been beaten to death already. There is nothing I can add to that. I will talk about that later on but in the end as not the focal points. What I'd like to talk about and focus on is the data-centric transformation and its MobilEye division.\n\n\n**Data Centric Transformation**\n\nIntel in 2019 pivoted from being a PC centric business to a data centric business. The TAM of this is 250 billion dollars. Revenue in this business group has grown from 42% of revenue in 2015 to 51% of revenue over the TTM. While many business transitions result in periods of low performance, as firms switch focus from declining to new businesses, Intel has managed to grow its revenue by 12% compounded annually over the past four years as it better positions itself for future growth.\n\nhttps://channelbuzz.ca/2019/04/intel-emphasizes-data-centric-transformation-of-company-at-new-xeon-launch-30025/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\n**Self driving business**\n\nIntel purchased MobilEye in 2015. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel . Mobileye has a plan to dominate self-driving. Self driving taxis and cars are a big growth business. MobilEye is in a great position to capitalize on this business. Mobileye says it shipped 17.4 million systems last year. Today, over 40 million cars have Mobileye technology installed, and our products have been selected for implementation in serial production of 313 car models from our 27 OEM partners by 2017 (compared to 36 car models across seven OEMs in 2010). Some of the partners include Volkswagen, BMW, Nissan, Ford. It also has partnered with NIO, a Chinese EV company which people have dubbed the Chinese Tesla.\n\nThe firm\u2019s acquisition of Mobileye strategically positions it to build out its driverless technology business as well. In just three years, Mobileye has experienced rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $210 million in 2017 to $879 million in 2019. Its share of automobile semiconductor sales increased from just 0.5% to 1.9% over the same time. If Mobileye continues taking market share in this fast-growing segment, Mobileye\u2019s could provide a meaningful contribution to Intel\u2019s operations, as it made up just over 1% of revenue in 2019. ResearchAndMarkets.com expects the autonomous/driverless market to grow 18% compounded annually from 2020 to 2025. Intel is positioned to grow with this new market.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/ford-expands-partnership-with-mobileye-intels-autonomous-driving-business/\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18039216/volkswagen-intel-mobileye-self-driving-ride-hailing-israel-2019\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/mobileye-testing-autonomous-cars-germany-104521486.html\n\n\n**PC Business**\n\nThis is the side of Intel most people immediately associate Intel with. Intel\u2019s PC-centric business is not something to write-off. There is still a piece of the PC-centric market where Intel has an opportunity to grow: graphics processing units (GPU). Allied Market Research, expects the GPU market to grow from $19.8 billion in 2019 to nearly $201 billion in 2027 or by 34% compounded annually. For example, Intel is aggressively entering the discreet GPU business, which is about 80% of the current GPU market. The iGPU processors codenamed Tiger Lake just released September 2nd. Intel poached AMD's GPU guy Raja Koduri and nVidia's Tom Peterson. Intel hired engineers and marketing experts from Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA, the market leader in the space, to assemble a team to develop and rollout the firm\u2019s Intel Xe GPU.\n\nIntel is also releasing entry level processors. The entry-level processors will be targeted at budget-tier laptops and fanless mini desktops when they launch in early 2021. \n\nhttps://www.nextplatform.com/2020/09/02/intel-puts-its-xe-gpu-stakes-in-the-ground/\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-jasper-lake-10nm-tremont-atom-cpus-leak-pentium-celeron-skus-2021/\n\n\n**7 nm/10 nm process**\n\nSince I have your attention until here - I'd like to say one final thing about this debacle. Lot of people assume that Intel's problems with this are due to complacency. Its not. Its due to Intel attempting to achieve and do something others have been unable to do, which is the exact opposite of complacency. Intel tried to use GAAFET for 7 nm when TSMC and Samsung warned Intel not to.  Intel was warned by TSMC and Samsung that the GAA-FET technique is too challenging to implement at this point in time, but Intel\u2019s pride and persistence led it to stubbornly try and tackle the GAA-FET problem, until it finally conceded this July.\n\nI agree Intel fucked up here but the point I'm trying to make is that this was not due to complacency as widely believed. Intel has a lot of management problems, hostile work environment etc but complacency is not one of them.  Intel never got complacent about its objectives, but it may have gotten complacent about its approaches, methods, and processes.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/i8qrx4/intel_exemployee_reveals_insider_details_on/\nhttps://www.dvhardware.net/article73530.html\n\n\n**Tl/DR; Post Summary / Post Script** : \n\nI'm perfecty aware that AMD and nVidia are eating Intel's lunch and have better more powerful CPUs/GPUs.

The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. \n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/\n\n**Apple**\n\nBack in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple\u2019s stock shouldn\u2019t obsess with near-term iPhone sales. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,\u201d he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html\n\nLook at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.\n\n\n**Intel**\n\nI'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader\u2019s methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely on solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't. Also, the fact that TSMC will be on 5 nm by the time Intel fixes the 10 nm/7 nm node problems. Those are problems I'm well aware of and they have been beaten to death already. There is nothing I can add to that. I will talk about that later on but in the end as not the focal points. What I'd like to talk about and focus on is the data-centric transformation and its MobilEye division.\n\n\n**Data Centric Transformation**\n\nIntel in 2019 pivoted from being a PC centric business to a data centric business. The TAM of this is 250 billion dollars. Revenue in this business group has grown from 42% of revenue in 2015 to 51% of revenue over the TTM. While many business transitions result in periods of low performance, as firms switch focus from declining to new businesses, Intel has managed to grow its revenue by 12% compounded annually over the past four years as it better positions itself for future growth.\n\nhttps://channelbuzz.ca/2019/04/intel-emphasizes-data-centric-transformation-of-company-at-new-xeon-launch-30025/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\n**Self driving business**\n\nIntel purchased MobilEye in 2015. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel . Mobileye has a plan to dominate self-driving. Self driving taxis and cars are a big growth business. MobilEye is in a great position to capitalize on this business. Mobileye says it shipped 17.4 million systems last year. Today, over 40 million cars have Mobileye technology installed, and our products have been selected for implementation in serial production of 313 car models from our 27 OEM partners by 2017 (compared to 36 car models across seven OEMs in 2010).

Consumer behavior is changing along with worries of beef consumption due to climate change. \n\n2. Increasing awareness of health benefits provided by plant based meat. \n\n3. Potential for lower prices due to economies of scale as plant-based meat industry grows\n\n4. Logical economic efficiency in plant-based meat production versus animal based meat. \n\nPlant based: Agriculture \u2192 meat\n\nAnimal based: Agriculture \u2192 animal \u2192 meat\n\n----------------------\n\n**Reasons** **why** **Beyond** **Meat** **will** **lead** **the** **plant** **based** **meat** **industry**\n\n--------------------\n\n1. Current market leader, incredible growth numbers and market share gains over time, despite traditional meat companies starting plant programs. \n\n2. Strategic partnerships with businesses such as Del Taco, Dunkin, Carl's Jr, Subway, Denny\u2019s, Hardees, TGI Fridays, KFC, Kroger, WholeFoods, Starbucks, Sam\u2019s Club, Costco, Target, Publix, Walmart &amp; many more\n\n3.Strong management team. Ethan Brown is a charismatic, visionary CEO. \n\n4. Beyond is the most recognized plant-based meat brand in the U.S. According to the most recent conference call, 5% of U.S. households purchased Beyond Meat products (Up 33% from January) and the repeat purchase rate rose to 50%, from 45% from January. \n\n5. Beyond has seen significant growth in China, with their launch into Starbucks, Yum Brands China, and grocery locations such as Freshippo (operated by Alibaba)\n\n6. 7% of revenue currently goes towards R&amp;D in order to ride the lowering cost curve towards lower prices than animal based meat.\n\n7. Management aims for the start of 2024 to have lower price than animal based meat in one of beef, pork or poultry. \n\n--------------------\n\n**Risks** **and** **potential** **downfalls**\n\n-----------------------\n\n1. Beyond\u2019s brand name could be tarnished and cause them to lose market share.\n\n2. Legacy meat companies can outspend Beyond and take market share of plant based meat future\n\n3. Consumers could be less receptive to plant based meat and climate change/health benefits could be seen as overblown.\n\n4. Beyond isn\u2019t able to innovate enough to lower costs &amp; prices in line with animal based meat\n\n5. Studies come out showing Beyond\u2019s products have adverse health effects. (Despite the recent University of Michigan study showing the health benefits of Beyond)\n\n6. Plant based market never overtakes animal based market (3 &amp; 4)\n\n7. Plant based meat becomes comoticized and Beyond is unable to become consistently profitable.\n\n----------------\n\n**Price** **Targets** (**5** **year** **timeline**)\n\n------------------\n\n1.

(36X). \n\n4. 2023 sales estimates could easily be much higher than 1.23 billion. Especially if costs &amp; prices keep declining + more strategic partnerships develop. I\u2019m estimating sales closer to $2 billion in my bull case. This would mean a P/S ratio of 4. \n\n5.

Beyond\u2019s 2.5% 2019 global market share in the plant based meat market rises to 5% market share in 2025. \n\n* More big time strategic partnerships with major foodservice companies (possibly McDonalds) \n\n*Brand penetration continues to increase\n\n* Internationally distribution network expands\n\n* Substantial expansion into China and Southeast Asia\n\n*Competitors fail to innovate at the same rate of Beyond and have higher prices than Beyond\n\n3.

However, Barrick Gold has a break even gold price of just $950 per oz meaning that its profit per oz has just doubled from $500 to $1,000.  That should boost profits significantly.

I've noticed a trend of people inquiring about these companies so I hope that this post can provide some information. \n\n---------------------------\n\nI'll provide a brief bullish thesis and some information about my investments in renewables. These are in order of weight in my portfolio. \n\n------------------------------\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nMost of us know what Tesla is about. They are the global leader in electric vehicles and will eventually come out with autonomous driving but I'll focus on their energy business. They sell solar panels with the lowest cost/watt of U.S. manufacturers, but this isn't the exciting part of their energy business. They are a leader in battery storage, which is an integral part of a renewable future. Energy storage systems store energy produced from solar panels and when the sun isn't shining, energy is consumed from the batteries instead. Also their autobidder software, which is out in trial in Massachusetts and Australia I believe, eventually will turn energy into a market place for Tesla customers. Read more about autobidder here: https://www.tesla.com/support/autobidder \n\nMy bull case for Tesla (specifically the energy side of the business) is that they will continue to innovate with their low cost panels, and be a leader in battery storage, plus leverage their autobidder software to bring added value to residential customers.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nVestas Wind Systems (VWDRY) \n\nhttps://www.vestas.com/~/media/vestas/investor/investor%20pdf/financial%20reports/2020/q2/2020%20q2_pres.pdf\n\nVestas is the leading manufacturer and installer of wind turbines. They have a global footprint and are expected to grow in line with the growth of the wind industry as a whole. A major growth engine in their business is going to be their expanding service and maintenance business, which has very high margins. My bull case for Vestas is that they are a unique pure play wind turbine company with years of experience in the growing industry. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR)\n\nFirst Solar is an American based solar module manufacturing and solar project operating company. Most of their business comes from corporate and grid level solar projects. Notably, they have Next Era Energy, Microsoft and Apple as customers. The real bullish case behind First Solar is around their differentiated Cadmium Telluride solar modules. Compared to the standard Crystalline silicon technology, First Solar's modules last longer and produce energy at higher efficiencies in hotter climates. \n\nMy bull case for First Solar is around their differentiated technology, strong balance sheet, and position as an American company, which typically warrants a higher P/E ratio than foreign countries. \n\n----------------------------------\n\nJinko Solar (JKS) \n\nhttps://ir.jinkosolar.com/static-files/5a6d9266-d288-4ece-a0ea-f8e49ff60119\n\nJinko Solar is a leader is a Chinese based solar panel manufacturer. They produce low cost modules and also manage solar projects. Their business model is similar to First Solar's, however they trade at a cheaper valuation, due to being a Chinese company. You can read more about their technology on their investor relations page, but my main bull case for this company is around their position in South East Asia as a leading manufacturer, as this is undoubtably the biggest potential market for solar energy. \n\n--------------------------\n\nCanadian Solar (CSIQ) \n\nhttp://investors.canadiansolar.com/events\n\nCanadian Solar is also a leader in the module manufacturing &amp; project development business. They have a similar business model with Jinko and First Solar. Canadian Solar owns equity stakes in several of their solar projects, which gives them a source of recurring revenue. They also have a large footprint in American grid/commercial systems and are a market leader in North America. \nThey trade at an absurdly low 5 P/E ratio despite significant growth expectations in the coming years. \n\nMy bull case for CSIQ is around their ability to dominate the current market and potential to capitalize off of further market growth and consolidation towards the biggest solar companies. Also their current valuation is very intriguing. \n\n--------------------------\n\nSolarEdge (SEDG) \n\nhttps://investors.solaredge.com/\n\nSolarEdge is the global leader in the Inverter space, with a 60% U.S. market share. For those who don't know, Inverter's turn the D.C. electrical current from the sun into an A.C. current, which is used by households. The inverter business is also much higher margin than the module (panel) business, due to there being fewer players in the industry. They are also expanding into energy storage and electric vehicle manufacturing. \n\nMy bull case around SolarEdge is around their market dominance in the Solar Inverter business, which will grow exponentially in the coming years plus future expansion in storage &amp; EVs. They have a very strong management team as well. \n\n--------------------------\n\nTPI composites (TPIC)\n\nhttps://ir.tpicomposites.com/download/companies/tpicomposites/Supplements/TPI%20Earnings%20Deck%202Q20.pdf\n\nTPI composites manufacturers wind blades and sells them to wind turbine companies. They have long term contracts with the top 5 non Chinese wind turbine companies (Vestas, GE, Siemens, Nordex &amp; Enercon.) 63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with a certain EV company that I can't mention on this subreddit apparently (DM if you want more info) to manufacture vehicle parts for them.\n\n-------------------\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH) \n\nhttps://investor.enphase.com/static-files/81902e59-7d61-4693-aa86-8d54e63975b9\n\nEnphase is the sole producer of Microinverters, which are smaller inverters that go on individual panels and provide a safer, more efficient, but more expensive solution than the standard string inverters. Microinverters are used in smaller solar systems, mostly residential. They also have an energy storage business that is just starting to scale. Enphase and SolarEdge are competitors in both of these spaces, and are expected to be major players in the future. Like SolarEdge, Enphases' inverter business is high margin and expects rapid future growth, as the residential solar market grows. \n\nMy bullish case around Enphase is around their Microinverter technology, potential for expansion into storage and unique Ensamble home energy management system (read about Ensamble on the Investor relations page). \n\n-----------------------\n\nBrookfield Renewables (BEPC)\n\nBrookfield Renewables owns and operates renewable energy systems and projects. They sell energy produced from such systems to utility companies and have a recurring revenue stream. They also pay a 3.73% dividend yield. Their investments are split relatively evenly between Hydroelectric, solar and wind. \n\nMy bullish thesis around BEPC is the consistent cash flow positive revenue stream and relative safety in the business model. Also, they provide be with exposure to hydroelectric energy. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nLet me know if you have any comments, hold, or plan to buy any of these companies!", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 797110, "public", "self", "A guide for those looking to invest in Renewable Energy.

In addition to the normal stuff, it also provides adjustments for dividend reinvestments (and the relevant taxes on those dividends), as well as tax implications for selling. Short and long holding periods are considered automatically.\n\nThe function takes the following  arguments\n\n**data** \\- a data.frame with named columns *PurchaseDate*, *Quantity*, *CostPerShare*, *DivReInvest*, and *CapGainsRate*. Entries in the *DivReInvest* column take a value of 1 if the purchase was a dividend reinvestment, and 0 if it was not a dividend reinvestment. The CapGainsRate value will typically be the capital gains tax rate applicable *for the year of purchase*. In the event that a lot was purchased so recently income tax rates apply, use your marginal income tax rate for the specified value.\n\n**cgr** \\- Your capital gains tax rate for date specified with *date* argument.\n\n**itr** \\- Your current marginal income tax rate\n\n**price** \\- the market share price for the date specified with  *date* argument. Defaults to current date.\n\nThe output of the function is a list with two elements. The first element is an enhanced version of the data.frame passed as *data*. As before, each row represents one lot. The second element is a summary of the entire position with some useful information that can be tedious to calculate manually.\n\nFirst, I've built the table with the basic lot data below for a hypothetical investment in AAPL. In practice, all of the columns but Ticker, DivReInvest, and CapGainsRate are copied from from the individual lots view of my Fidelity account (as accessed via Safari on MacOS), into a Numbers spreadsheet.

In addition to the normal stuff, it also provides adjustments for dividend reinvestments (and the relevant taxes on those dividends), as well as tax implications for selling. Short and long holding periods are considered automatically.\n\nThe function takes the following  arguments\n\n**data** \\- a data.frame with named columns *PurchaseDate*, *Quantity*, *CostPerShare*, *DivReInvest*, and *CapGainsRate*. Entries in the *DivReInvest* column take a value of 1 if the purchase was a dividend reinvestment, and 0 if it was not a dividend reinvestment. The CapGainsRate value will typically be the capital gains tax rate applicable *for the year of purchase*. In the event that a lot was purchased so recently income tax rates apply, use your marginal income tax rate for the specified value.\n\n**cgr** \\- Your capital gains tax rate for date specified with *date* argument.\n\n**itr** \\- Your current marginal income tax rate\n\n**price** \\- the market share price for the date specified with  *date* argument. Defaults to current date.\n\nThe output of the function is a list with two elements. The first element is an enhanced version of the data.frame passed as *data*. As before, each row represents one lot. The second element is a summary of the entire position with some useful information that can be tedious to calculate manually.\n\nFirst, I've built the table with the basic lot data below for a hypothetical investment in AAPL. In practice, all of the columns but Ticker, DivReInvest, and CapGainsRate are copied from from the individual lots view of my Fidelity account (as accessed via Safari on MacOS), into a Numbers spreadsheet. I change the column headers, delete unwanted columns, and add a column each for *CapGainsRate* and *DivReInvest*. From there, I save it, and import it into `R`.\n\n    # Build a hypothetical stock position.\n    \n    aapl = data.frame(Ticker = rep(\"AAPL\", 8),\n                      PurchaseDate = c(\"2019-01-03\", \"2019-02-08\", \"2019-05-10\",\n                                       \"2019-08-09\", \"2019-11-07\", \"2020-02-07\",\n                                       \"2020-05-08\", \"2020-08-07\"),\n                      Quantity = c(100, 0.436, 0.392, 0.386, 0.300, 0.244, 0.269, 0.188),\n                      CostPerShare = c(142.19, 167.45, 197.18, 200.99,\n                                       259.43, 320.03, 310.13, 444.45),\n                      DivReInvest = c(0, rep(1, 7)),\n                      CapGainsRate = rep(0.15, 8))\n\nHere is the function:\n\n    analyzePosition = function(data, cgr = 0.15, itr = 0.3, price, date = Sys.Date()) {\n    \tdata$PurchaseDate = as.Date(data$PurchaseDate)\n    \tdata$LongHoldDate = data$PurchaseDate + 365\n    \tdata$CostBasis = round(data$Quantity * data$CostPerShare, digits = 2)\n    \tdata$AdjCostBasis = round(ifelse(data$DivReInvest == 1,\n                                             data$CapGainsRate * data$CostBasis,\n                                             data$CostBasis),\n                                      digits = 2)\n    \tdata$PresentValue = round(data$Quantity * price, digits = 2)\n    \tdata$UnrealizedGain =\n                round(data$PresentValue - data$CostBasis, digits = 2)\n    \tdata$AdjUnrealizedGain =\n                round(data$PresentValue - data$AdjCostBasis, digits = 2)\n    \tdata$LiquidationTax = round(ifelse(data$LongHoldDate &gt; date,\n                                               data$UnrealizedGain * itr,\n                                               data$UnrealizedGain * cgr),\n                                        digits = 2)\n    \tdata$LiquidValue = data$PresentValue - data$LiquidationTax\n    \tdata$LiquidValuePerShare = round(data$LiquidValue / data$Quantity,\n                                             digits = 2)\n    \tdata$GainPercentage = round(100 * data$UnrealizedGain / data$CostBasis,\n                                        digits = 2)\n    \tdata$AdjGainPercentage =\n                round(100 * (data$PresentValue / data$AdjCostBasis - 1), digits = 2)\n    \n    \tcostBasis = sum(data$CostBasis)\n    \tadjCostBasis = sum(data$AdjCostBasis)\n    \tpresentValue = sum(data$PresentValue)\n    \tunrealizedGain = sum(data$UnrealizedGain)\n    \tnetDivReInvest = costBasis - adjCostBasis\n    \tunrealizedTaxLiability = sum(data$LiquidationTax)\n    \tliquidNetValue = presentValue - unrealizedTaxLiability\n    \tliquidationNetProfit = liquidNetValue - costBasis\n    \tadjLiquidationNetProfit = liquidNetValue - adjCostBasis\n    \tunrealizedGainPercent =\n                ifelse(costBasis != 0, 100 * unrealizedGain / costBasis, NA)\n    \tadjUnrealizedGainPercent =\n    \t    ifelse(adjCostBasis != 0, 100 * (presentValue / adjCostBasis - 1), NA)\n    \tunrealizedNetGainPercent =\n    \t    ifelse(costBasis != 0, 100 * liquidationNetProfit / costBasis, NA)\n    \tadjUnrealizedNetGainPercent =\n    \t    ifelse(adjCostBasis != 0,\n                       100 * adjLiquidationNetProfit / adjCostBasis,\n                       NA)\n    \treEntryPrice = ifelse(unrealizedGain &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; sum(data$Quantity) != 0,\n                                  price - sum(data$LiquidationTax) / sum(data$Quantity),\n                                  NA)\n    \t\n    \tout = data.frame(SummaryStatistic = c(\"Cost Basis\",\n                                                  \"Reinvested After-tax Dividends\",\n                                                  \"Adjusted Cost Basis\",\n                                                  \"Present Market Value\",\n                                                  \"Current Market Share Price\",\n                                                  \"Unrealized Gain (Pre-tax)\",\n                                                  \"Unrealized Pre-tax Gain (%)\",\n                                                  \"Adjusted Unrealized Pre-tax Gain (%)\",\n                                                  \"\",\n                                                  \"Unrealized Tax Liability\",\n                                                  \"Position Value (After-tax)\",\n                                                  \"Unrealized Gain (After-tax)\",\n                                                  \"Adjusted Unrealized Gain (After-tax)\",\n                                                  \"Unrealized After-tax Gain (%)\",\n                                                  \"Adj.

I'm gonna go in depth on what I've learned over the past 4 years trading IPOs, and share with you a strategy that I really nailed down in the past few months.\n\nI'm specifically talking about buying an stock on the day of the IPO once the stock starts trading. For most of us who do not have substantial capital in our accounts, or whose brokers don't get access to many IPOs at the listing price, the best we can do is buy the stock once it is actively trading on the open market (the 'debut').\n\nWhile it sounds pretty straight forward, buying a stock on the day of its IPO is rather tricky, since you don't know exactly when it will start trading, or at what price it will actually debut on the open market, and since the price often moves very quickly once it starts trading, you want to be able to buy in as soon as possible, especially for a super hot IPO - and there IS a way to get stock the minute it debuts on the market.\n\nTo give you an idea of what you can accomplish - in the LMND, NCNO, and BIGC IPOs, you could relatively easily made about 50% on your money on each of these within a day of the IPO.\n\nIMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND - not every IPO is going to soar, you need to be selective, you need to take precautions to limit your downside, and the goal here is to make the right moves on a stock that DOES take off once it debuts off it's IPO while not losing money, or at least limiting your losses, when the IPO is a dud.\n\nFirst, some quick background info to get everyone up to speed, since it does help to prepare you for playing the IPO the day a stock debuts trading:\n\nAn IPO (Initial Public Offering) is the process by which a private company, often a startup, initially lists their company's shares for sale on the public markets. The purpose of this is typically for a company to raise money - they sell shares to the public and use the proceeds from those sold shares to grow their business. Another reason a company will 'go public' is so that employees, investors, and owners of the company can realize a capital gain (make money) from the stock they own/have earned as they founded and grew out the company.\n\nTraditionally, a company will hire established Investment Banks to promote their IPO to institutional investors (pension funds, hedge funds, etc), in order to build out a substantial base of buyers who will purchase the shares offered in the IPO. In the weeks leading up to the IPO, the company's executive team will meet with these investors and pitch their business in order to drum up support for the IPO, and these large investors will 'subscribe' to buy a certain number of shares within an expected price range, which is ultimately determined usually the day of the IPO.\n\nThe day of the IPO.So going into the day of a major IPO, you know the range of the IPO price and you know the company will list that day, but you don't know what the debut price will be or when the stock will start trading, and this is your biggest initial challenge.\n\nI'm already assuming the stocks I want to use this strategy for are creating a pretty big buzz in the media and social networks, so my expectation is that they will pop once they start trading. This means that within a few minutes of trading, the stock will already likely have shot up a few dollars or more, so you really want to get in right away.\n\nKEY ENTRY STRATEGY: Set a LIMIT ORDER for a couple of dollars above the Ask Price of the stock, so you are ensured to get shares right when the stock debuts.\n\nYou will need to keep an eye on the movement of the Ask price every 5 minutes or so until you see the price start to stabilize - since you don't know exactly when the stock will start trading, you're going to need to babysit this for as long as a couple hours: adjusting your Limit Order price according to the Ask price (there are apps that can show you this key info in real time).\n\nFor example, the BIGC IPO price was $24, but the debut price started at $70 and then came down to $55 and bounced around a bit. So when the Ask price shows $55, you set your Limit Order for $57; when it goes up to $60, you adjust your Limit Order to $63. If you're like me, you're throwing all your available funds at this thing, so you need to adjust the amount of shares you want to purchase in relation to the price change.\n\nYou really have to stay on top of this, because the price can swing pretty fast, and you want to optimize the number of shares you get.\n\nFor those who don't understand Limit Orders: a Limit Order (BUY) is basically saying that you agree to pay UP TO $X.XX for the stock.\n\nAt some point, the stock will just start trading. There is no real warning, although you can sort of get a feel for it when the swings in price start getting incrementally smaller.\n\nIF you kept your limit price above the Ask price, you SHOULD get bought in almost exactly at the debut price once the stock starts trading. If you managed to do this properly - great, for the type of IPO we're looking for, you got in at the lowest point possible.\n\nSo that covers the first part - getting INTO your trade at the optimal price - for home run IPO debuts, the price typically goes straight up.\n\n\\+++\n\nOkay, now I'm gonna stop for a minute and talk minimizing your loss potential for when a stock does NOT go right up off the debut. Not every IPO is gonna explode, and in order to be in position to capitalize on the ones that DO explode, you're probably gonna have to play a bunch of them that are duds or just don't rocket right off the launch ramp.\n\nFor every LMND and NCNO there's a RLAY, QH, BLCT, and BLI. Granted, some of these turned out to be potential wins (BLI and RLAY), but not at the level of LMND/NCNO/BIGC - and a couple of them fell pretty significantly right after they IPOd. Even just last week, RXT did a nosedive which would have garnered a 20% loss or worse.\n\nThe good news is, that almost all of these stocks experienced a slight bump in the first few minutes after they debuted. If I'm not incredibly confident in a stock, I'm gonna set a Stop Loss either right at my entry point or slightly below it. If it get's triggered, oh well, either no loss or a small loss, and I just accept that even if the stock recovers, at least I haven't lost money. The real winners with huge gains are usually obvious from the start.\n\nI'm gonna say this again just to make my point. Set your Stop Loss for whatever amount you feel comfortable losing, and do it right away. It's okay to lose a little. The home run plays don't do a big dip right out the gate - they run off pretty much straight from the starting line. You really don't want to be sweating it out while a stock dittles around the debut price for the day.\n\nOne mistake I made with the LMND and NCNO IPOs was raising my Stop Loss amount as the stock popped. Had I simply left my Stop Loss at my entry point, it would not have been triggered at all, but raising it incrementally as the stock price shot up caused it to get triggered on a down swing before the stocks ultimately went far beyond the initial spike.\n\nThe anatomy of the stock charts for the home run plays look very similar, particularly in the first 30 minutes of trading. A big jump off the debut price, with an initial spike. BIGC triggered two circuit breakers on the way from $68 to $93 before coming back down to the low $70s before climbing up to $103 the next day. LMND and NCNO followed similar paths. You might consider just selling out a portion or all of your stock on the initial spike, but for the real home run plays, you'll be leaving money on the table if you sell of the initial spike.\n\nHAVING A GAME PLAN\n\nJust as it's a good idea to set your Stop Limit to control your acceptable loss, it helps to define your expectations for what you envision as a 'win'. It's not easy to time these things to perfection, so if you have some idea as to how much you would be happy to walk away with, you can exit your position if/when your target is reached, and be happy regardless of what the share price does from there.\n\nFor BIGC, $100 was my target, and I got out at $100.25. Once it went over $100 I set my stop at $100, and brought it up to $100.50 when it went to $101.00 - I got stopped out as it dropped back down from there.\n\nTo clarify that strategy: once your target price is met, instead of just selling at Market Price, set a Limit Order and see if it runs a little, while raising your limit behind the price until you get stopped out. You can also sell out in phases to average out your exit point. While I don't normally do this, it is a sensible approach.\n\nI find that these stocks typically make a run at the end of the IPO day, and often push higher the next day. While there is no way to predict this for certain, remember that you're looking for the home run IPOs, and will inevitably play some dud IPOs along the way. The point is to NOT LOSE MONEY on the duds, while maximizing the value of the home runs.\n\nKnowing how to read candle style charts might help you define your exit point as well, but is by no means necessary.\n\nAnd another note: when you really nail it, you might consider holding onto a few shares of the stock - basically free stock - if you really believe in the company. For example, I bought in for 520 shares of BIGC @$68 and sold 470 shares @$100.25 (+$15,157.50), and kept 50 shares (@$100/share this would be $5,000).\n\nEdit: Since first writing this piece, BIGC has come down considerably, so the shares I held onto are worth a bit less: but they were essentially paid for out of the winnings and I expect this company to be valuable long term.Playing RKT the following day would have netted a pretty big win as well, but I was too amped to focus... something for me to work on as well.\n\nI'll be trying the same approach with BEKE, XPEV, and CVAC this week, with high hopes for DCT...\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions, play along, or give me further pointers on how I can refine my strategy.\n\nBest of luck!", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 788075, "public", "self", "How to Play IPO Debuts for Profit (repost without banned links)", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i7su8h/how_to_play_ipo_debuts_for_profit_repost_without/", "all_ads", 6, 1597152640.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "hammondish", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8yfwnkd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597156240, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i7su8h/how_to_play_ipo_debuts_for_profit_repost_without/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i7su8h", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "advice", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "823be0a6-65e6-11e5-9784-125ee764bc01", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 33, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/i7su8h/how_to_play_ipo_debuts_for_profit_repost_without/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1597156250, "score": 1, "selftext": " \n\nThe main reason I'm writing this, is because during last week's BigCommerce IPO, there were a lot of question on how to play the IPO once the stock hit the market, ranging from \"When does the stock start trading\", to \"How much will it cost when it debuts\", to \"Why is the debut price so much higher than the stated IPO price?\"...\n\nI made $20k on a $35 investment on BigCommerce (Turned $35k into $55k), and have now played 7 IPOs without a loss, but this was the first one I really nailed.

Before recommending an energy future, it's important to know that oil prices have cycles.  Currently, we are at the beginning of a new cycle, which means any investment into an oil company with satisfactory fundamentals will lend you a large return.  The competition for oil has been stretched thin with several oil companies going bankrupt during the pandemic; OPEC+ and outside oil companies have significantly driven the price of oil up via cuts on oil production; many people remain just as financially stable or a lot more from pre-pandemic oil demand levels, due to relief funds, equities market trading/investing, a massive increase in e-commerce jobs, and an increase demand for frontline worker jobs.  With an impending mass vaccination set to occur at the end of the year, well practiced social distancing measures, well practiced tracing methods, and noticeable downtrends in covid cases, buying recovery futures is generally a well considered idea.  If we trace back to the post SARS outbreak and \"911 attack\", we notice business jet sales skyrocketed.  The difference between the SARS outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic is the extend of persons afflicted by cabin fever, the amount of successful vaccines to likely flood the market throughout the next few quarters, the extent of relief funds, and a thinning of competition among oil companies. Moveover, there has a been a massive amount of inquiries into business jets over the course of the pandemic.  The fact of the matter is that the rich have cabin-fever, money, and are more eager to take private jets than commercial jets on travel.  In fact, the magnitude of cabin-fever is so great that there was a 6% increase commercial air traffic last week.

Before recommending an energy future, it's important to know that oil prices have cycles.  Currently, we are at the beginning of a new cycle, which means any investment into an oil company with satisfactory fundamentals will lend you a large return.  The competition for oil has been stretched thin with several oil companies going bankrupt during the pandemic; OPEC+ and outside oil companies have significantly driven the price of oil up via cuts on oil production; many people remain just as financially stable or a lot more from pre-pandemic oil demand levels, due to relief funds, equities market trading/investing, a massive increase in e-commerce jobs, and an increase demand for frontline worker jobs.  With an impending mass vaccination set to occur at the end of the year, well practiced social distancing measures, well practiced tracing methods, and noticeable downtrends in covid cases, buying recovery futures is generally a well considered idea.  If we trace back to the post SARS outbreak and \"911 attack\", we notice business jet sales skyrocketed.  The difference between the SARS outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic is the extend of persons afflicted by cabin fever, the amount of successful vaccines to likely flood the market throughout the next few quarters, the extent of relief funds, and a thinning of competition among oil companies. Moveover, there has a been a massive amount of inquiries into business jets over the course of the pandemic.  The fact of the matter is that the rich have cabin-fever, money, and are more eager to take private jets than commercial jets on travel.  In fact, the magnitude of cabin-fever is so great that there was a 6% increase commercial air traffic last week.  As borders and flight paths continue to open, COVID 19 cases continue to drop, and new vaccines continue to appear, we can expect as massive spike in air traffic.  What about the upcoming U.S. elections?  A Trump win will raise all the prices of oil futures via sustained/increased oil consuming products, increased oil drilling, and increased pipelines.

I'm gonna go in depth on what I've learned over the past 4 years trading IPOs, and share with you a strategy that I really nailed down in the past few months.\n\nI'm specifically talking about buying an stock on the day of the IPO once the stock starts trading. For most of us who do not have substantial capital in our accounts, or whose brokers don't get access to many IPOs at the listing price, the best we can do is buy the stock once it is actively trading on the open market (the 'debut').\n\nWhile it sounds pretty straight forward, buying a stock on the day of its IPO is rather tricky, since you don't know exactly when it will start trading, or at what price it will actually debut on the open market, and since the price often moves very quickly once it starts trading, you want to be able to buy in as soon as possible, especially for a super hot IPO - and there IS a way to get stock the minute it debuts on the market.\n\nTo give you an idea of what you can accomplish - in the LMND, NCNO, and BIGC IPOs, you could relatively easily made about 50% on your money on each of these within a day of the IPO.\n\nIMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND - not every IPO is going to soar, you need to be selective, you need to take precautions to limit your downside, and the goal here is to make the right moves on a stock that DOES take off once it debuts off it's IPO while not losing money, or at least limiting your losses, when the IPO is a dud.\n\nFirst, some quick background info to get everyone up to speed, since it does help to prepare you for playing the IPO the day a stock debuts trading:\n\nAn IPO (Initial Public Offering) is the process by which a private company, often a startup, initially lists their company's shares for sale on the public markets. The purpose of this is typically for a company to raise money - they sell shares to the public and use the proceeds from those sold shares to grow their business. Another reason a company will 'go public' is so that employees, investors, and owners of the company can realize a capital gain (make money) from the stock they own/have earned as they founded and grew out the company.\n\nTraditionally, a company will hire established Investment Banks to promote their IPO to institutional investors (pension funds, hedge funds, etc), in order to build out a substantial base of buyers who will purchase the shares offered in the IPO. In the weeks leading up to the IPO, the company's executive team will meet with these investors and pitch their business in order to drum up support for the IPO, and these large investors will 'subscribe' to buy a certain number of shares within an expected price range, which is ultimately determined usually the day of the IPO.\n\nThe day of the IPO.So going into the day of a major IPO, you know the range of the IPO price and you know the company will list that day, but you don't know what the debut price will be or when the stock will start trading, and this is your biggest initial challenge.\n\nI'm already assuming the stocks I want to use this strategy for are creating a pretty big buzz in the media and social networks, so my expectation is that they will pop once they start trading. This means that within a few minutes of trading, the stock will already likely have shot up a few dollars or more, so you really want to get in right away.\n\nKEY ENTRY STRATEGY: Set a LIMIT ORDER for a couple of dollars above the Ask Price of the stock, so you are ensured to get shares right when the stock debuts.\n\nYou will need to keep an eye on the movement of the Ask price every 5 minutes or so until you see the price start to stabilize - since you don't know exactly when the stock will start trading, you're going to need to babysit this for as long as a couple hours: adjusting your Limit Order price according to the Ask price.\n\n(I only know of one app that provides this information in real time, DM me for details if interested, as promoting apps is not permitted on this thread.)\n\nFor example, the BIGC IPO price was $24, but the debut price started at $70 and then came down to $55 and bounced around a bit.  So when the Ask price shows $55, you set your Limit Order for $57; when it goes up to $60, you adjust your Limit Order to $63. If you're like me, you're throwing all your available funds at this thing, so you need to adjust the amount of shares you want to purchase in relation to the price change.\n\nYou really have to stay on top of this, because the price can swing pretty fast, and you want to optimize the number of shares you get.\n\nFor those who don't understand Limit Orders: a Limit Order (BUY) is basically saying that you agree to pay UP TO $X.XX for the stock.\n\nAt some point, the stock will just start trading. There is no real warning, although you can sort of get a feel for it when the swings in price start getting incrementally smaller.\n\nIF you kept your limit price above the Ask price, you SHOULD get bought in almost exactly at the debut price once the stock starts trading. If you managed to do this properly - great, for the type of IPO we're looking for, you got in at the lowest point possible.\n\nSo that covers the first part - getting INTO your trade at the optimal price - for home run IPO debuts, the price typically goes straight up.\n\n\\+++\n\nOkay, now I'm gonna stop for a minute and talk minimizing your loss potential for when a stock does NOT go right up off the debut. Not every IPO is gonna explode, and in order to be in position to capitalize on the ones that DO explode, you're probably gonna have to play a bunch of them that are duds or just don't rocket right off the launch ramp.\n\nFor every LMND and NCNO there's a RLAY, QH, BLCT, and BLI. Granted, some of these turned out to be potential wins (BLI and RLAY), but not at the level of LMND/NCNO/BIGC - and a couple of them fell pretty significantly right after they IPOd. Even just last week, RXT did a nosedive which would have garnered a 20% loss or worse.\n\nThe good news is, that almost all of these stocks experienced a slight bump in the first few minutes after they debuted. If I'm not incredibly confident in a stock, I'm gonna set a Stop Loss either right at my entry point or slightly below it. If it get's triggered, oh well, either no loss or a small loss, and I just accept that even if the stock recovers, at least I haven't lost money. The real winners with huge gains are usually obvious from the start.\n\nI'm gonna say this again just to make my point. Set your Stop Loss for whatever amount you feel comfortable losing, and do it right away. It's okay to lose a little. The home run plays don't do a big dip right out the gate - they run off pretty much straight from the starting line. You really don't want to be sweating it out while a stock dittles around the debut price for the day.\n\nOne mistake I made with the LMND and NCNO IPOs was raising my Stop Loss amount as the stock popped. Had I simply left my Stop Loss at my entry point, it would not have been triggered at all, but raising it incrementally as the stock price shot up caused it to get triggered on a down swing before the stocks ultimately went far beyond the initial spike.\n\nThe anatomy of the stock charts for the home run plays look very similar, particularly in the first 30 minutes of trading. A big jump off the debut price, with an initial spike.  BIGC triggered two circuit breakers on the way from $68 to $93 before coming back down to the low $70s before climbing up to $103 the next day. LMND and NCNO followed similar paths. You might consider just selling out a portion or all of your stock on the initial spike, but for the real home run plays, you'll be leaving money on the table if you sell of the initial spike.\n\nHAVING A GAME PLAN\n\nJust as it's a good idea to set your Stop Limit to control your acceptable loss, it helps to define your expectations for what you envision as a 'win'. It's not easy to time these things to perfection, so if you have some idea as to how much you would be happy to walk away with, you can exit your position if/when your target is reached, and be happy regardless of what the share price does from there.\n\nFor BIGC, $100 was my target, and I got out at $100.25.  Once it went over $100 I set my stop at $100, and brought it up to $100.50 when it went to $101.00 - I got stopped out as it dropped back down from there.\n\nTo clarify that strategy: once your target price is met, instead of just selling at Market Price, set a Limit Order and see if it runs a little, while raising your limit behind the price until you get stopped out. You can also sell out in phases to average out your exit point. While I don't normally do this, it is a sensible approach.\n\nI find that these stocks typically make a run at the end of the IPO day, and often push higher the next day. While there is no way to predict this for certain, remember that you're looking for the home run IPOs, and will inevitably play some dud IPOs along the way. The point is to NOT LOSE MONEY on the duds, while maximizing the value of the home runs.\n\nKnowing how to read candle style charts might help you define your exit point as well, but is by no means necessary.\n\nAnd another note: when you really nail it, you might consider holding onto a few shares of the stock - basically free stock - if you really believe in the company. For example, I bought in for 520 shares of BIGC @$68 and sold 470 shares @$100.25 (+$15,157.50), and kept 50 shares (@$100/share this would be $5,000).\n\nEdit: Since first writing this piece, BIGC has come down considerably, so the shares I held onto are worth a bit less: but they were essentially paid for out of the winnings and I expect this company to be valuable long term.  \nPlaying RKT the following day would have netted a pretty big win as well, but I was too amped to focus... something for me to work on as well.\n\nI'll be trying the same approach with BEKE, XPEV, and CVAC this week, with high hopes for DCT...\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions, play along, or give me further pointers on how I can refine my strategy.\n\nBest of luck!", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 787441, "public", "self", "How to Successfully Play New IPO Debuts", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i7iwjd/how_to_successfully_play_new_ipo_debuts/", "all_ads", 6, 1597107762.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "hammondish", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8yfwnkd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597111362, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i7iwjd/how_to_successfully_play_new_ipo_debuts/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i7iwjd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "advice", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "823be0a6-65e6-11e5-9784-125ee764bc01", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 55, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/i7iwjd/how_to_successfully_play_new_ipo_debuts/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1597111373, "score": 1, "selftext": "(reposting this without naming the specific tools I use to track the pre-debut sale price of stocks before they start trading on the day of their IPO, per the rules of this forum: DM me if you want to know specifics --- sorry, it's kind of long, I know, but I wanted to share this strategy).\n\nThe main reason I'm writing this, is because during last week's BigCommerce IPO, there were a lot of question on how to play the IPO once the stock hit the market, ranging from \"When does the stock start trading\", to \"How much will it cost when it debuts\", to \"Why is the debut price so much higher than the stated IPO price?\"... \n\nI made $20k on a $35 investment on BigCommerce, and have now played 7 IPOs without a loss, but this was the first one I really nailed.

For example, I bought in for 520 shares of BIGC @$68 and sold 470 shares @$100.25 (+$15,157.50), and kept 50 shares (@$100/share this would be $5,000).\n\nEdit: Since first writing this piece, BIGC has come down considerably, so the shares I held onto are worth a bit less: but they were essentially paid for out of the winnings and I expect this company to be valuable long term.  \nPlaying RKT the following day would have netted a pretty big win as well, but I was too amped to focus... something for me to work on as well.\n\nI'll be trying the same approach with BEKE, XPEV, and CVAC this week, with high hopes for DCT...\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions, play along, or give me further pointers on how I can refine my strategy.\n\nBest of luck!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 787441, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to Successfully Play New IPO Debuts", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i7iwjd/how_to_successfully_play_new_ipo_debuts/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1597107762.0}], [[], false, "radarbot", null, [], null, "text", "t2_13xxx6", false, false, [], false, false, 1596851797, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i5qv5i/how_to_value_a_company_like_crsp/", {}, "i5qv5i", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "tickerdiscussion", [], "612ee368-65e6-11e5-b53f-129e4297eb59", "Ticker Discussion", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 23, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/i5qv5i/how_to_value_a_company_like_crsp/", false, 6, 1596851808, 1, "CRSP did their quarterly reports two weeks ago and had wider than expected earnings. But the more I dug into this company, the harder it became to value them. This seems to be a common trend in ARK investments, as TSLA and SQ pose a very similar challenge.\n\nLet me get into it in my detail:\n\nCRSP is company that was created upon the technology founded by Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier. While at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, she was able to identify a way to target specific sections of DNA. This discovery was productized and is now known as CRSPR/Cas9. Not to be mistaken for the company which is Crispr Therapeutics.\n\nCRSPR/Cas9 is a combination of a RNA (the CRSPR part) and Cas9 (the enyzme that targets cells part). The combination of these two components enters cells and then specifically deactivates certain DNA sequences and replaces them with inactive elements. This allows the treatment to effectively \"cure\" certain illnesses. They can do this in-vivo (ie. on a live patient) or ex-vivo (ie. in a blood sample that is transfused into a live patient).\n\nRight now, CRSP has 4 areas of focus:\n\n1. Blood diseases - ie. Sickle Cell\n\n2. Oncology - ie. CAR-T treatment using stem cells\n\n3. Regenerative Medicine - ie. Type 1diabetes\n\n4. In Vivo Approaches - ie. MD and CF\n\n\nEach of these areas has different candidate solutions that are in various stages of clinical trials. The furthest along are the blood disease and oncology treatments. The results of those are proving to be promising based on the findings within the quarterly reports.\n\nNow here's the biggest problem I have with all this. If you read any of the articles about CRSP, they focus on revenues, earnings and profit. CRSP has no products on the market. They currently only make income through what they call \"collaborative revenue\". They currently partner with three companies to develop the treatments above:\n\n1. Vertex\n\n2. Viacyte\n\n3. Bayer\n\nTheir revenues year-over-year are exclusively based on these companies giving them money to continue their research. CRSP runs up significant debt, as any highly speculative pharma company would do as almost all their spending is on R&amp;D. CRSP has no marketing team, no sales team, no quotas, no product. I would even venture as far as to say that the total-available-market assessment of their technology is nebulous as well. We could probably find the total number of individuals within the world with Sickle Cell Disease, but how many of them would be able to afford or receive such a novel and progressive treatment as CRSP is proposing? This is truly disruptive, so valuing this company becomes hard!\n\nIt brings me to my core question. How do you value a company like CRSP? Looking at current net income is completely worthless. Their revenue streams are basically funny money paid by their partnerships to continue research. As an example, in 2017 they maid $40M in collaboration revenue. In 2018 they made $3M. In 2019 they made $290M. In 2019, they posted their first profitable year and had net income of $66M.\n\nIn comparison, their 2020 6months collaboration revenue was $201k compared to $646k last year. They're on track to post a HUGE loss this year as their research and development spending this year is 1.5x as much as last year with their collaboration revenue down by one-third.\n\nAnd again, this is funny money! If Bayer or Vertex or Viacyte wanted, they could easily just dump 250M into CRSP and make them profitable. One thing I did find, that could have an impact on the stock price, CRSP tends to see their largest quarter collaborative revenue cash infusion in Q3. In 2019 and 2018, thats when they got huge sums of money. In 2019, they made $211M of their $290M collaborative revenue in Q3. In 2018, they made $500k of their $3M collaborative revenue in Q3.\n\n\nSo getting back to my core question: Analysts seem to be focusing all their articles and price targets  only on revenue numbers. Which doesn't make sense for this company...\n\nAs a individual investor, how would you go about valuing a company like this to understand the \"right price to enter a position\"? Given this is all funny money, I feel the only way to enter CRSP is through pure DCA if you fundamentally believe in their technology. And then keep a close eye on their trial results, and watch the price action based on the results to create your own individual model of CRSP's valuation.\n\nAnyone else have any ideas?", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 783344, "public", "self", "How to value a company like CRSP?", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i5qv5i/how_to_value_a_company_like_crsp/", "all_ads", 6, 1596848197.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "radarbot", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_13xxx6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1596851797, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i5qv5i/how_to_value_a_company_like_crsp/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i5qv5i", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "tickerdiscussion", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "612ee368-65e6-11e5-b53f-129e4297eb59", "link_flair_text": "Ticker Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 23, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/i5qv5i/how_to_value_a_company_like_crsp/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1596851808, "score": 1, "selftext": "CRSP did their quarterly reports two weeks ago and had wider than expected earnings.

TransUnion, SiriusIQ and UST Global are partnering up to make a joint venture company called CLX Health LLC. CLX Health LLC is introducing an app called Healthy America\u2122\ufe0f  that is set to be announced on August 6th to the world. The media will be disclosing it at 3pm EDT on August 6th. \n\nWhat does it even do?\nThis link provides all the information you need without having to read all of that down there:\nhttps://solutions.transunion.com/healthy-america/resources/file/healthy-america-project-plan-2020.pdf\n    \nMessage from TransUnion on Healthy America:\n\nIn a world forever changed by the COVID-19 crisis, we\u2019re committed to protecting American lives. TransUnion and its US-based healthcare technology partners have developed HealthyAmericaTM. This unique solution enables people to securely share test results, helping businesses, schools and consumers assess risks stemming from COVID-19 and interact in a safe, confident manner.\nHealthyAmerica combines the power of TransUnion\u2019s identity and fraud solutions, clinical data management capabilities of SiriusIQ, and business transformation assets of UST Global \u2014 together forming CLX Health, LLC. By leveraging and deploying our existing technology in a way consumers and businesses can readily adopt, it will be easier to mitigate risk in everyday interactions while maintaining individual privacy. Going forward, we expect airlines, large event organizers, restaurants and others will leverage the tool \u2014 which will easily adapt to changes in science parameters, including the evolution of a seasonal vaccine.\n(https://solutions.transunion.com/healthy-america/?=undefined)\n\nWhat Healthy America is:\n\nCLX Health LLC, a joint venture company, has developed the HealthyAmericaTM mobile application to be deployed as a key component of the HealthyAmericaTM Solution Architecture and Database. The CLX Consortium of partner companies have come together to manage the spread of COVID-19 and other viruses by accessing real-time laboratory testing data for operational business and consumer decision support, ultimately allowing the economy to scale back up to capacity.\nUtilizing existing technology and infrastructure critical to delivering a solution now, the CLX Consortium has network access to over 1 million physician offices, 22 largest by volume clinical laboratories, 40 major hospital systems and 20 Federally Qualified Health Clinics (FQHC) in the United States.\nIn much the same way TSA PreCheckTM provided airline passengers with an increased level of confidence after 9/11, the HealthyAmerica application is positioned to mitigate risk of businesses and individuals. With TSA PreCheck in place, passengers returned to travel with assurance that fellow travelers had been screened and posed little to no risk. The HealthyAmerica application manages real-time and batch files of health status requests for consumers to provide businesses and facilities operational decision-making capabilities that can mitigate exposure to employees and clients.\nLike the TSA PreCheck status, which is delivered in bulk to airlines and directly to the consumer via a Quick Response (QR) code, HealthyAmerica enables consumers to present a QR code indicating health status. With the HealthyAmerica QR code, individuals can securely gain access to government-restricted sites, such as airports and/or sporting events, as examples.\nThe HealthyAmerica application works in the following manner, first requiring the individual consumer to register. Consumer identity is verified in combination with mobile device authentication, then the consumer selects a laboratory, schedules testing and receives validated test results\u2014all within the application on the consumer\u2019s verified device. The HealthyAmerica application stores diagnostic or antibodies test results received directly from an FDA-approved laboratory and generates a QR code indicating current health status.(https://www.siriusiq.com/siriusiq-introduces-clx-health-and-develops-healthyamerica-tm-as-virus-response-mobile-application/)\nMy summary and analysis:\n\nOkay so this app basically gives verification to other people on whether you have Covid-19 or not wherever you go. First you start off by scheduling a testing through the app for antibodies and then you send the tests to SiriusIQ labs where they see if you have antibodies. TransUnion then verifies your identity through your social security number making sure it\u2019s you. Then the data is stored in the app which is federally regulated and presents proof of your safety from Covid-19. You can also opt in or not for contact tracing on it to see who is infected and not. I think businesses, airports and big events like baseball games will soon require this because it\u2018s as simple as scanning a QR code or sending a verification online through the app to wherever you're going to check if you are safe to be there both to yourself and others. It provides a more organized and safer way to open up the country and European countries as well and yes they have been approved by the European Union on this. Anyways I think this can allow countries to  open up in a safer way then the first time they tried. This would help both the economy and stock market. This will all go down on August 6th at 3 pm (EDT) when they announce the application and the media is to announce it at that time as well.\n \nWho are these companies TransUnion is teaming up with?\n\nTransUnion- TransUnion is a global information and insights company that makes trust possible between businesses and consumers, by ensuring that each consumer is reliably and safely represented in the marketplace.

TransUnion, SiriusIQ and UST Global are partnering up to make a joint venture company called CLX Health LLC. CLX Health LLC is introducing an app called Healthy America\u2122\ufe0f  that is set to be announced on August 6th to the world. The media will be disclosing it at 3pm EDT on August 6th. \n\nWhat does it even do?\nThis link provides all the information you need without having to read all of that down there:\nhttps://solutions.transunion.com/healthy-america/resources/file/healthy-america-project-plan-2020.pdf\n    \nMessage from TransUnion on Healthy America:\n\nIn a world forever changed by the COVID-19 crisis, we\u2019re committed to protecting American lives. TransUnion and its US-based healthcare technology partners have developed HealthyAmericaTM. This unique solution enables people to securely share test results, helping businesses, schools and consumers assess risks stemming from COVID-19 and interact in a safe, confident manner.\nHealthyAmerica combines the power of TransUnion\u2019s identity and fraud solutions, clinical data management capabilities of SiriusIQ, and business transformation assets of UST Global \u2014 together forming CLX Health, LLC. By leveraging and deploying our existing technology in a way consumers and businesses can readily adopt, it will be easier to mitigate risk in everyday interactions while maintaining individual privacy. Going forward, we expect airlines, large event organizers, restaurants and others will leverage the tool \u2014 which will easily adapt to changes in science parameters, including the evolution of a seasonal vaccine.\n(https://solutions.transunion.com/healthy-america/?=undefined)\n\nWhat Healthy America is:\n\nCLX Health LLC, a joint venture company, has developed the HealthyAmericaTM mobile application to be deployed as a key component of the HealthyAmericaTM Solution Architecture and Database. The CLX Consortium of partner companies have come together to manage the spread of COVID-19 and other viruses by accessing real-time laboratory testing data for operational business and consumer decision support, ultimately allowing the economy to scale back up to capacity.\nUtilizing existing technology and infrastructure critical to delivering a solution now, the CLX Consortium has network access to over 1 million physician offices, 22 largest by volume clinical laboratories, 40 major hospital systems and 20 Federally Qualified Health Clinics (FQHC) in the United States.\nIn much the same way TSA PreCheckTM provided airline passengers with an increased level of confidence after 9/11, the HealthyAmerica application is positioned to mitigate risk of businesses and individuals. With TSA PreCheck in place, passengers returned to travel with assurance that fellow travelers had been screened and posed little to no risk. The HealthyAmerica application manages real-time and batch files of health status requests for consumers to provide businesses and facilities operational decision-making capabilities that can mitigate exposure to employees and clients.\nLike the TSA PreCheck status, which is delivered in bulk to airlines and directly to the consumer via a Quick Response (QR) code, HealthyAmerica enables consumers to present a QR code indicating health status. With the HealthyAmerica QR code, individuals can securely gain access to government-restricted sites, such as airports and/or sporting events, as examples.\nThe HealthyAmerica application works in the following manner, first requiring the individual consumer to register. Consumer identity is verified in combination with mobile device authentication, then the consumer selects a laboratory, schedules testing and receives validated test results\u2014all within the application on the consumer\u2019s verified device. The HealthyAmerica application stores diagnostic or antibodies test results received directly from an FDA-approved laboratory and generates a QR code indicating current health status.(https://www.siriusiq.com/siriusiq-introduces-clx-health-and-develops-healthyamerica-tm-as-virus-response-mobile-application/)\nMy summary and analysis:\n\nOkay so this app basically gives verification to other people on whether you have Covid-19 or not wherever you go. First you start off by scheduling a testing through the app for antibodies and then you send the tests to SiriusIQ labs where they see if you have antibodies. TransUnion then verifies your identity through your social security number making sure it\u2019s you. Then the data is stored in the app which is federally regulated and presents proof of your safety from Covid-19. You can also opt in or not for contact tracing on it to see who is infected and not. I think businesses, airports and big events like baseball games will soon require this because it\u2018s as simple as scanning a QR code or sending a verification online through the app to wherever you're going to check if you are safe to be there both to yourself and others.

Could Be the Come Behind Winner**\n* **An Effective Combo of Being in the Right Place, at the Right Time, With the Right People Has Red White &amp; Bloom Set to Change the Cannabis Game in the United States**\n\n In the American cannabis market, Illinois made the most sense for investors due to its upside potential and large user base. While not discounting this incredible opportunity, serious cannabis investors should also be looking at Michigan, which is an underdog with a potentially massive pathway to profitability. \n\n One lesser-known entity is about to conceivably bust open the vast riches of Michigan\u2019s cannabis market, an arena that Michigan State University predicts will mature into a $3 billion industry over the next few years. This is an organization that understands the importance of walking the less-beaten path to maximize growth and stakeholder returns \n\n Among the available prospects in the financial markets today, very few have the allure and tantalizing potential of the legal marijuana industry. When all is said and done, we\u2019re talking about a once illegal enterprise becoming a fully legal (and therefore taxable) industry. With fiscal budgets now a huge, perhaps crippling concern across international governing bodies, legalizing cannabis has economic appeal. \n\n At the same time, several cannabis stocks have been among the most disappointing for embattled stakeholders. Frankly, many hard-hit organizations simply grew too fast and irresponsibly. As well, unforeseen administrative issues, particularly in the Canadian cannabis space, have resulted in a sharp crash back toward reality. \n\n In 2020, U.S. Pot Stocks are finally being rewarded for their much stronger fundamentals compared to their Canadian counterparts, and as a result, have rebounded sharply and appear to be in the very early stages of a brand new cannabis bull market run. \n\n To summarize the key headwinds impacting the early volley of the cannabis investment market (i.e. initial legalization and \u201cCannabis 2.0\u201d), sector players have been hurt by these three obstacles: \n\n \n\n* Less-than-favourable geographic markets\n* Poor corporate planning/execution\n* Unfortunate geopolitical timing\n\n Let\u2019s tackle these three issues one-by-one, juxtaposing earlier setbacks against the potential profitability of Michigan\u2019s legal marijuana market and a rapidly rising upstart in the cannabis space. \n\n **Opportunity Calling in the Great Lakes State** \n\n As you know, Canada generated much fanfare when it became the first G7 member nation to legalize recreational marijuana. Immediately, investor dollars poured \u2013 almost indiscriminately \u2013 into any and all \u201cweedpreneurs.\u201d Unfortunately, the Canadian government could not handle the deluge of applications for dispensaries and other cannabis-related enterprises \n\n Invariably, one of the consequences of this dynamic was that applications were granted haphazardly without consideration to maximum efficiency \u2013 we are talking about the government, after all. Thus, many high-profile Canadian markets often received low cannabis retailer density on a per-capita basis. \n\n Simultaneously, several cannabis firms poured resources into production facilities whose end goods would have difficulty finding a home. Despite the obstacles, though, industry analysts project Canada\u2019s 2020 medical marijuana sales to [hit $1.513 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/587568/estimated-medical-marijuana-market-size-canada/) (2.03 billion CAD). And by 2022, the country may experience a peak in medical marijuana sales of $1.774 billion (2.38 billion CAD). \n\n Now, let\u2019s take a look at Michigan. Though overshadowed in the media by other marijuana-friendly regions like California, the Great Lakes State is quite a green powerhouse. As a report from [24/7 Wall Street](https://247wallst.com/) and published by [Huff Post](https://www.huffpost.com/news/us-news) reveals, Michigan had over [1.3 million marijuana](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/12-states-smoking-the-most-marijuana_b_577e900be4b03288ddc58433) users in 2016.

However, the tenacious management team at Red White &amp; Bloom have already grown revenues to $100 million during the most challenging period in the marijuana industry. Plus, by cementing a foothold in Michigan\u2019s broader retail machinery, RWB is well prepared to address any competitive concerns. \n\n **Massive Cannabis Catalyst on the Horizon** \n\n Undeniably, 2020 will forever be marked by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Pre-pandemic, public opinion polls favoured Trump, mostly because he ran on a strong economy. At the time, the headline numbers, such as Wall Street valuations and multi-year low unemployment, supported this narrative. \n\n However, the coronavirus ruined everything. And as the pandemic crushed several states, the probability of success for a second term diminished substantially. But as the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-may-give-trump-an-edge-11595373340) points out, [President Trump](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Trump/) could corral this crisis into a political catalyst. The [WSJ notes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-may-give-trump-an-edge-11595373340) that Trump supporters \u201care more enthusiastic than Biden\u2019s, and may be less fearful of going to the polls.\u201d \n\n Still, mere pandering alone may not be enough. Frankly, the economy is at an inflection point. Strong leadership and a chips-on-the-table approach to saving the country may prevent an apocalyptic disaster. Additionally, astute political strategists will observe that marijuana is also at an inflection point. All it takes is one major piece of legislation to move the momentum forward. \n\n Clearly, this is a win-win partnership. Although speculative, the COVID-19 pandemic may be the pivotal tailwind for which cannabis investors have been seeking. \n\n As Michigan State reported, it\u2019s not just the $3 billion annual revenue stream that should interest prospective investors of RWB stock. Instead, it\u2019s the 13,500 jobs that the green industry will create. Plus, the tax revenue from the projected sales should amount to nearly half-a-billion dollars annually for the state government. \n\n In a single strike, both state and federal authorities could open an unnecessarily capped economic engine. And that\u2019s precisely what the U.S. needs \u2013 jobs and robust tax revenue streams. \n\n To that end, investors should consider the broader bullish case for RWB stock. In addition to the incredible production footprint that Red White &amp; Bloom leverages, RWB is set to [acquire 100% of the incredibly successful American cannabis company, Platinum Vape](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/red-white-bloom-to-acquire-premium-cannabis-brand-with-over-70-million-in-annualized-revenue/). A specialist in vaping and cannabis-infused products such as edibles, [Platinum Vape](https://houseofplatinum.com/) products are sold at over 700 retail locations throughout the U.S. \n\n In particular, this acquisition will bring revenue streams from [California](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/California/) and [Oklahoma](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Oklahoma/) under the Red White &amp; Bloom umbrella. The former has always been a vaping stronghold, and the practice has exploded in popularity in the latter. \n\n In addition to the Platinum Vape deal, just last week, Red White &amp; Bloom announced that the company [exercised its call option to acquire 100% of the Michigan-based cannabis company PharmaCo](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/red-white-bloom-exercises-call-option-to-acquire-100-of-michigan-based-pharmaco/). \n\n \u201cPharmaCo has established significant market share within the state of Michigan. Now that we have completed our go public transaction, we felt that the time was right for us to take the next step of rolling our critical mass asset base together in what we believe is one of the top 3 most important cannabis states by market size and potential,\u201d [said RWB CEO Brad Rogers](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/red-white-bloom-exercises-call-option-to-acquire-100-of-michigan-based-pharmaco/). \n\n Best of all, in mid-June, RWB closed a [game-changing exclusive licensing agreement with High Times](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/red-white-bloom-closes-landmark-high-times-deal/). Inarguably the vanguard of cannabis pop culture, [High Times](https://hightimes.com/) enjoys millions of monthly page views, as well as 8.9 million social media followers. The deal cements the RWB brand to the single-largest consumer portal possible, facilitating a daunting firewall against would-be competitors. \n\n **Putting It All Together** \n\n Notwithstanding the incredible potential of RWB stock, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Red White &amp; Bloom is how [deeply undervalued it is](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/this-u-s-cannabis-stock-appears-to-be-way-undervalued-and-may-actually-benefit-from-a-second-wave-of-the-pandemic/). In a way, this shouldn\u2019t be too surprising. As we discussed at the top, many investors were burnt when the [Canadian cannabis bubble burst in late 2018](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/cannabis-boom-2-0-heres-why-some-pot-stocks-are-soaring-like-we-havent-seen-since-2018/). It\u2019s understandable that some investors may be a little gun shy when it comes to cannabis stocks for this reason, but the massive American market, which is yet to fully open up and is full of huge potential catalysts, is a whole new ball game. \n\n As mentioned, U.S. pot stocks have begun to take off and many experts are calling this move the beginning of a [new bull market in marijuana or simply, the Cannabis Boom 2.0](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/cannabis-boom-2-0-heres-why-some-pot-stocks-are-soaring-like-we-havent-seen-since-2018/). Top U.S. MSOs such as [Curaleaf (CSE: CURA) (OTCQX: CURLF)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Curaleaf), [Trulieve (CSE: TRUL) (OTCQX: TCNNF)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Trulieve) and [Green Thumb (CSE: GTII) (OTCQX: GTBIF) (FRA: R9U2)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/GTII/) are finally getting the love they deserve as a result of strong earnings and it won\u2019t be long until RWB is right up there with them \n\n The Red White &amp; Bloom story is very compelling and it becomes clearer when you stack the underlying company up against leading Canadian cannabis firms. With an assumed share price of $1.25, Red White &amp; Bloom has an enterprise value of $375 million. \n\n From an [EV/EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ev-ebitda.asp) calculation, RWB has a ratio of 6.5. That is half the valuation of many leading Canadian cannabis firms\u2019 valuation. However, if we ramp up the EV/EBITDA ratio to 19.2 \u2013 the median ratio of select Canadian competitors \u2013 the implied enterprise value will hit slightly over $1.1 billion. And this will translate to a stock price of $4.58. \n\n Even more enticing, it\u2019s possible RWB\u2019s valuation could exceed projections. While cannabis is capturing new adherents, the vanguards of the adult liberties markets \u2013 alcohol, tobacco and big pharmaceuticals \u2013 are losing market share. To stay relevant in this new age, the top players may end up opening their wallets and partnering with strong, sustainable cannabis firms. \n\n Indeed, we\u2019ve already seen this happen with [Canopy Growth (TSX: WEED) (NYSE: CGC) (FRA: 11L1)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Canopy-Growth/) and [Cronos Group (TSX: CRON) (NASDAQ: CRON) (FRA: 7CI)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Cronos-Group/), which secured partnerships with alcoholic beverage maker [Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ) (FRA: CB1A)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Constellation-Brands/) and tobacco giant [Altria Group (NYSE: MO) (FRA: PHM7)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Altria/), respectively. Though nothing is set in stone, there\u2019s no reason to believe such major deals won\u2019t happen again, but this time, with top U.S. cannabis names. \n\n When you factor in Red White &amp; Bloom\u2019s dominance in Michigan\u2019s burgeoning cannabis market, along with expanding its MSO footprint in key regions, RWB is well-positioned for any breakthroughs in the legal environment.

While not discounting this incredible opportunity, serious cannabis investors should also be looking at Michigan, which is an underdog with a potentially massive pathway to profitability. \n\n One lesser-known entity is about to conceivably bust open the vast riches of Michigan\u2019s cannabis market, an arena that Michigan State University predicts will mature into a $3 billion industry over the next few years. This is an organization that understands the importance of walking the less-beaten path to maximize growth and stakeholder returns \n\n Among the available prospects in the financial markets today, very few have the allure and tantalizing potential of the legal marijuana industry. When all is said and done, we\u2019re talking about a once illegal enterprise becoming a fully legal (and therefore taxable) industry. With fiscal budgets now a huge, perhaps crippling concern across international governing bodies, legalizing cannabis has economic appeal. \n\n At the same time, several cannabis stocks have been among the most disappointing for embattled stakeholders. Frankly, many hard-hit organizations simply grew too fast and irresponsibly. As well, unforeseen administrative issues, particularly in the Canadian cannabis space, have resulted in a sharp crash back toward reality. \n\n In 2020, U.S. Pot Stocks are finally being rewarded for their much stronger fundamentals compared to their Canadian counterparts, and as a result, have rebounded sharply and appear to be in the very early stages of a brand new cannabis bull market run. \n\n To summarize the key headwinds impacting the early volley of the cannabis investment market (i.e. initial legalization and \u201cCannabis 2.0\u201d), sector players have been hurt by these three obstacles: \n\n \n\n* Less-than-favourable geographic markets\n* Poor corporate planning/execution\n* Unfortunate geopolitical timing\n\n Let\u2019s tackle these three issues one-by-one, juxtaposing earlier setbacks against the potential profitability of Michigan\u2019s legal marijuana market and a rapidly rising upstart in the cannabis space. \n\n **Opportunity Calling in the Great Lakes State** \n\n As you know, Canada generated much fanfare when it became the first G7 member nation to legalize recreational marijuana. Immediately, investor dollars poured \u2013 almost indiscriminately \u2013 into any and all \u201cweedpreneurs.\u201d Unfortunately, the Canadian government could not handle the deluge of applications for dispensaries and other cannabis-related enterprises \n\n Invariably, one of the consequences of this dynamic was that applications were granted haphazardly without consideration to maximum efficiency \u2013 we are talking about the government, after all. Thus, many high-profile Canadian markets often received low cannabis retailer density on a per-capita basis. \n\n Simultaneously, several cannabis firms poured resources into production facilities whose end goods would have difficulty finding a home. Despite the obstacles, though, industry analysts project Canada\u2019s 2020 medical marijuana sales to [hit $1.513 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/587568/estimated-medical-marijuana-market-size-canada/) (2.03 billion CAD). And by 2022, the country may experience a peak in medical marijuana sales of $1.774 billion (2.38 billion CAD). \n\n Now, let\u2019s take a look at Michigan. Though overshadowed in the media by other marijuana-friendly regions like California, the Great Lakes State is quite a green powerhouse. As a report from [24/7 Wall Street](https://247wallst.com/) and published by [Huff Post](https://www.huffpost.com/news/us-news) reveals, Michigan had over [1.3 million marijuana](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/12-states-smoking-the-most-marijuana_b_577e900be4b03288ddc58433) users in 2016. Because of its smaller nominal population size, however, it has a higher per-capita density of weed users (15.6%), than stalwart California at 14.9%. \n\n But even on a nominal basis, Michigan is home to the sixth-largest cannabis consumer market. According to the state\u2019s [Marijuana Regulatory Agency](https://www.michigan.gov/mra/), by September of this year, Michigan\u2019s cannabis industry will generate [$390 million in recreational sales](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2019/12/michigans-recreational-marijuana-industry-poised-to-grow-exponentially-in-2020.html). By the end of 2021, the recreational market will explode to nearly $1.5 billion. \n\n Such projections are begging a well-run organization to establish dominance in this ripe-for-the-picking and undervalued market. And that company could very well be [**Red White &amp; Bloom (CSE: RWB) (OTCQX: RWBYF)**](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Red-White-And-Bloom/). \n\n **RWB is a Firecracker of an Upstart** \n\n Unlike other cannabis firms that have been plagued by poor planning and myopic leadership, Red White &amp; Bloom focuses on prudent, responsible growth.

Although speculative, the COVID-19 pandemic may be the pivotal tailwind for which cannabis investors have been seeking. \n\n As Michigan State reported, it\u2019s not just the $3 billion annual revenue stream that should interest prospective investors of RWB stock. Instead, it\u2019s the 13,500 jobs that the green industry will create. Plus, the tax revenue from the projected sales should amount to nearly half-a-billion dollars annually for the state government. \n\n In a single strike, both state and federal authorities could open an unnecessarily capped economic engine. And that\u2019s precisely what the U.S. needs \u2013 jobs and robust tax revenue streams. \n\n To that end, investors should consider the broader bullish case for RWB stock. In addition to the incredible production footprint that Red White &amp; Bloom leverages, RWB is set to [acquire 100% of the incredibly successful American cannabis company, Platinum Vape](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/red-white-bloom-to-acquire-premium-cannabis-brand-with-over-70-million-in-annualized-revenue/). A specialist in vaping and cannabis-infused products such as edibles, [Platinum Vape](https://houseofplatinum.com/) products are sold at over 700 retail locations throughout the U.S. \n\n In particular, this acquisition will bring revenue streams from [California](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/California/) and [Oklahoma](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Oklahoma/) under the Red White &amp; Bloom umbrella. The former has always been a vaping stronghold, and the practice has exploded in popularity in the latter. \n\n In addition to the Platinum Vape deal, just last week, Red White &amp; Bloom announced that the company [exercised its call option to acquire 100% of the Michigan-based cannabis company PharmaCo](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/red-white-bloom-exercises-call-option-to-acquire-100-of-michigan-based-pharmaco/). \n\n \u201cPharmaCo has established significant market share within the state of Michigan. Now that we have completed our go public transaction, we felt that the time was right for us to take the next step of rolling our critical mass asset base together in what we believe is one of the top 3 most important cannabis states by market size and potential,\u201d [said RWB CEO Brad Rogers](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/red-white-bloom-exercises-call-option-to-acquire-100-of-michigan-based-pharmaco/). \n\n Best of all, in mid-June, RWB closed a [game-changing exclusive licensing agreement with High Times](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/red-white-bloom-closes-landmark-high-times-deal/). Inarguably the vanguard of cannabis pop culture, [High Times](https://hightimes.com/) enjoys millions of monthly page views, as well as 8.9 million social media followers. The deal cements the RWB brand to the single-largest consumer portal possible, facilitating a daunting firewall against would-be competitors. \n\n **Putting It All Together** \n\n Notwithstanding the incredible potential of RWB stock, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Red White &amp; Bloom is how [deeply undervalued it is](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/this-u-s-cannabis-stock-appears-to-be-way-undervalued-and-may-actually-benefit-from-a-second-wave-of-the-pandemic/). In a way, this shouldn\u2019t be too surprising. As we discussed at the top, many investors were burnt when the [Canadian cannabis bubble burst in late 2018](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/cannabis-boom-2-0-heres-why-some-pot-stocks-are-soaring-like-we-havent-seen-since-2018/). It\u2019s understandable that some investors may be a little gun shy when it comes to cannabis stocks for this reason, but the massive American market, which is yet to fully open up and is full of huge potential catalysts, is a whole new ball game. \n\n As mentioned, U.S. pot stocks have begun to take off and many experts are calling this move the beginning of a [new bull market in marijuana or simply, the Cannabis Boom 2.0](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/cannabis-boom-2-0-heres-why-some-pot-stocks-are-soaring-like-we-havent-seen-since-2018/). Top U.S. MSOs such as [Curaleaf (CSE: CURA) (OTCQX: CURLF)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Curaleaf), [Trulieve (CSE: TRUL) (OTCQX: TCNNF)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Trulieve) and [Green Thumb (CSE: GTII) (OTCQX: GTBIF) (FRA: R9U2)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/GTII/) are finally getting the love they deserve as a result of strong earnings and it won\u2019t be long until RWB is right up there with them \n\n The Red White &amp; Bloom story is very compelling and it becomes clearer when you stack the underlying company up against leading Canadian cannabis firms. With an assumed share price of $1.25, Red White &amp; Bloom has an enterprise value of $375 million. \n\n From an [EV/EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ev-ebitda.asp) calculation, RWB has a ratio of 6.5. That is half the valuation of many leading Canadian cannabis firms\u2019 valuation. However, if we ramp up the EV/EBITDA ratio to 19.2 \u2013 the median ratio of select Canadian competitors \u2013 the implied enterprise value will hit slightly over $1.1 billion. And this will translate to a stock price of $4.58. \n\n Even more enticing, it\u2019s possible RWB\u2019s valuation could exceed projections. While cannabis is capturing new adherents, the vanguards of the adult liberties markets \u2013 alcohol, tobacco and big pharmaceuticals \u2013 are losing market share. To stay relevant in this new age, the top players may end up opening their wallets and partnering with strong, sustainable cannabis firms. \n\n Indeed, we\u2019ve already seen this happen with [Canopy Growth (TSX: WEED) (NYSE: CGC) (FRA: 11L1)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Canopy-Growth/) and [Cronos Group (TSX: CRON) (NASDAQ: CRON) (FRA: 7CI)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Cronos-Group/), which secured partnerships with alcoholic beverage maker [Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ) (FRA: CB1A)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Constellation-Brands/) and tobacco giant [Altria Group (NYSE: MO) (FRA: PHM7)](https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/tag/Altria/), respectively. Though nothing is set in stone, there\u2019s no reason to believe such major deals won\u2019t happen again, but this time, with top U.S. cannabis names. \n\n When you factor in Red White &amp; Bloom\u2019s dominance in Michigan\u2019s burgeoning cannabis market, along with expanding its MSO footprint in key regions, RWB is well-positioned for any breakthroughs in the legal environment. But the most potent opportunity could be now when the crowd has yet to sniff out this budding firecracker.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 774841, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "$RWB $RWBYF U.S. Pot Stocks Are Heating Up and This Lesser-Known Cannabis Name Looks Poised to Catapult to the Top", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i2p3sk/rwb_rwbyf_us_pot_stocks_are_heating_up_and_this/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1596418786.0}], [[], false, "TerryBerry123", null, [], null, "text", "t2_frrxibw", false, false, [], false, false, 1596299797, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i1v49s/i_own_paper_shares_of_a_stock_that_was_acquired/", {}, "i1v49s", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "advicerequest", [], "75a227ec-65e6-11e5-96ee-12d48f46797b", "Advice Request", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 14, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/i1v49s/i_own_paper_shares_of_a_stock_that_was_acquired/", false, 6, 1596299808, 1, "Hey everyone. \n\n- I own paper shares in a company I use to work for\n- this company was acquired by a private company in October 2019\n- charts show a last trading day of March 2,2020\n- the company has all of my current mailing information \n- I was not notified as a shareholder at the time of the acquisition \n- I have not heard back from the HR team at the company that was acquired \n\nQuestion : how can I get the money for my shares ?", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 772927, "public", "self", "I Own paper shares of a stock that was acquired by a private company in October 2019.

Back then, AMD found itself completely out-maneuvered by Intel in the desktop, laptop, and sever markets and had largely been shut out of both smartphone and tablet production.\n\nThis fascinating story features some matchmaking by Bill Gates, a failed attempt by AMD to acquire Nvidia when it traded under $15 a share, and a botched integration with graphics maker ATI Technologies. Warning: the two-part article, while super interesting, is absolutely on the lengthy side. For those of you who like the quick-hitters, I've summarized the highlights below.\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/the-rise-and-fall-of-amd-how-an-underdog-stuck-it-to-intel/](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/the-rise-and-fall-of-amd-how-an-underdog-stuck-it-to-intel/)\n\n* During the 1980s, AMD was a second-source supplier for companies using Intel processors. Companies like IBM didn't want to rely solely on Intel for one of the primary components in their computers, so they licensed AMD to produce versions of Intel processors. However in 1985, Intel stopped giving AMD its designs which forced them to reverse-engineer versions of Intel parts. By 1990, Merrill Lynch had declared AMD \"dead\", as the smaller company couldn't keep up with Intel product releases. This would not be the last time, as its aggressive pricing throughout the first half of the 90s had left AMD in a poor financial position. \n* In 1994, a tiny Silicon Valley outfit named NexGen began shipping a chip that was comparable to Intel's flagship Pentium. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates had taken an interest in NexGen, in particular, its brilliant CEO, Atiq Raza. Gates suggested that Raza speak to AMD since the company owned a chip fab but needed a better product to build in it. Raza met with then-CEO Jerry Sanders, who threatened to run NexGen out of business. Upon hearing about the exchange, Gates picked up the phone, called Sanders, and convinced AMD to purchase NexGen for $615mn in 1995. Soon after, Raza, dubbed by Sanders as the \"Michael Jordan of microprocessor design\", helped AMD develop the K6 - a major turning point for the company.\n* The K6 rivaled Intel on speed and price, and its revisions led to one of AMD's most successful architectures: K7, marketed as the Athlon. Athlon received \"CPU of the Year\" in 1999 from ArsTechnica and helped AMD grow sales from $2.5bn in 1998 to $4.6bn by 2000. With the company having just pulled in nearly $1bn in profits, Sanders rented out San Jose's entire HP Pavilion (now the SAP Center) for a party in which he paid for Tim McGraw and Faith Hill to perform and proclaimed AMD's share price would soon hit $100.\n* Around this time the company started spending too much and spreading itself too thin. AMD was making most of its profit from memory, but was also dabbling in logic, microprocessors, and communication products. Sanders had also decided to build a massive fab in Germany with borrowed money. Despite this, AMD continued to find technical success. AMD utilized the Athlon to develop a similar architecture that was more useful for severs. The new product, Opteron, led to AMD capturing an estimated 25% of the server market by 2006 all the while Intel struggled to produce a chip that could compete with the performance advantages of Opteron.\n* While on the surface AMD seemed to be firing on all cylinders with its popular Athlon and Opteron chips, the company was a financial mess behind-the-scenes. The company announced net losses of $61mn in 2001, $1.3bn in 2002, and $274mn in 2003. The main culprit? Investments in fabs that grossly overshot initial cost estimates. Between its two locations in Germany, AMD invested roughly $4.6bn.\n* AMD's competitive edge with Opteron coincided with some low points for Intel that forced the company to re-imagine its architecture altogether. The result was the release of the Intel Core microarchitecture in 2006. Core enabled Intel to take back the performance crown in the PC market, and it proved more power-efficient than AMD's laptop chips right when laptops began to outsell desktops for the first time.  Intel compounded the pain by strategically releasing frequent upgrades and forcing AMD to play catch-up yet again. \n* Though AMD's CPUs consistently improved, over time they became shut out of the high-end market once more and were relegated to compete mainly on price, mirroring the company's early struggles. As Intel churned out its best product in years, AMD began trying to swallow another company whole. In 2006, AMD saw an opportunity for the future by integrating a memory controller into the CPU. However, the company needed the graphics and chipset experience to make it happen.\n* The solution was to purchase Canadian graphics company ATI Technologies for $5.4bn - or roughly half of AMD's market cap. This came after AMD had approached Nvidia as its first-choice takeover target. At that time, Nvidia was trading under $15 a share. But Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia's outspoken CEO, insisted on running the combined company \u2014 a non-starter for AMD leadership. While ATI's technology was considered superior to Intel's, the integration process proved disastrous from the start. Employees from the two companies divided into green (AMD and CPU) and red (ATI and GPU) sides, prioritizing needs of their individual products, and causing major delays time and time again. \n* With problems executing and stagnant sales, AMD ended 2007 with more than $5bn in debt and lost $3.3bn on the year after having taken a write-down charge for its acquisition of ATI. The company was having serious difficulty affording the costs of its fab facilities, when the entire industry endured a sharp downturn in 2008 that caused the stock to plummet from $20 to $4 a share. \n* AMD had no choice but to spin off its foundries in 2009 (AMD spun off GlobalFoundries in 2009), weakening its competitive positioning relative to Intel. Despite efforts to engineer higher quality products, its share of the PC and sever businesses kept declining and AMD was unable to achieve meaningful share in the ultrabook and tablet segments. The low-end CPU market sent margins tumbling and increased exposure to secular declines in PC sales. \n* By 2013, only one singular analyst on Wall Street was bullish on the stock \u2014 which had now fallen from $8 at the start of 2012 to just around $2. Yet after a major delay with the highly anticipated \"Fusion\" 32nm chip, the analyst noted that there were now liquidity concerns due to the declining PC market.

Back then, AMD found itself completely out-maneuvered by Intel in the desktop, laptop, and sever markets and had largely been shut out of both smartphone and tablet production.\n\nThis fascinating story features some matchmaking by Bill Gates, a failed attempt by AMD to acquire Nvidia when it traded under $15 a share, and a botched integration with graphics maker ATI Technologies. Warning: the two-part article, while super interesting, is absolutely on the lengthy side. For those of you who like the quick-hitters, I've summarized the highlights below.\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/the-rise-and-fall-of-amd-how-an-underdog-stuck-it-to-intel/](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/the-rise-and-fall-of-amd-how-an-underdog-stuck-it-to-intel/)\n\n* During the 1980s, AMD was a second-source supplier for companies using Intel processors. Companies like IBM didn't want to rely solely on Intel for one of the primary components in their computers, so they licensed AMD to produce versions of Intel processors. However in 1985, Intel stopped giving AMD its designs which forced them to reverse-engineer versions of Intel parts. By 1990, Merrill Lynch had declared AMD \"dead\", as the smaller company couldn't keep up with Intel product releases. This would not be the last time, as its aggressive pricing throughout the first half of the 90s had left AMD in a poor financial position. \n* In 1994, a tiny Silicon Valley outfit named NexGen began shipping a chip that was comparable to Intel's flagship Pentium. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates had taken an interest in NexGen, in particular, its brilliant CEO, Atiq Raza. Gates suggested that Raza speak to AMD since the company owned a chip fab but needed a better product to build in it. Raza met with then-CEO Jerry Sanders, who threatened to run NexGen out of business. Upon hearing about the exchange, Gates picked up the phone, called Sanders, and convinced AMD to purchase NexGen for $615mn in 1995. Soon after, Raza, dubbed by Sanders as the \"Michael Jordan of microprocessor design\", helped AMD develop the K6 - a major turning point for the company.\n* The K6 rivaled Intel on speed and price, and its revisions led to one of AMD's most successful architectures: K7, marketed as the Athlon. Athlon received \"CPU of the Year\" in 1999 from ArsTechnica and helped AMD grow sales from $2.5bn in 1998 to $4.6bn by 2000. With the company having just pulled in nearly $1bn in profits, Sanders rented out San Jose's entire HP Pavilion (now the SAP Center) for a party in which he paid for Tim McGraw and Faith Hill to perform and proclaimed AMD's share price would soon hit $100.\n* Around this time the company started spending too much and spreading itself too thin. AMD was making most of its profit from memory, but was also dabbling in logic, microprocessors, and communication products. Sanders had also decided to build a massive fab in Germany with borrowed money. Despite this, AMD continued to find technical success. AMD utilized the Athlon to develop a similar architecture that was more useful for severs. The new product, Opteron, led to AMD capturing an estimated 25% of the server market by 2006 all the while Intel struggled to produce a chip that could compete with the performance advantages of Opteron.\n* While on the surface AMD seemed to be firing on all cylinders with its popular Athlon and Opteron chips, the company was a financial mess behind-the-scenes. The company announced net losses of $61mn in 2001, $1.3bn in 2002, and $274mn in 2003. The main culprit? Investments in fabs that grossly overshot initial cost estimates. Between its two locations in Germany, AMD invested roughly $4.6bn.\n* AMD's competitive edge with Opteron coincided with some low points for Intel that forced the company to re-imagine its architecture altogether. The result was the release of the Intel Core microarchitecture in 2006. Core enabled Intel to take back the performance crown in the PC market, and it proved more power-efficient than AMD's laptop chips right when laptops began to outsell desktops for the first time.  Intel compounded the pain by strategically releasing frequent upgrades and forcing AMD to play catch-up yet again. \n* Though AMD's CPUs consistently improved, over time they became shut out of the high-end market once more and were relegated to compete mainly on price, mirroring the company's early struggles. As Intel churned out its best product in years, AMD began trying to swallow another company whole. In 2006, AMD saw an opportunity for the future by integrating a memory controller into the CPU. However, the company needed the graphics and chipset experience to make it happen.\n* The solution was to purchase Canadian graphics company ATI Technologies for $5.4bn - or roughly half of AMD's market cap. This came after AMD had approached Nvidia as its first-choice takeover target. At that time, Nvidia was trading under $15 a share. But Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia's outspoken CEO, insisted on running the combined company \u2014 a non-starter for AMD leadership. While ATI's technology was considered superior to Intel's, the integration process proved disastrous from the start. Employees from the two companies divided into green (AMD and CPU) and red (ATI and GPU) sides, prioritizing needs of their individual products, and causing major delays time and time again. \n* With problems executing and stagnant sales, AMD ended 2007 with more than $5bn in debt and lost $3.3bn on the year after having taken a write-down charge for its acquisition of ATI. The company was having serious difficulty affording the costs of its fab facilities, when the entire industry endured a sharp downturn in 2008 that caused the stock to plummet from $20 to $4 a share. \n* AMD had no choice but to spin off its foundries in 2009 (AMD spun off GlobalFoundries in 2009), weakening its competitive positioning relative to Intel. Despite efforts to engineer higher quality products, its share of the PC and sever businesses kept declining and AMD was unable to achieve meaningful share in the ultrabook and tablet segments. The low-end CPU market sent margins tumbling and increased exposure to secular declines in PC sales. \n* By 2013, only one singular analyst on Wall Street was bullish on the stock \u2014 which had now fallen from $8 at the start of 2012 to just around $2. Yet after a major delay with the highly anticipated \"Fusion\" 32nm chip, the analyst noted that there were now liquidity concerns due to the declining PC market. Even former CFO Fran Barton thought AMD had next to no future in its battle with Intel: \"***...the game's been played.***\"\n\nFlash-forward to today and AMD just delivered its highest CPU revenue in over 12 years, has taken CPU market share for 11 straight quarters, and currently enjoys double-digit server processor market share.

I'm generally bullish but am interested in people's thoughts as well. Let me know\n\n\\------\n\nAccolade Inc ($ACCD)\n\nIPO July 2020: [https://www.geekwire.com/2020/accolade-ceo-raj-singh-health-tech-companys-ipo-path-profits-pandemics-second-hit/](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/accolade-ceo-raj-singh-health-tech-companys-ipo-path-profits-pandemics-second-hit/)\n\n**Business Model:**\n\nACC plays in the healthcare industry. Their target customers are employers that are interested in helping their employees manage benefits through the employee insurance. What do they do exactly? Two things: Technology + Service. But let\u2019s look at the business model in example:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccolade currently only has 60 customers, they have some big ones (Comcast, Intuit, American Airlines)\n\n\\- AA sets up with Accolade to manage their employee benefits\n\n\\- ACCD already has a partner ecosystem with various payers (Cigna, united, etc.)\n\n\\- AA employees will still choose their desired insurance plan based on their needs during Open Enrollment (US-only)\n\n\\- Throughout the year, employee John needs to see a doctor/specialist but is unsure of what to do, where to go, or how much it will cost\n\n\\- Because AA has Accolade, John is able to connect with a health advocate at ACCD to directly ask for help on what he should do\n\n\\- ACCD with their data analytics and network helps John and advises on who to go to\n\n\\- Once John is done, he also needs help with his claims to the insurance\n\n\\- ACCD once again, helps John along with filing the insurance claims\n\n\\- AA pays a per employee cost for their entire service contract\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Example ACCD benefits by customers:**\n\n\\- Intuit: [https://www.intuitbenefits.com/health-care/accolade-health-assistant](https://www.intuitbenefits.com/health-care/accolade-health-assistant)\n\n\\- American Airlines: [https://my.aa.com/accolade/](https://my.aa.com/accolade/)\n\n\\- Seattle City Gov\u2019t:[https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/HumanResources/Benefits/Accolade-FAQs.pdf](https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/HumanResources/Benefits/Accolade-FAQs.pdf) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Let\u2019s break down their market advantage-\n\n**Technology**:\n\n\\- Their competitive advantage is what they market, using data analytics to evaluate what is the best treatment, medication, and cost for a customer\u2019s employees when they need care. They also have various tech in place to support this business process: mobile app for customers to connect, portals directly for the employees to access ([https://login.myaccolade.com](https://login.myaccolade.com)), and integrated service facing tools.\n\n\\- They recently bought claims data company in 2019 ([https://www.inquirer.com/business/comcast-accolade-healthcare-digital-california-20190801.html](https://www.inquirer.com/business/comcast-accolade-healthcare-digital-california-20190801.html)). My guess is that they\u2019re using this to add to their analytics to provide better recommendations to employees on what doctors and benefits to use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Service**: \n\n\\- This one is simple, they hire health advocates and nurses, etc. as service reps on the other side of the line to respond to employees. These advocate reps are would review an employees benefits and provide the recommendations. \n\n\\- They also help the employees with filing any paperwork or additional claims processing. \n\n\\- Typically, a single customer account will have a designated service team that handles their employee benefits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Competitors**:\n\n\\- Collective Health is their main competitor ([https://collectivehealth.com/](https://collectivehealth.com/)). They also provide a benefit concierge service. Their target is on self funded insurance plans. Biggest customers are Zendesk, Palantir, Activision, etc. They have had \\~400mil in investor funding to date.\n\n\\- CastLight Health ($CSLT) plays in this similar space but only provide the technology backend. They do not provide or manage service in the way that ACCD and CH do. They have also fumbled poorly with the leadership and revenue, their stock has plummeted as a result. \n\n\\- It is worth noting that ACCD and CH do not compete with HRIS and Benefit Planning software (e.g. WDAY, ADP, Peoplesoft, etc). Those processes and tools remain as-is for target customers. It is my understanding that this health care service is focused on post-benefit enrollment and day-to-day needs of employees with their actual healthcare prescribers and practices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Financial Analysis:** \n\n\\- They are currently running a very high cost/loss with growing revenue. Trading at \\~7-8x revenue\n\n\\- They hire a lot on payroll for their services (\\~1500 employees). CH only has several hundred.\n\n\\- Growth risk and continuation is needed, AA and Comcast make up a significant portion of their revenue\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Personal Take:**\n\n\\- I favor their executive team, heavily. ACCD was founded in 2007 by Tom Spann. But the leadership was replaced by current CEO in 2015, who brought along his Concur co founders. He and his co founders sold concur off to SAP for billions back in 2014. Concur is big in the corporate world. If  Singh and his team can be strategic about this space and market, then I think we can see ACCD bag more customers and be a staple name in corporate health insurance. \n\n\\- The risks to this company - in survey data, \\~47% of individuals in the US get their insurance from their employer. ([https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/small-business/how-many-americans-get-health-insurance-from-their-employer](https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/small-business/how-many-americans-get-health-insurance-from-their-employer)) This means their growth is limited in size. Additionally, what about global? I have no idea how insurance plays globally and whether this has market fit.\n\n\\- IPO price action sold off on the first day. It seems while we see interest in tele health such as LVGO and TDOC, the market doesn\u2019t favor ACCD - possibly due to its weak financials. \n\n\\- Personally, I see this as a 50/50. There financial risk at this time but has high potential to succeed if their management is able to sell, execute, and change the industry in general.", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 756342, "public", "self", "ACCD DD - Accolade, new health tech disruptor or bust?", 0, [], 0.67, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hueydf/accd_dd_accolade_new_health_tech_disruptor_or_bust/", "all_ads", 6, 1595215980.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "genuisgeek", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1606u5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595219580, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hueydf/accd_dd_accolade_new_health_tech_disruptor_or_bust/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hueydf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "tickerdiscussion", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "612ee368-65e6-11e5-b53f-129e4297eb59", "link_flair_text": "Ticker Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/hueydf/accd_dd_accolade_new_health_tech_disruptor_or_bust/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "gvvf9l3CyG7EY46fbAiYH7xr-JGBigAtSZNwKEkuo9Y", "resolutions": [{"height": 61, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/DrxutMH0VzTOZXf9snRwTWV9CCXrtPs8n_8KllyFpW4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d1ddd29c7183a6a937d52a439f3fe29e3a9128a", "width": 108}, {"height": 122, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/DrxutMH0VzTOZXf9snRwTWV9CCXrtPs8n_8KllyFpW4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=269aa6bc0313b81eef189bb54623367968943284", "width": 216}, {"height": 181, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/DrxutMH0VzTOZXf9snRwTWV9CCXrtPs8n_8KllyFpW4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c8c5b24f1dfb503e7a449e748945c73b7f69e21", "width": 320}, {"height": 363, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/DrxutMH0VzTOZXf9snRwTWV9CCXrtPs8n_8KllyFpW4.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d063cf6af581ca882a6334fa08241f2e65d9a69", "width": 640}, {"height": 545, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/DrxutMH0VzTOZXf9snRwTWV9CCXrtPs8n_8KllyFpW4.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5492e9b82ddf96a9d1080051d564b9670ec0987", "width": 960}, {"height": 613, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/DrxutMH0VzTOZXf9snRwTWV9CCXrtPs8n_8KllyFpW4.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e856426f463229e5ad2b020189dc46cd27a04c2b", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 741, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/DrxutMH0VzTOZXf9snRwTWV9CCXrtPs8n_8KllyFpW4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b1c5a11bada50ab52cdae9cb3449f28ffb43d7a9", "width": 1305}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1595303827, "score": 2, "selftext": "this is my DD on Accolade that just IPO'd earlier this month.

He and his co founders sold concur off to SAP for billions back in 2014. Concur is big in the corporate world. If  Singh and his team can be strategic about this space and market, then I think we can see ACCD bag more customers and be a staple name in corporate health insurance. \n\n\\- The risks to this company - in survey data, \\~47% of individuals in the US get their insurance from their employer. ([https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/small-business/how-many-americans-get-health-insurance-from-their-employer](https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/small-business/how-many-americans-get-health-insurance-from-their-employer)) This means their growth is limited in size. Additionally, what about global? I have no idea how insurance plays globally and whether this has market fit.\n\n\\- IPO price action sold off on the first day. It seems while we see interest in tele health such as LVGO and TDOC, the market doesn\u2019t favor ACCD - possibly due to its weak financials. \n\n\\- Personally, I see this as a 50/50.

With this new announcement, Spirit is continuing to demonstrate why Kansas is the preeminent destination for business to grow and thrive.\u201d\n\nVirgin Hyperloop says the hyperloop is a new mode of transportation eliminating barriers of distance and time for both people and freight. The hyperloop can travel at speeds approaching 700 mph, which connects cities like metro stops, and has zero emissions.\n\nAccording to the groundbreaking company, pods accelerate gradually via electric propulsion through a low-pressure tube, then floats along a track using magnetic levitation and glides at airline speeds for long distances due to the low aerodynamic drag.\n\n\u201cAs one of the most credible aerospace-grade structures companies in the world, Spirit AeroSystems provides a strong fit for our team as we look to build out strong partners in the hyperloop ecosystem,\u201d says Josh Giegel, Chief Technology Officer of Virgin Hyperloop.\n\nThe company also says the supply chain is unique in the way existing technology is integrated with proprietary innovations to deliver a new transportation experience.

With this new announcement, Spirit is continuing to demonstrate why Kansas is the preeminent destination for business to grow and thrive.\u201d\n\nVirgin Hyperloop says the hyperloop is a new mode of transportation eliminating barriers of distance and time for both people and freight. The hyperloop can travel at speeds approaching 700 mph, which connects cities like metro stops, and has zero emissions.\n\nAccording to the groundbreaking company, pods accelerate gradually via electric propulsion through a low-pressure tube, then floats along a track using magnetic levitation and glides at airline speeds for long distances due to the low aerodynamic drag.\n\n\u201cAs one of the most credible aerospace-grade structures companies in the world, Spirit AeroSystems provides a strong fit for our team as we look to build out strong partners in the hyperloop ecosystem,\u201d says Josh Giegel, Chief Technology Officer of Virgin Hyperloop.\n\nThe company also says the supply chain is unique in the way existing technology is integrated with proprietary innovations to deliver a new transportation experience.

We are cautiously excited about a handful of innovative companies including the two highlighted here (we also previously wrote about Passage Bio (NASDAQ: PASG), a gene therapy CNS player we took a position in).\n\nALEC leverages association studies to identify genetic targets and biomarkers for immuno-neurology therapies. DNLI also takes a genetically-driven approach to target selection, and possesses a proprietary blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport platform. A look at their pipelines reveals some overlapping targets (progranulin in FTD, TREM2 in AD), reflecting the similar philosophical starting point for these companies. This article will focus on the case for and against ALEC.\n\n**Alector |** **Key Takeaways**\n\n* **ALEC does not provide sufficient value at $32.70 with a market cap of \\~$2.6B given a 12 month target price of $25 - 30.**\n* **While ALEC has strong peak sales potential, probability of technical and regulatory success is low.** While we model \\~$1.2B in peak sales potential for AL001 (\\~$550M in FTD-GRN and \\~$700M in FTD-C9orf72), we assign the FTD-GRN and FTD-C9orf72 indications a probability of approval of \\~15% and \\~10% respectively. We assess a probability of technical and regulatory success (PTRS) of \\~10% for their AbbVie-partnered AD portfolio (peak sales of \\~$10B, 50% of which goes to ALEC). After accounting for the 50:50 AbbVie profit split, the PTRS-adjusted peak sales for ALEC across their lead programs (i.e., programs with or expecting first clinical data this year) is \\~$735M. Additional upside may be driven by AL101 and other earlier-stage programs. We believe this is a generous assessment of their pipeline PTRS and does not fully capture execution risk, competitive dynamics, and underlying clinical uncertainties.\n* **In our assessment, we believe that ALEC should be priced between $25 - 30 per share.** Applying a peak sales multiple of 3.5 - 4x, we forecast a risk-adjusted valuation of $2.8B in 2024 midyear when AL001 is expected to be under regulatory evaluation / near-launch and the AD assets in pivotal trials, against the current market cap of $2.6B. Using a discount rate of 11 - 13%, this translates to a 12-month price target of $25 - 30, representing \\~25% downside over the current price of $32.70. However, given the number of potential inflection points (and fairly low bar for success given the use of biomarker endpoints in early stage trials and need for therapies) we would not be surprised if the market continues to reward ALEC despite the underlying concerns we have.\n* **While we do expect ALEC price movement driven by pipeline advancement in 2020, on a risk-adjusted basis we would not expect ALEC to hold onto these gains in the long run.** We would caution from indexing too heavily on P1/2 biomarker data as a derisking signal for pivotal development: it remains unclear the extent to which efficacy along these biomarkers will correlate with clinically meaningful impacts given the sheer complexity of neurodegeneration and cognitive function/decline.\n\n**The Case for ALEC:**\n\n* ***Multiple near-term inflection points in 2020:*** ALEC is expected to report data in the coming weeks from their P2 trial for lead asset AL001 in FTD patients with GRN and C9orf72 mutations. Key data to look out for (beyond the usual safety and PK) are impact on neurofilament light (NfL), a biomarker for neurodegeneration, and volumetric MRI (vMRI), a biomarker for brain atrophy. In P1 trials, AL001 restored plasma and CSF PGRN levels back to the normal range, a positive signal of drug activity, and reduced plasma NfL by an average of 14%. Additionally, P1b data in mild-moderate AD patients is expected for AL002 and AL003 this year, with AL002 expected to move to P2 by EOY (programs partnered with AbbVie).\n* ***Extremely strong leadership team and scientific advisory board, large industry partnership, and strong cash position***\\*\\*:\\*\\* ALEC boasts an experienced leadership team and prestigious scientific advisory board. While this is no guarantee for success, a company\u2019s ability to get thought leaders to sign on does provide some signal to potential investors that there is scientific and clinical promise. Along the same lines, we consider ALEC\u2019s large collaboration with AbbVie on their AD programs ($205M upfront for ALEC) a similar positive signal. Moreover, ALEC remains well-funded with \\~$550M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n* ***ALEC is the development leader in FTD-GRN:*** ALEC is in the pole position in FTD-GRN, though a number of competitors are poised to enter the clinic including DNLI and multiple gene therapy players (PASG, PRVL). FTD-GRN constitutes 5 - 10% of the 50 - 60 K FTD cases in the U.S., or about 3 - 6 K patients. C9orf72 variants are estimated to occur in 7 - 12% of FTD cases (4 - 7 K patients). ALEC will get to take the first shot at helping this high need population. We model approximately \\~$1.2B in peak sales potential for AL001 (\\~$550M in FTD-GRN and \\~$700M in FTD-C9orf72). However, we also note that the scientific rationale for AL001, which promotes circulating levels of PGRN by downregulation of the SORT1 degradation pathway, is less clear in the larger FTD-C9orf72 patient population.\n* ***Multiple shots on goal in AD in early-stage clinical trials with first clinical data expected this year:*** Both AL002 and AL003 target pathways implicated in AD and are in early stages of clinical development, providing ALEC two bites at the apple with P1 proof-of-mechanism data expected in 2020. Our back-of-the-envelope directional peak sales estimate for ALEC\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s franchise is \\~$10B (non-risk adjusted). ALEC is entitled to 50% of global profits. If Biogen\u2019s aducanumab is rejected, this number could conceivably climb even higher.\n\n**The Case Against ALEC:**\n\n* ***Clinical relevance of AL001\u2019s demonstrated impact on biomarkers is unclear:*** The P1 data for AL001 showed a 14% decrease from baseline in NfL plasma levels in the 5 patients available for assessment at 3 months: it is unclear if this is will prove to be clinically meaningful in FTD (for some context, disease-modifying MS therapies appear to reduce NfL by 20 - 40% after several months to years on therapy). FTD patients tend to have on average upwards of 5-7x NfL levels compared to healthy controls, so the extent to which a 14% reduction will be correlated with a clinically meaningful slowing of the neurodegenerative process is far from certain.\n* ***The strength of the scientific rationale for their lead programs is variable:*** AL001 increases PGRN by downregulating SORT1, a degradation pathway for PGRN. Early data suggests AL001 efficiently increases PGRN to normal levels, a positive indication of drug activity. However, systemic upregulation of PGRN via suppression of SORT1 may present oncogenic risks. Progranulin and its bioactive fragments are noted to be overexpressed in many cancer types. Castration-resistant prostate cancer is associated with sortilin loss and overexpressed progranulin: this is the exact pathway that AL001 modulates. Furthermore, we are also generally hesitant about AL002, which targets TREM2 in AD. TREM2\u2019s role in neurodegeneration is complex, with differing signals suggesting it may be up- or down-regulated at different points in the disease course, which leads us to take a pessimistic view regarding its potential as a drug target in AD. AL003 inhibits SIGLEC3, a unique mechanistic approach in AD.\n* ***Repeated systemic administration of biologics may present implementation barriers in the real-world for patients with neurodegeneration:*** ALEC\u2019s portfolio consists of antibodies, which may require that patients come to clinics to receive infusions. Considering the specific makeup of their target population (i.e., patients with declining cognitive function and corresponding behavioral issues and confusion), we could foresee maintaining patient compliance being challenging. We thus would predict clinical preference for a single-administration therapy (a gene therapy) or orally-delivered small molecule if possible. We would expect disproportionate Medicare representation for neurodegeneration (though not so much for FTD-GRN, an earlier-onset disease)- the introduction of step edits on Medicare Part B could feasibly even allow for a step edit through oral agents given the potential cost savings (assuming an oral is lower cost, particularly from a total cost of care perspective).\n\n**Disclosure:**\n\nWe do not own shares of Alector or Denali Therapeutics.

We are cautiously excited about a handful of innovative companies including the two highlighted here (we also previously wrote about Passage Bio (NASDAQ: PASG), a gene therapy CNS player we took a position in).\n\nALEC leverages association studies to identify genetic targets and biomarkers for immuno-neurology therapies. DNLI also takes a genetically-driven approach to target selection, and possesses a proprietary blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport platform. A look at their pipelines reveals some overlapping targets (progranulin in FTD, TREM2 in AD), reflecting the similar philosophical starting point for these companies. This article will focus on the case for and against ALEC.\n\n**Alector |** **Key Takeaways**\n\n* **ALEC does not provide sufficient value at $32.70 with a market cap of \\~$2.6B given a 12 month target price of $25 - 30.**\n* **While ALEC has strong peak sales potential, probability of technical and regulatory success is low.** While we model \\~$1.2B in peak sales potential for AL001 (\\~$550M in FTD-GRN and \\~$700M in FTD-C9orf72), we assign the FTD-GRN and FTD-C9orf72 indications a probability of approval of \\~15% and \\~10% respectively. We assess a probability of technical and regulatory success (PTRS) of \\~10% for their AbbVie-partnered AD portfolio (peak sales of \\~$10B, 50% of which goes to ALEC). After accounting for the 50:50 AbbVie profit split, the PTRS-adjusted peak sales for ALEC across their lead programs (i.e., programs with or expecting first clinical data this year) is \\~$735M. Additional upside may be driven by AL101 and other earlier-stage programs. We believe this is a generous assessment of their pipeline PTRS and does not fully capture execution risk, competitive dynamics, and underlying clinical uncertainties.\n* **In our assessment, we believe that ALEC should be priced between $25 - 30 per share.** Applying a peak sales multiple of 3.5 - 4x, we forecast a risk-adjusted valuation of $2.8B in 2024 midyear when AL001 is expected to be under regulatory evaluation / near-launch and the AD assets in pivotal trials, against the current market cap of $2.6B. Using a discount rate of 11 - 13%, this translates to a 12-month price target of $25 - 30, representing \\~25% downside over the current price of $32.70. However, given the number of potential inflection points (and fairly low bar for success given the use of biomarker endpoints in early stage trials and need for therapies) we would not be surprised if the market continues to reward ALEC despite the underlying concerns we have.\n* **While we do expect ALEC price movement driven by pipeline advancement in 2020, on a risk-adjusted basis we would not expect ALEC to hold onto these gains in the long run.** We would caution from indexing too heavily on P1/2 biomarker data as a derisking signal for pivotal development: it remains unclear the extent to which efficacy along these biomarkers will correlate with clinically meaningful impacts given the sheer complexity of neurodegeneration and cognitive function/decline.\n\n**The Case for ALEC:**\n\n* ***Multiple near-term inflection points in 2020:*** ALEC is expected to report data in the coming weeks from their P2 trial for lead asset AL001 in FTD patients with GRN and C9orf72 mutations. Key data to look out for (beyond the usual safety and PK) are impact on neurofilament light (NfL), a biomarker for neurodegeneration, and volumetric MRI (vMRI), a biomarker for brain atrophy. In P1 trials, AL001 restored plasma and CSF PGRN levels back to the normal range, a positive signal of drug activity, and reduced plasma NfL by an average of 14%. Additionally, P1b data in mild-moderate AD patients is expected for AL002 and AL003 this year, with AL002 expected to move to P2 by EOY (programs partnered with AbbVie).\n* ***Extremely strong leadership team and scientific advisory board, large industry partnership, and strong cash position***\\*\\*:\\*\\* ALEC boasts an experienced leadership team and prestigious scientific advisory board. While this is no guarantee for success, a company\u2019s ability to get thought leaders to sign on does provide some signal to potential investors that there is scientific and clinical promise. Along the same lines, we consider ALEC\u2019s large collaboration with AbbVie on their AD programs ($205M upfront for ALEC) a similar positive signal. Moreover, ALEC remains well-funded with \\~$550M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n* ***ALEC is the development leader in FTD-GRN:*** ALEC is in the pole position in FTD-GRN, though a number of competitors are poised to enter the clinic including DNLI and multiple gene therapy players (PASG, PRVL). FTD-GRN constitutes 5 - 10% of the 50 - 60 K FTD cases in the U.S., or about 3 - 6 K patients. C9orf72 variants are estimated to occur in 7 - 12% of FTD cases (4 - 7 K patients).

This article will focus on the case for and against DNLI.  \n\n\n**Denali | Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **We are cautiously excited about DNLI\u2019s pipeline and drug delivery platform, but do not expect to see durable upside in the near-term at the current valuation.**\n* **We value DNLI at \\~$5.4B versus a current market cap of \\~$2.9B based on programs with initial clinical data by 2020 (DNL201 or DNL151 in PD, DNL747 in AD and ALS).** Crucially, DNLI has not partnered out their PD program, which has peak sales potential of \\~$9B, bolstering the company valuation. This also does not include the potential of their earlier-stage programs or the value of their drug delivery platform itself.\n* Given the expected time to clinic and a discount rate of 11 - 13%, we are setting a 12 month price target of $30 - 35, **reflecting \\~20% upside to the current price of $27.83.**\n* **DNLI offers some modest near-term potential inflection points** in advancing to P2/P3 trial in PD (either DNL201 or DNL151) and a P1 readout for their Sanofi-partnered AD program in the coming months, and may also benefit indirectly from the clinical proof of concept for competitor programs with shared targets (e.g., PGRN, TREM2).\n* **While upside exists for DNLI, the upside at the current price point is not sufficient for WX Capital to initiate a position in the company.**\n\n**The Case for DNLI:**\n\n* ***Potential first-to-market disease-modifying therapy in Parkinson\u2019s Disease:*** Current agents used in PD are limited to symptom-mitigation, whereas theoretically DNLI\u2019s LRRK2-targeting agents could slow degeneration itself. The current PD global market is worth approximately $5B U.S., indicating a substantial opportunity exists for a disease-modifying treatment. Overall we model a \\~$9B peak sales opportunity in PD with \\~14% PTRS assuming DNLI is the only disease-modifying therapy available (Biogen\u2019s BIIB054 P2 trial in PD is expected to readout 2H20, and would be a key competitor).\n* ***Well-pedigreed leadership and investor team, multiple validating strategic industry partnerships, and strong cash position:*** DNLI\u2019s leadership team is largely composed of Genentech veterans, widely considered one of the more reputable and scientifically-rigorous companies in the industry. DNLI also has several bluechip investors behind them such as ARCH and Flagship. Furthermore, DNLI secured two large cornerstone partnerships with large companies in Takeda and Sanofi. The Takeda deal covers preclinical programs in FTD-GRN (DNL-593, recombinant progranulin) and AD (ATV:TREM2 and ATV:Tau) and earned DNLI $150M upfront. The Sanofi deal ($125M upfront) covers DNL747 and DNL758, small molecule drugs targeting RIPK1 in P1 for neurological (AD, ALS, MS) and peripheral inflammatory diseases (RA, psoriasis), respectively. DNLI currently has \\~$595M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n* ***Platform includes both brain-penetrant small molecules and antibodies:*** On aggregate, we prefer DNLI\u2019s technology platform given it encompasses both antibodies and brain-penetrant small molecules. In general an oral option will win out over an infused biologic assuming broadly comparable efficacy, and we believe this dynamic would be only more acute in a neurodegenerative population. Therefore, while DNLI\u2019s most advanced AD asset DNL747 is slightly trailing ALEC\u2019s programs, all else being equal we prefer DNL747 given its ROA. We are also excited about the RIPK1 target\u2019s potential across multiple indications both in and out of CNS, which we believe derisks its overall clinical development.\n* ***DNLI\u2019s blood-brain-barrier (BBB) drug delivery platform itself has meaningful value:*** DNLI has also invested in a proprietary delivery platform based on leveraging the transferrin receptor to improve CNS-targeted delivery of large molecules (e.g., antibodies and enzymes). This technology underlies their AD programs. We have the same pathway concerns for their PGRN-targeting FTD programs and TREM2-targeting AD programs as we discussed for ALEC. However, we would be interested to see how DNLI\u2019s delivery platform could potentially enable more efficient trafficking to the brain and thus allow for lower systemic dosing, improving the overall product profile for similar targets.\n\n**The Case Against DNLI:**\n\n* ***$2.9B market cap and lack of near-term catalysts does not provide predictable upside at this time:*** We model a \\~$9B opportunity in PD (\\~$1.3B PTRS-adjusted) and a \\~$3B opportunity in AD (\\~$315M PTRS-adjusted). DNLI is entitled to 50% of the AD program profits. Using a peak sales multiple of 3.5 - 4x, we assign DNLI a risk-adjusted valuation of $5.4B by approximately 2025, discounting to a 12-month price target of $30 - 35 (\\~20% upside to current price of $27.83).\n* ***Fairly early-stage clinical pipeline in high-risk indications:*** As a general observation, DNLI\u2019s pipeline is quite early-stage and as noted previously CNS development is extremely challenging. We do not have much by way of derisking proof-of-concept data at this point, so believe the PTRS for each program is in the 10 - 20% range, similar to ALEC. Additionally, DNL201 faced a partial clinical hold in P1 trials due to preclinical toxicity data, though this was ultimately removed.\n* ***Limited near-term inflection points:*** In contrast to ALEC, we do not foresee many inflection points in the next 12 months. Some milestones that are on the horizon include advancing a PD program to P2/3 (DNL201 or DNL151), P1 updates on their AD/ALS program (DNL747), and initiation of a P1/2 trial in MPS II (DNL310).

We are cautiously excited about a handful of innovative companies including the two highlighted here (we also previously wrote about Passage Bio (NASDAQ: PASG), a gene therapy CNS player we took a position in).ALEC leverages association studies to identify genetic targets and biomarkers for immuno-neurology therapies. DNLI also takes a genetically-driven approach to target selection, and possesses a proprietary blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport platform. A look at their pipelines reveals some overlapping targets (progranulin in FTD, TREM2 in AD), reflecting the similar philosophical starting point for these companies. This article will focus on the case for and against DNLI.  \n\n\n**Denali | Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **We are cautiously excited about DNLI\u2019s pipeline and drug delivery platform, but do not expect to see durable upside in the near-term at the current valuation.**\n* **We value DNLI at \\~$5.4B versus a current market cap of \\~$2.9B based on programs with initial clinical data by 2020 (DNL201 or DNL151 in PD, DNL747 in AD and ALS).** Crucially, DNLI has not partnered out their PD program, which has peak sales potential of \\~$9B, bolstering the company valuation. This also does not include the potential of their earlier-stage programs or the value of their drug delivery platform itself.\n* Given the expected time to clinic and a discount rate of 11 - 13%, we are setting a 12 month price target of $30 - 35, **reflecting \\~20% upside to the current price of $27.83.**\n* **DNLI offers some modest near-term potential inflection points** in advancing to P2/P3 trial in PD (either DNL201 or DNL151) and a P1 readout for their Sanofi-partnered AD program in the coming months, and may also benefit indirectly from the clinical proof of concept for competitor programs with shared targets (e.g., PGRN, TREM2).\n* **While upside exists for DNLI, the upside at the current price point is not sufficient for WX Capital to initiate a position in the company.**\n\n**The Case for DNLI:**\n\n* ***Potential first-to-market disease-modifying therapy in Parkinson\u2019s Disease:*** Current agents used in PD are limited to symptom-mitigation, whereas theoretically DNLI\u2019s LRRK2-targeting agents could slow degeneration itself. The current PD global market is worth approximately $5B U.S., indicating a substantial opportunity exists for a disease-modifying treatment. Overall we model a \\~$9B peak sales opportunity in PD with \\~14% PTRS assuming DNLI is the only disease-modifying therapy available (Biogen\u2019s BIIB054 P2 trial in PD is expected to readout 2H20, and would be a key competitor).\n* ***Well-pedigreed leadership and investor team, multiple validating strategic industry partnerships, and strong cash position:*** DNLI\u2019s leadership team is largely composed of Genentech veterans, widely considered one of the more reputable and scientifically-rigorous companies in the industry. DNLI also has several bluechip investors behind them such as ARCH and Flagship. Furthermore, DNLI secured two large cornerstone partnerships with large companies in Takeda and Sanofi. The Takeda deal covers preclinical programs in FTD-GRN (DNL-593, recombinant progranulin) and AD (ATV:TREM2 and ATV:Tau) and earned DNLI $150M upfront. The Sanofi deal ($125M upfront) covers DNL747 and DNL758, small molecule drugs targeting RIPK1 in P1 for neurological (AD, ALS, MS) and peripheral inflammatory diseases (RA, psoriasis), respectively. DNLI currently has \\~$595M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n* ***Platform includes both brain-penetrant small molecules and antibodies:*** On aggregate, we prefer DNLI\u2019s technology platform given it encompasses both antibodies and brain-penetrant small molecules. In general an oral option will win out over an infused biologic assuming broadly comparable efficacy, and we believe this dynamic would be only more acute in a neurodegenerative population. Therefore, while DNLI\u2019s most advanced AD asset DNL747 is slightly trailing ALEC\u2019s programs, all else being equal we prefer DNL747 given its ROA. We are also excited about the RIPK1 target\u2019s potential across multiple indications both in and out of CNS, which we believe derisks its overall clinical development.\n* ***DNLI\u2019s blood-brain-barrier (BBB) drug delivery platform itself has meaningful value:*** DNLI has also invested in a proprietary delivery platform based on leveraging the transferrin receptor to improve CNS-targeted delivery of large molecules (e.g., antibodies and enzymes). This technology underlies their AD programs. We have the same pathway concerns for their PGRN-targeting FTD programs and TREM2-targeting AD programs as we discussed for ALEC. However, we would be interested to see how DNLI\u2019s delivery platform could potentially enable more efficient trafficking to the brain and thus allow for lower systemic dosing, improving the overall product profile for similar targets.\n\n**The Case Against DNLI:**\n\n* ***$2.9B market cap and lack of near-term catalysts does not provide predictable upside at this time:*** We model a \\~$9B opportunity in PD (\\~$1.3B PTRS-adjusted) and a \\~$3B opportunity in AD (\\~$315M PTRS-adjusted). DNLI is entitled to 50% of the AD program profits. Using a peak sales multiple of 3.5 - 4x, we assign DNLI a risk-adjusted valuation of $5.4B by approximately 2025, discounting to a 12-month price target of $30 - 35 (\\~20% upside to current price of $27.83).\n* ***Fairly early-stage clinical pipeline in high-risk indications:*** As a general observation, DNLI\u2019s pipeline is quite early-stage and as noted previously CNS development is extremely challenging. We do not have much by way of derisking proof-of-concept data at this point, so believe the PTRS for each program is in the 10 - 20% range, similar to ALEC. Additionally, DNL201 faced a partial clinical hold in P1 trials due to preclinical toxicity data, though this was ultimately removed.\n* ***Limited near-term inflection points:*** In contrast to ALEC, we do not foresee many inflection points in the next 12 months. Some milestones that are on the horizon include advancing a PD program to P2/3 (DNL201 or DNL151), P1 updates on their AD/ALS program (DNL747), and initiation of a P1/2 trial in MPS II (DNL310). We also would not be surprised to see updates from the Sanofi-led DNL758 program in peripheral inflammation or on other early-stage programs, but do not anticipate many other needle-moving events.\n\n**Disclosure:** We do not own shares of Alector or Denali Therapeutics.

The company has two clinical stage drugs, ARV-110 and ARV-471, for prostate cancer and breast cancer. Recent Phase 1 data from ARV-110 was received negatively and drove a \\~40% drop in the stock, but we believe the data actually shows proof-of-concept for Arvinas\u2019 platform and the recent weakness in the stock presents a significant buying opportunity. **Our valuation yields a per share value of $50, implying close to 60% upside from \\~$30 today.**\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* Arvinas\u2019 PROTAC protein degradation technology is a unique, highly differentiated drug platform with therapeutic potential in numerous protein-driven disease areas including oncology and neurology. The PROTAC platform has the potential to quickly develop drugs that hit existing protein targets harder than traditional inhibitors do as well as address previously undruggable proteins.\n* Arvinas has two drugs in the clinic: ARV-110 for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and ARV-471 for metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer; both are in Phase 1 development and have the potential to change the treatment paradigm for their respective diseases.\n* As of 1Q20, Arvinas had $260M of cash as of 1Q20, expected to be sufficient to fund operations into 2022.\n* Though the stock has now dropped close to 40% since initial ARV-110 Phase 1 data was first released in mid-May, we believe this was a knee-jerk reaction that ignores the proof-of-concept demonstrated by the data. The data showed evidence of PROTAC-directed degradation of AR, signals of clinical efficacy, as well as a generally favorable safety profile that we believe should be viewed as encouraging signs.\n* With the stock now at $33, we are positive on Arvinas\u2019 risk-reward heading into additional data readouts in 2H20. These include additional ARV-110 Phase 1 data and first-in-human data from ARV-471, both of which should be major stock-moving events. Based on our valuation (described in detail further down) of $50/share using conservative estimates, we see the recent weakness in the stock as an attractive entry point to potentially capture 60% upside.\n\n**Details**\n\n**Arvinas\u2019 PROTAC technology is a differentiated protein degradation platform with therapeutic potential in multiple disease areas.**\n\n* PROTAC, short for proteolysis targeting chimeras, takes advantage of the body\u2019s natural protein disposal system to selectively degrade proteins involved in disease. A key player in this process is the E3 ligase, an enzyme that naturally identifies mutated/misfolded proteins and tags them with a protein called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin-tagged proteins are then naturally recognized by a complex called the proteasome that degrades them into their constituent peptides.\n* Arvinas\u2019 PROTAC molecules are designed to recruit a specific E3 ligase (there are over 600 types) to a specified target protein and tag it for degradation. After degradation, the ubiquitin and PROTAC are recycled and can continue to recruit and tag target proteins. This focus on matching ligands to proteins could also confer advantages in development speed, as Arvinas could potentially target different proteins with the same ligase, eliminating the need to design a completely new molecule. The general process is visually outlined below (diagram from Arvinas poster publication).\n* Compared to typical drugs that only inhibit the activity of mutated proteins, a protein degradation approach could have several advantages. First, completely eliminating mutated proteins through degradation could confer greater therapeutic benefit versus inhibition alone. Moreover, in preclinical testing, PROTACs have shown the ability to distinguish between wild-type (unmutated) protein and proteins with single point mutations (e.g. WT BRAF vs. BRAF V600E), suggesting a high degree of selectivity. Finally, PROTACs do not need to bind as strongly to target proteins as much as inhibitors do in order to take effect, so they can potentially interact with and tag previously \u201cundruggable\u201d proteins. As up to \\~80% of known proteins are considered \u201cundruggable\u201d by traditional inhibitory drugs, PROTAC could be a paradigm-shifting technology in cancer and beyond.\n* Arvinas is exploring PROTAC\u2019s therapeutic potential in multiple disease areas, starting with oncology. Moreover, preclinical data has suggested that PROTACs can cross the blood-brain barrier, which if true, would make them ideal for targeting all sorts of proteins involved in neurodegenerative disease including Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n* Arvinas has signed collaboration agreements with Bayer, Genentech, and Pfizer to develop drugs based on PROTAC.\n\n**Arvinas is testing ARV-110 in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), a patient population with a dire need for improved treatment options.**\n\n* Prostate cancer is the second most prevalent cancer and second leading cause of death for men in the US (an estimated 33,000 deaths are expected in 2020), with an estimated 1 in 9 men experiencing prostate cancer in their lifetime.\n* The overexpression of androgen receptor (AR) is a known driver of prostate cancer, and current standard of care targets AR using drugs including enzalutamide and abiraterone in combination with chemotherapy. However, up to 25% of patients never respond to these treatments, and the vast majority of patients will eventually progress to a castration-resistant state, necessitating the need for a new treatment modality.\n* ARV-110 is designed to facilitate the degradation of AR and has shown the ability to inhibit tumor growth 70-100% in enzalutamide-resistant mouse models. Initial in-human safety data released in October also showed promise, with no dose-limiting toxicities or treatment-related adverse events in 10 patients who had been on treatment for a month. Expanded Phase 1 data is discussed below.\n\n**ARV-471 has shown potential in metastatic ER+ breast cancer.**\n\n* ARV-471 is a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that uses the PROTAC platform to, as the name suggests, selectively target estrogen receptors for degradation. ARV-471 is currently in a Phase 1 dose escalation trial for ER+ breast cancer, and initial results reported in October 2019 showed that patients had drug exposure levels in the predicted efficacious range with no dose limiting toxicities. Expanded results on safety/efficacy are expected by YE20.\n\n**Phase 1 ARV-110 data was viewed as underwhelming but still showed proof-of-concept, and the stock overreaction creates an attractive entry point.**\n\n* Arvinas\u2019 Phase 1 trial for ARV-110 is a dose escalation study testing doses of 35mg up to 420mg in third-line mCRPC patients with the primary endpoint of identifying a Phase 2 dose and secondary endpoint of assessing early safety/efficacy data.\n* Arvinas disclosed first-in-human data for ARV-110 at ASCO on May 29. The data was perceived as disappointing, driving the stock down as much as 30%, with only 2/12 patients (17%) at the 140mg dose showing responses (no responses were observed at the lower doses).\n* However, we don\u2019t think the data is quite as bad as the market\u2019s reaction suggests. Of the 12 patients dosed at 140mg, 5 had mutations that made them unlikely to respond to ARV-110; excluding these patients bumps up the response rate to 2/7 (29%). Arvinas could (and should) screen for these mutations in future trials to enroll a more selective patient population more likely to respond to the drug. Importantly, both responders had mutations known to drive resistance to mCRPC standard of care, an encouraging sign for ARV-110\u2019s potential in 3L patients.\n* Nevertheless, despite our optimistic take on the data, it is too early to make meaningful conclusions about ARV-110\u2019s efficacy, and there are still outstanding questions about ARV-110 that place increased emphasis on the expanded Phase 1 data readout (expected by YE20). These include whether ARV-110 can show a dose dependent response at the higher 240mg and 480mg doses, as well as if additional responses will occur and if current responses will deepen or be sustained.\n\n**Valuation**\n\n* We arrive at a $50/share value for Arvinas using a sum-of-the-parts analysis. Our valuation assumes a launch year of 2024 for ARV-110 (35% Probability of Success or POS) and 2025 for ARV-471 (20% POS), with each respectively reaching unadjusted peak sales of \\~$900M and \\~$1.4B four years post-launch. We use a 6.5x peak sales multiple for both assets and a discount rate of 12%.\n* We did not assign value to Arvinas\u2019 undisclosed preclinical oncology assets or its early-stage neurology pipeline, but they represent possible upside.\n\n**Key Risks**\n\n* **Clinical/regulatory failure.** Arvinas is exposed to the same set of clinical and regulatory risks as many of its biotech peers. This risk is particularly relevant for Arvinas and its novel PROTAC platform, and Phase 1 data from ARV-110 and ARV-471 will be crucial in legitimizing PROTAC\u2019s mechanism of action, both for Arvinas\u2019 commercial prospects in oncology as well as future drugs based on PROTAC. Future risks include negative regulatory feedback from the FDA or problems in the execution of manufacturing/commercialization activities.\n* **Competitive risk.** Protein degradation is not an approach unique to Arvina; there are multiple companies pursuing protein degradation such as private companies C4 Therapeutics and Kymera Therapeutics as well as larger biopharmas including Roche, Amgen, and Novartis. However, it is too early to draw any conclusions about any company\u2019s technology as Arvinas is the first of these companies with in-human data and remains the tone setter for the entire field as its trials progress. Beyond protein degradation, there is also the risk that ARV-110/ARV-471, if approved, do not experience the commercial success that we expect due to competing therapies on the market.\n\n**Disclosure:**\n\nWe, WX Capital, a team of ex-biotech consultants, currently own shares of Arvinas.

The company has two clinical stage drugs, ARV-110 and ARV-471, for prostate cancer and breast cancer. Recent Phase 1 data from ARV-110 was received negatively and drove a \\~40% drop in the stock, but we believe the data actually shows proof-of-concept for Arvinas\u2019 platform and the recent weakness in the stock presents a significant buying opportunity. **Our valuation yields a per share value of $50, implying close to 60% upside from \\~$30 today.**\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* Arvinas\u2019 PROTAC protein degradation technology is a unique, highly differentiated drug platform with therapeutic potential in numerous protein-driven disease areas including oncology and neurology. The PROTAC platform has the potential to quickly develop drugs that hit existing protein targets harder than traditional inhibitors do as well as address previously undruggable proteins.\n* Arvinas has two drugs in the clinic: ARV-110 for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and ARV-471 for metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer; both are in Phase 1 development and have the potential to change the treatment paradigm for their respective diseases.\n* As of 1Q20, Arvinas had $260M of cash as of 1Q20, expected to be sufficient to fund operations into 2022.\n* Though the stock has now dropped close to 40% since initial ARV-110 Phase 1 data was first released in mid-May, we believe this was a knee-jerk reaction that ignores the proof-of-concept demonstrated by the data. The data showed evidence of PROTAC-directed degradation of AR, signals of clinical efficacy, as well as a generally favorable safety profile that we believe should be viewed as encouraging signs.\n* With the stock now at $33, we are positive on Arvinas\u2019 risk-reward heading into additional data readouts in 2H20. These include additional ARV-110 Phase 1 data and first-in-human data from ARV-471, both of which should be major stock-moving events. Based on our valuation (described in detail further down) of $50/share using conservative estimates, we see the recent weakness in the stock as an attractive entry point to potentially capture 60% upside.\n\n**Details**\n\n**Arvinas\u2019 PROTAC technology is a differentiated protein degradation platform with therapeutic potential in multiple disease areas.**\n\n* PROTAC, short for proteolysis targeting chimeras, takes advantage of the body\u2019s natural protein disposal system to selectively degrade proteins involved in disease. A key player in this process is the E3 ligase, an enzyme that naturally identifies mutated/misfolded proteins and tags them with a protein called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin-tagged proteins are then naturally recognized by a complex called the proteasome that degrades them into their constituent peptides.\n* Arvinas\u2019 PROTAC molecules are designed to recruit a specific E3 ligase (there are over 600 types) to a specified target protein and tag it for degradation. After degradation, the ubiquitin and PROTAC are recycled and can continue to recruit and tag target proteins. This focus on matching ligands to proteins could also confer advantages in development speed, as Arvinas could potentially target different proteins with the same ligase, eliminating the need to design a completely new molecule. The general process is visually outlined below (diagram from Arvinas poster publication).\n* Compared to typical drugs that only inhibit the activity of mutated proteins, a protein degradation approach could have several advantages. First, completely eliminating mutated proteins through degradation could confer greater therapeutic benefit versus inhibition alone. Moreover, in preclinical testing, PROTACs have shown the ability to distinguish between wild-type (unmutated) protein and proteins with single point mutations (e.g. WT BRAF vs. BRAF V600E), suggesting a high degree of selectivity. Finally, PROTACs do not need to bind as strongly to target proteins as much as inhibitors do in order to take effect, so they can potentially interact with and tag previously \u201cundruggable\u201d proteins. As up to \\~80% of known proteins are considered \u201cundruggable\u201d by traditional inhibitory drugs, PROTAC could be a paradigm-shifting technology in cancer and beyond.\n* Arvinas is exploring PROTAC\u2019s therapeutic potential in multiple disease areas, starting with oncology.

Why do DD when you can see what other people are heavily investing in? A list of previous plays as well as resources are available at [https://www.noeticoptions.com/](https://www.noeticoptions.com/).\n\nRecap \u2013 SPY ended down -.61% today. The picks yesterday did worse than the SPY with FTCH ending at -.42 or -2.70% and EVRI -.50 or -6.42%. If you entered this morning you likely got these shares at a discount. I entered after hours near the close of the day on each of these so I am currently at a loss. EVRI I have decided to shift into a medium term hold with a TP of about $10 and a SL around 6. There was significant volume at the Jun 19 \u201920 10C and 12.5C today. FTCH still had some Jun 19\u201920 16C volume of 3.43k and an OI of 8.43k. I will check tomorrow morning for the OI change. If the volume today represents investors exiting their calls I too will likely exit the position in the AM. If the stock and OI increases I will likely hold through the day and look for movement. Their investor Conference is June 11th (mentioned in last post). Stop loss is around 14.50 on this trade.\n\nSite update \u2013 The resources section was updated with a collection of useful links I\u2019ve seen on reddit.

On a down day for the market FEYE ended up almost 4%. I\u2019ve seen this stock show up a few times and invested in it last month based on this information at around $10 and rode it up to about $12. I cannot find any upcoming conferences or news about the stock to justify the call buying. Seems like a decent bet to me.\n\n***2.***  ***Ticker :*** ***CNHI***\n\n**Spot Price** : 8.03 (-.10, -1.23%)\n\n**Company Summary** (from Yahoo Finance)**:** CNH Industrial N.V. designs, produces, markets, sells, and finances agricultural and construction equipment, trucks, commercial vehicles, buses, specialty vehicles, and powertrain products in North America, Europe, South America, and internationally.

Yesterday they presented at the Deutsche Bank 11th Annual Virtual Global Industrials and Materials Summit 2020. It\u2019s unclear how much of the call volume today for the JUN 19 \u201920 10C contract was selling of the previous calls or true call buying. Check the OI tomorrow morning for confirmation. The JUL 17 \u201920 10C with the twice the VLM as the OI should have been some significant new calls being bought.\n\n**CLASSIC UNUSUAL OPTIONS ACTIVITY \u2013**\n\nCan be found at [www.noeticoptions.com](https://www.noeticoptions.com/) .\n\nSummary :\n\nEVRI I have shifted to look at holding for a longer term with a SL of 6 and TP of 10. FTCH has an investor conference on the 11th.\n\nFEYE had significant bullish activity today and I cannot identify a reason why at this time. I\u2019ll be watching this one for a possible entry point tomorrow or pre-market.\n\nCNHI will also need to be monitored tomorrow.

Why do DD when you can see what other people are heavily investing in? A list of previous plays as well as resources are available at [https://www.noeticoptions.com/](https://www.noeticoptions.com/).\n\nRecap \u2013 SPY ended down -.61% today. The picks yesterday did worse than the SPY with FTCH ending at -.42 or -2.70% and EVRI -.50 or -6.42%. If you entered this morning you likely got these shares at a discount. I entered after hours near the close of the day on each of these so I am currently at a loss. EVRI I have decided to shift into a medium term hold with a TP of about $10 and a SL around 6. There was significant volume at the Jun 19 \u201920 10C and 12.5C today. FTCH still had some Jun 19\u201920 16C volume of 3.43k and an OI of 8.43k. I will check tomorrow morning for the OI change. If the volume today represents investors exiting their calls I too will likely exit the position in the AM. If the stock and OI increases I will likely hold through the day and look for movement. Their investor Conference is June 11th (mentioned in last post). Stop loss is around 14.50 on this trade.\n\nSite update \u2013 The resources section was updated with a collection of useful links I\u2019ve seen on reddit.

On a down day for the market FEYE ended up almost 4%. I\u2019ve seen this stock show up a few times and invested in it last month based on this information at around $10 and rode it up to about $12. I cannot find any upcoming conferences or news about the stock to justify the call buying. Seems like a decent bet to me.\n\n***2.***  ***Ticker :*** ***CNHI***\n\n**Spot Price** : 8.03 (-.10, -1.23%)\n\n**Company Summary** (from Yahoo Finance)**:** CNH Industrial N.V. designs, produces, markets, sells, and finances agricultural and construction equipment, trucks, commercial vehicles, buses, specialty vehicles, and powertrain products in North America, Europe, South America, and internationally.

Yesterday they presented at the Deutsche Bank 11th Annual Virtual Global Industrials and Materials Summit 2020. It\u2019s unclear how much of the call volume today for the JUN 19 \u201920 10C contract was selling of the previous calls or true call buying. Check the OI tomorrow morning for confirmation. The JUL 17 \u201920 10C with the twice the VLM as the OI should have been some significant new calls being bought.\n\n**CLASSIC UNUSUAL OPTIONS ACTIVITY \u2013**\n\nCan be found at [www.noeticoptions.com](https://www.noeticoptions.com/) .\n\nSummary :\n\nEVRI I have shifted to look at holding for a longer term with a SL of 6 and TP of 10. FTCH has an investor conference on the 11th.\n\nFEYE had significant bullish activity today and I cannot identify a reason why at this time. I\u2019ll be watching this one for a possible entry point tomorrow or pre-market.\n\nCNHI will also need to be monitored tomorrow. If I enter I\u2019ll likely do less shares and hold for a longer period of time due to most of the strikes being bought further out in July.\n\nAs always thanks for reading.\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 These are my observations that I have made at the end of each day and trades that I am considering placing or watching.

In fact I would not be able to do my job without ZoomInfo. Allow me to further explain.\n\nZoomInfo is a database of contacts at all kinds of companies. They have millions of people in their system, from around the world - CEO\u2019s and VP\u2019s at Fortune 500 companies, and also info on people at smaller companies and everyone in between.

Even though coldcalling is not socially acceptable for consumer products, within B2B sales it is standard practice and acceptable.\n\nNow here\u2019s the thing - in order to do outbound sales at scale required for growth - you need A LOT of people\u2019s contact info - you need accurate info - and the best info you can get is their cell phone - rather than their desk phone.\n\nAs a sales professional - I\u2019ve evaluated probably over 10 services that offer contact information.

POMC and LEPR deficiency obesity are extremely rare (100 - 500 and 500 - 2000 patients in the U.S., respectively) and severe disorders that result in exponential weight gain that cannot be reversed through diet, exercise, or current therapies. RYTM\u2019s setmelanotide development program is rounded out with an additional pivotal P3 trial in Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) and Alstrom Syndrome (AS) (primary completion: 06/30/2020) and a P2 basket trial across 6 other genetically-defined rare obesity disorders implicating the MC4R pathway (see below diagram). Setmelanotide has demonstrated clinically meaningful weight loss in trials to date and we expect FDA approval in POMC and LEPR (\\~90% probability). We assign the BBS and AS program \\~80% probability of P3 success and \\~90% probability of approval (\\~70% cumulative probability of technical and regulatory success (PTRS)) given proof of concept from POMC and LEPR pivotal trials and positive P2 data in BBS and AS. Cumulatively, we are expecting setmelanotide to drive a $750 - 1,350M global (U.S. + EU) peak sales opportunity ($590 - 800M PTRS-adjusted) depending on indication expansion. We believe this supports a valuation of $1.6 - 2.2B using a peak sales multiplier of 2.5 - 3x, representing \\~145% upside over the current \\~$890M market cap.\n\n**Figure Taken From Rhythm Corporate Presentation (May 2020)**  \n\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* RYTM\u2019s lead asset setmelanotide is anticipated to secure its first FDA approvals by November 2020 and possesses cumulative blockbuster sales potential across rare MC4R-associated genetic obesities.\n* Positive pivotal data in lead indications POMC and LEPR and strong P2 data in BSS and AS provides clinical evidence of the therapeutic benefit of MC4R agonism in this pathway, mitigating development risk for follow-on indications. Prior research we\u2019ve conducted with physicians managing obese patients indicated that \u226510% weight loss from baseline is considered a highly potent effect: setmelanotide demonstrated an average of 25.4% and 12.4% weight loss in POMC and LEPR pivotal trials, respectively.\n* We forecast the cumulative setmelanotide peak sales to reach $1.3B ($800M PTRS-adjusted). Current pivotal programs (POMC, LEPR, BBS, and AS) alone collectively drive a \\~$750M (\\~$590M PTRS-adjusted) peak opportunity, with the P2 indications contributing the additional $570M (\\~$200M PTRS-adjusted).\n* We therefore assign RYTM a $1.6 - 2.2B PTRS-adjusted valuation using a peak sales multiple of 2.5 - 3x, offering \\~145% upside against a current market cap of \\~$890 M. \n* As with all orphan drugs, commercial success will hinge on RYTM\u2019s ability to shift clinical practice and drive patient testing and identification, and we are reassured through the efforts RYTM has already made to engage patient advocacy groups and clinicians. \n\n**Key Stock Drivers:**\n\n* ***Late-stage asset in an area of high unmet need:*** Genetically-driven obesities are associated with high clinical unmet need given the clinical, social, and familial impacts of extreme obesity and lack of efficacious interventions today. An FDA-approved drug would therefore be anticipated to drive high clinical demand and benefit from favorable pricing and access.\n* ***Positive pivotal trial data and orphan designation confer high probability of approval*****:** After one year, 8/10 POMC and 5/11 LEPR patients in pivotal trials achieved \u226510% weight loss from baseline, with an average weight loss of 25.4% (70.2 lbs) and 12.4% (36.8 lbs) in the POMC and LEPR trials, respectively. We thus predict a high probability (\u226590%) of FDA approval by the November PDUFA date. Furthermore, these data help to validate that modulation of the MC4R pathway with setmelanotide is therapeutically useful, derisking RYTM\u2019s other setmelanotide trials (BBS, AS, and others).\n* ***Multiple near-term inflection points:*** Key near-term inflection points include setmelanotide\u2019s November 2020 PDUFA date, topline P3 readout for BBS and AS in 4Q20 or 1Q21, and an update from the P2 basket trial in other MC4R-associated rare genetic obesities. Beyond setmelanotide, RYTM also reported plans to file an IND for RM-853 for Prader-Willi Syndrome by 2020 EOY.\n* ***We forecast a***  ***$750 - 1,350M peak sales opportunity (PTRS-adjusted $590 - 800M) for setmelanotide, supporting a $1.6 - 2.2B PTRS-adjusted valuation:*** POMC and LEPR together represent a \\~$230M (\\~$210M PTRS-adjusted) peak opportunity, with BBS and AS contributing \\~$530 M (\\~$385 M PTRS-adjusted) and P2 indications adding an additional \\~$570M (\\~$200M PTRS-adjusted).\n\n**Key Stock Risks:**\n\n* ***Regulatory risk, while limited, exists given small clinical trials:*** While we do not consider setmelanotide\u2019s small clinical trials to be a barrier to approval given precedent in orphan drug development, we acknowledge that the FDA may balk at the low number of treated patients and mandate additional data. However, even if this is the case, we hypothesize that the most likely outcome would be a conditional approval and required post-marketing study.\n* ***Identifying and activating patients for treatment will be challenging:*** Genetic testing for these indications is extremely low due to the absence of an approved therapy. As with most orphan drug developers, RYTM will have to invest extensively in clinician and patient awareness and access to testing to drive identification of therapy-eligible patients. This substantially increases the execution risk for setmelanotide even if regulatory approval is obtained. RYTM is laying the foundation for these critical efforts through relationships with disease-specific patient advocacy groups, putting medical teams in the field to engage clinicians, and sponsoring a genetic testing program for rare obesities. Nonetheless, patient identification likely presents the greatest downside risk for RYTM.\n* ***Reported epidemiology may be inaccurate:*** As with many orphan diseases, the epidemiology for setmelanotide\u2019s target indications is far from definitively understood. Therefore, there is the risk that the sources used significantly overestimate the total addressable population.\n* ***Public and political pressure on drug pricing:*** setmelanotide, as an orphan drug, is expected to carry a high per-patient annual price. While historically orphan drug pricing has been extremely favorable, increased public scrutiny and \u201csticker shock\u201d may constrain pricing potential in the future. We and other analysts forecast a launch price of $350 K / year in the U.S., in-line with many chronic orphan drugs, which we do not anticipate will trigger any broader scrutiny at launch given the small patient populations. However, the risk does exist that setmelanotide gets caught up in the larger conversation around value and cost-effectiveness, particularly in ex-U.S. markets. \n\nDisclosure:\n\nWe, WX Capital, a team of ex-biotech consultants, own shares of Rhythm Pharmaceuticals.

Yesterday, COVID-related trial delays for REPL outweighed extremely positive trial data, resulting in a 10% initial sell-off before recovering completely at the end of the trading day. Today, REPL finally reacted to the extremely positive trial data, resulting in a near 20% jump in price. As mentioned below, we believe there is additional upside even after today's rally. Disclosure: we own shares of REPL purchased on 6/2. Read more below:\n\n\\---   \n\n**Summary:** Replimune (NASDAQ: REPL) is developing a next-generation oncolytic immunotherapy platform. Their lead candidate, RP1, is an engineered herpes simplex virus designed to both selectively infect and destroy tumor cells and maximize a patient\u2019s own immune response to the tumor cells. The latter function could potentially turn \u201con\u201d tumors that the immune system was previously ignoring. REPL will be providing a data update from the P2 portion of their ongoing P1/2 trial for RP1 + Opdivo **tomorrow pre-market (8 AM EST).** The update will consist of readouts for the melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer cohorts. We are excited about this readout given the positive P1 data previously reported in November 2019 and the substantial market opportunity for RP1 in their lead indications. We believe REPL has the potential to go on a significant run over the next 12-months driven by multiple near-term clinical milestones.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* ***REPL has extensive oncolytic development experience:*** The team was previously at BioVex, which led the development of the first FDA-approved oncolytic therapy (Imlygic) and was purchased by Amgen for $1B in 2011 ($425M upfront). While Imlygic has not lived up to commercial expectations, we are excited about the preliminary data we have seen for RP1 and the combination regimen and biomarker-driven approach REPL is taking.\n* ***Positive P1 data provides proof of concept for RP1:*** REPL reported positive P1 data last November for RP1 alone and in combination with Opdivo. In the monotherapy arm, tumor destruction was observed following RP1 administration, indicating RP1\u2019s independent antitumor activity. REPL also reported that 3/4 patients with PD-1-refractory cutaneous melanoma were respondents, suggesting RP1 may benefit patients who fail to respond to current best therapies. Moreover, 4/5 cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) patients responded to the RP1 + Opdivo combination, supporting the efficacy of the combination regimen. Interestingly, RP1 administration was associated with increased PD-L1 and CD8 T cells in the tumor tissue: this suggests RP1 successfully enhanced T cell tumor penetration and could potentially turn tumors \u201con\u201d for checkpoint inhibitor therapies (like Opdivo), leading to synergistic efficacy. These combinations with checkpoint inhibitors hold a lot of mutual promise, as borne out by the support BMS and REGN are providing furnished REPL for the combination studies with Opdivo and Libtayo, respectively.\n* ***Multiple near-term readouts in 2020 expected:*** An update for the RP1 + Opdivo melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer cohorts is scheduled for tomorrow, while data in the bladder cancer and MSI-H cohorts is expected 4Q20. We also expect updates for the potentially registrational P2 RP1 + Libtayo in CSCC in 2021.\n* ***We foresee substantial upside for REPL over the next year (25 - 100%),*** **and are setting our target price at $27, representing 35% upside over our entry price of $20**\\*\\*\\*:\\*\\*\\* We are excited about the data released to date and anticipate further positive news tomorrow, which we believe will set REPL up for further growth over the next 12 months. We have seen reported peak sales forecasts for RP1 in the range of $1.7B. We believe that would be an optimistic forecast, with our back-of-the-envelope analysis indicating peak sales potential in the $1.1B range. There is substantial growth potential at the current price (market cap of \\~$730M). Our rapid analysis of REPL is supported by other analyst coverage, with 12-month consensus price targets in the mid-20s to low-30\u2019s range, representing meaningful upside over the current \\~$20 price.

Their lead candidate, RP1, is an engineered herpes simplex virus designed to both selectively infect and destroy tumor cells and maximize a patient\u2019s own immune response to the tumor cells. The latter function could potentially turn \u201con\u201d tumors that the immune system was previously ignoring. REPL will be providing a data update from the P2 portion of their ongoing P1/2 trial for RP1 + Opdivo **tomorrow pre-market (8 AM EST).** The update will consist of readouts for the melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer cohorts. We are excited about this readout given the positive P1 data previously reported in November 2019 and the substantial market opportunity for RP1 in their lead indications. We believe REPL has the potential to go on a significant run over the next 12-months driven by multiple near-term clinical milestones.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* ***REPL has extensive oncolytic development experience:*** The team was previously at BioVex, which led the development of the first FDA-approved oncolytic therapy (Imlygic) and was purchased by Amgen for $1B in 2011 ($425M upfront). While Imlygic has not lived up to commercial expectations, we are excited about the preliminary data we have seen for RP1 and the combination regimen and biomarker-driven approach REPL is taking.\n* ***Positive P1 data provides proof of concept for RP1:*** REPL reported positive P1 data last November for RP1 alone and in combination with Opdivo. In the monotherapy arm, tumor destruction was observed following RP1 administration, indicating RP1\u2019s independent antitumor activity. REPL also reported that 3/4 patients with PD-1-refractory cutaneous melanoma were respondents, suggesting RP1 may benefit patients who fail to respond to current best therapies. Moreover, 4/5 cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) patients responded to the RP1 + Opdivo combination, supporting the efficacy of the combination regimen. Interestingly, RP1 administration was associated with increased PD-L1 and CD8 T cells in the tumor tissue: this suggests RP1 successfully enhanced T cell tumor penetration and could potentially turn tumors \u201con\u201d for checkpoint inhibitor therapies (like Opdivo), leading to synergistic efficacy. These combinations with checkpoint inhibitors hold a lot of mutual promise, as borne out by the support BMS and REGN are providing furnished REPL for the combination studies with Opdivo and Libtayo, respectively.\n* ***Multiple near-term readouts in 2020 expected:*** An update for the RP1 + Opdivo melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer cohorts is scheduled for tomorrow, while data in the bladder cancer and MSI-H cohorts is expected 4Q20. We also expect updates for the potentially registrational P2 RP1 + Libtayo in CSCC in 2021.\n* ***We foresee substantial upside for REPL over the next year (25 - 100%),*** **and are setting our target price at $27, representing 35% upside over our entry price of $20**\\*\\*\\*:\\*\\*\\* We are excited about the data released to date and anticipate further positive news tomorrow, which we believe will set REPL up for further growth over the next 12 months.

Their lead candidate, RP1, is an engineered herpes simplex virus designed to both selectively infect and destroy tumor cells and maximize a patient\u2019s own immune response to the tumor cells. The latter function could potentially turn \u201con\u201d tumors that the immune system was previously ignoring. REPL will be providing a data update from the P2 portion of their ongoing P1/2 trial for RP1 + Opdivo **tomorrow pre-market (8 AM EST).** The update will consist of readouts for the melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer cohorts. We are excited about this readout given the positive P1 data previously reported in November 2019 and the substantial market opportunity for RP1 in their lead indications. We believe REPL has the potential to go on a significant run over the next 12-months driven by multiple near-term clinical milestones.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* ***REPL has extensive oncolytic development experience:*** The team was previously at BioVex, which led the development of the first FDA-approved oncolytic therapy (Imlygic) and was purchased by Amgen for $1B in 2011 ($425M upfront). While Imlygic has not lived up to commercial expectations, we are excited about the preliminary data we have seen for RP1 and the combination regimen and biomarker-driven approach REPL is taking.\n* ***Positive P1 data provides proof of concept for RP1:*** REPL reported positive P1 data last November for RP1 alone and in combination with Opdivo. In the monotherapy arm, tumor destruction was observed following RP1 administration, indicating RP1\u2019s independent antitumor activity. REPL also reported that 3/4 patients with PD-1-refractory cutaneous melanoma were respondents, suggesting RP1 may benefit patients who fail to respond to current best therapies. Moreover, 4/5 cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) patients responded to the RP1 + Opdivo combination, supporting the efficacy of the combination regimen. Interestingly, RP1 administration was associated with increased PD-L1 and CD8 T cells in the tumor tissue: this suggests RP1 successfully enhanced T cell tumor penetration and could potentially turn tumors \u201con\u201d for checkpoint inhibitor therapies (like Opdivo), leading to synergistic efficacy. These combinations with checkpoint inhibitors hold a lot of mutual promise, as borne out by the support BMS and REGN are providing furnished REPL for the combination studies with Opdivo and Libtayo, respectively.\n* ***Multiple near-term readouts in 2020 expected:*** An update for the RP1 + Opdivo melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer cohorts is scheduled for tomorrow, while data in the bladder cancer and MSI-H cohorts is expected 4Q20. We also expect updates for the potentially registrational P2 RP1 + Libtayo in CSCC in 2021.\n* ***We foresee substantial upside for REPL over the next year (25 - 100%),*** **and are setting our target price at $27, representing 35% upside over our entry price of $20**\\*\\*\\*:\\*\\*\\* We are excited about the data released to date and anticipate further positive news tomorrow, which we believe will set REPL up for further growth over the next 12 months. We have seen reported peak sales forecasts for RP1 in the range of $1.7B. We believe that would be an optimistic forecast, with our back-of-the-envelope analysis indicating peak sales potential in the $1.1B range. There is substantial growth potential at the current price (market cap of \\~$730M). Our rapid analysis of REPL is supported by other analyst coverage, with 12-month consensus price targets in the mid-20s to low-30\u2019s range, representing meaningful upside over the current \\~$20 price. We believe that positive data tomorrow has the potential to drive the price to the \\~$27 range.\n\n***Additional value in RP2 and RP3, highly engineered follow-on assets:*** While early stage, we are excited to see REPL continue to innovate and arm their oncolytic therapy candidates with further functionality designed to enhance immune response to targeted tumor cells.\n\nDisclosure:\n\nWe, WX Capital, a team of ex-life-science consultants with a trading and research firm, own shares of Replimune Group.

This leads to rising healthcare costs. Knees, hips and other parts of the body are only designed for a certain life span. The older the population, the more often treatment becomes necessary.\n\nStryker benefits as a leading medtech company: Stryker is a diversified medical device company and can be considered a \"shovel seller\" in the gold rush. The company produces artificial knee and hip joints, surgical robots, operating rooms, resuscitation devices, medical instruments and much more. In total, the company offers more than 50,000 products.\n\nThe turnover grows by 10% annually. The profit as well. The dividend will also be increased by double digits. The balance sheet is solid, the cash flow high. 30 years ago, the share was quoted at less than one USD, but the price is now at 210 USD. The share price has therefore increased more than two hundred times. That's amazing. Should we now enter the market to profit from the opportunities of the coming decades?\n\n**CHAPTER**\n\n**1. business model**\n\n**2. evaluation**\n\n**3. risks**\n\n**business model**\n\nIn 1940, Dr. Homer Stryker begins his work as a surgeon. His primitive tools are of little help in treating his patients. So he sets up a kind of \"laboratory\" in the basement of his office. There he does research on new and better tools.\n\nIf your tools don't work, make them work. If you can't make them work, make some that do work. (If your tools and instruments don't work, make them work. If they don't work, design new tools that work.\n\nStryker's first hospital bed for patients with back pain. Picture source: Stryker\n\nIn 1942 Dr. Stryker developed a hospital bed for patients with back pain. This bed allows patients to rotate without putting strain on the back. For this purpose the patient is supported from both sides. In the period after the end of the Second World War, there were many injured people who were dependent on such innovations.\n\nIn 1979 the company went public. The funds raised are used to acquire a manufacturer of implants. Since then Stryker has been producing artificial materials that are implanted into the human body. Many readers are probably familiar with implants, especially from dentistry. In dentistry, metal screws are screwed into the jawbone to form a foundation for an artificial tooth. A dental prosthesis can then be screwed onto it and instead of a gap in the tooth, the patient is given an artificial tooth that considerably improves his or her everyday life.\n\nImplants are also available in other areas of the body, e.g. artificial knee and hip joints. And these are manufactured by Stryker.\n\nIn 1994 Stryker invents the \"Rugged\" couch for the transport of emergency patients.\n\n2013 MAKO Surgical is acquired, a manufacturer of robotic arms that assist surgeons during complicated operations.\n\n2019 Stryker is already 40 years on the stock exchange. In the last 30 years alone, the share price has risen from less than USD 1 to USD 210, which is more than two hundred times the capital. As so often, the greatest success stories take place in the background. That makes this stock analysis all the more urgent. It is a matter close to my heart to be able to introduce this company to you in more detail.\n\nObviously, this company does some things right - otherwise such a performance is not possible. One of the components of success is the constantly growing demand. The company is simply in the right industry. Another component is the acquisition of competitors to grow even faster. These two factors will remain intact in the future. So the signs are good that the future will be as successful as the past.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nOver the decades, Stryker has undergone fundamental changes. From a \"low-tech\" manufacturer of simple instruments for patients and the production of hospital beds to one of the world's leading medical technology companies with in-depth know-how and genuine high-tech products.\n\nStryker's mission is to improve health and patient care worldwide. The drive of Dr. Stryker lives on in the company. All employees work to constantly develop new innovations and to continuously improve the products.\n\nIn the course of my research, I again spoke with several doctors and experts who are in daily contact with Stryker products. At this point I would like to thank you very much for this.\n\nManagement: Stryker is managed by Kevin Lobo since 2012\n\nKevin Lobo has worked for KPMG, Unilever and Kraft Canada. There he was employed in financial positions. This was followed by several years as President of Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Canada. There he came into contact with the healthcare industry.\n\nThe following video shows Lobo in action. He explains what sets Stryker apart from the competition. The competition (including Johnson &amp; Johnson) tries as hard as possible to keep costs down. This is achieved by centralizing units. A large administration, a sales team, a research unit. But with this centralized set-up, a lot is also lost. The direct contact with the customer. The responsibility and motivation of the employees.\n\nStryker has therefore chosen a different approach. The path of decentralization. Each division and division is basically a small company in its own right. With its own sales staff and its own research unit. Although this form of organization causes somewhat higher costs, it also has enormous advantages: there is hardly any bureaucracy, no long coordination processes, the employees can make decisions quickly and take responsibility for \"their\" company. All in all, this leads to faster innovation and stronger growth.\n\nSector analysis: Healthcare sector growing thanks to megatrends\n\nEven if the overall economy or the gross domestic product of a country grows by only 2% per year, there are individual sectors that are growing much faster. These include online retailing, IT services, the gaming industry, streaming providers and entertainment, the luxury segment and the health sector.\n\nOn the other hand, there are other sectors that are growing all the weaker or even shrinking. This is the case, for example, in the telecommunications or banking industry.\n\nIf you as an investor pick out the sectors that are growing strongly, you can profit particularly well from rising sales, profits and dividends.\n\nHealthcare sector with a sustained tailwind\n\nIn the various analyses of the healthcare sector (including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Intuitive Surgical, Fresenius and Siemens Healthineers) I have already mentioned the advantages of this industry.\n\n1. life expectancy is increasing, people are getting older.\n\n2. but the body is only designed for a certain life span. The older people get, the more physical limitations and treatments.\n\n3 Stryker, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Siemens Healthineers are the \"shovel sellers\" in the gold rush. They sell the instruments, robots, drugs and implants that are increasingly in demand by doctors, and thus earn money from every treatment\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\u201csickness costs by age, Germany, 2008\u201d\n\nA further advantage of the healthcare industry is that demand is independent of economic cycles. If you have hellish knee pain with every step you take, you don't want to wait two years for the next economic recovery. They want to be treated immediately.\n\nThe new \"widespread diseases\n\nIn addition to the common and frequently discussed diseases of stroke, heart attack and cancer, there are two new \"widespread diseases\" that are becoming increasingly common in an ageing society.\n\n1. arthrosis: This disease describes a particularly severe wear and tear of the joints, which exceeds the usual level for the elderly. This can be caused, for example, by overweight or inflammation of the joints. With increasing age, more and more people are affected. Many patients have pain in their knees or hips with every step they take. One way out is to replace the knee joints with artificial implants (which are manufactured by Stryker).\n\n2. osteoporosis: This condition is understood to be an excessive breakdown of the bones. These become more and more porous with increasing age. More than 6 million Germans suffer from this disease. Since the disease causes no pain, it is mostly unrecognised. If an affected person falls from a bicycle or falls down stairs, the thin bones break through quickly and the patient has to be operated. Stryker screws and products are also used in these operations to reconnect the broken bones.\n\nIt is already quite clear that the treatment of these two diseases increases massively with increasing life expectancy. No matter how strong or weak the overall economy grows, the healthcare industry will hardly complain about a lack of demand in the future.\n\nFrom an investor's perspective, the exciting consideration is that it is already possible to participate in the clear beneficiaries of these developments through targeted investments. In this way one will profit from demographic change in the coming years and decades.\n\nIndustry analysis according to Porter \n\nAt this point we will now introduce a recurring format. The Porter industry analysis.\n\nFor many decades, US Professor Michael Porter has been concerned with the idea of competition. His conviction is: Profitable companies fulfill customer wishes without wasting unnecessary resources.\n\nPorter believes that the performance of a company is the result of two factors:\n\n1. industry performance: The Five Forces, which explain all the differences in profitability between different industries\n\n2. company performance: the strategy of a company, which explains its relative profitability compared to the industry/branches\n\nNote: The more points we award in the \"Strength\" column, the more intense the competition is. 1 point means no competition, 10 points means maximum competition.\n\nCompetitive strength Assessment Strength\n\nExisting competition Depending on the product there are more or less competitors. In general, the medical technology market is characterized by a few large suppliers. Patents and high research expenditures secure the market position of the individual suppliers. 7/10\n\nPotential competition The approval of new products is a very complex and complicated process. Therefore, small and innovative companies can typically be bought up before submitting a product for approval and marketing worldwide. This shields the large companies. 3/10\n\nReplacement products If a knee or hip is broken, this part of the body is broken. Nowadays, old people also want to live an active life. This means that from time to time medical interventions become necessary. Theoretically, however, new drugs could prevent diseases from breaking out in the first place and thus make surgery or the insertion of implants unnecessary. However, this is far into the future and we should not forget that Stryker has a wide range of products. 4/10\n\nMakes the supplier low. The products are manufactured in-house. 1/10\n\nMakes the buyer rather low. Doctors and hospitals can only choose between a few suppliers. 3/10\n\nConclusion on the sector analysis: attractive market \n\nCompetitive forces are under control. There are only a few suppliers in the medical technology market, including Johnson &amp; Johnson and Siemens Healthineers.\n\nMany products require a longer training period. Once a doctor has become accustomed to a certain surgical procedure and achieves good results, he remains a loyal customer. Competitor products may be processed differently and the quality of the treatment cannot be guaranteed. In case of doubt: \"Never change a running system\". This lock-in effect provides additional security for the industry.\n\nNo wonder that all major suppliers work with consistently high profit margins.\n\nStryker's strategy: achieve market leadership\n\nStryker aims for a #1 or #2 position in all segments. Market leadership is achieved through both in-house research &amp; development and acquisitions. In this way Stryker is building up an ever larger customer base in an ever growing market.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nBusiness model explained clearly\n\nStryker is a highly innovative and worldwide leading medical technology company. The company's mission is to improve healthcare. Stryker is very well diversified, selling a total of over 50,000 different products.\n\nSales are generated in the following regions:\n\nNorth America 72%\n\nEurope, Middle East, Africa 13%\n\nAsia 11% Asia\n\nRemaining 4% of\n\nStryker is not yet really internationally active, but is very strongly represented in the USA. In the long term, international expansion will create an additional growth opportunity. The company has divided its business into 3 divisions, which I will introduce shortly. Before I do, let's take a look at the company's growth drivers:\n\nStryker is growing faster than the market.\n\n1. market growth 4% p.a: First and foremost, the attractive industry growth of approx. 4% p.a. This growth is due to increasing life expectancy.\n\n2. Stryker gains market share - 6% p.a. Stryker, however, succeeds in increasing sales by approx. 6% under its own steam. The company thus gains market share. The reason for this is the decentralised structure of the company, which consists of a large number of own and small companies. The resulting proximity to customers and responsibility of the employees ensures an increasing market share.\n\n  \n\n\ud83d\udcf73. Stryker takes over competitors 8-10% p.a: Stryker operates at a profit margin of over 25%. The dividend payout ratio is only about 30% of profit. After the dividend payment, a high profit and a high cash flow remain in the company. Stryker uses these funds to continuously acquire competing companies. All in all, the acquisitions are also very successful. There are several reasons for this: First, you know the business. Secondly, the decentralized structure ensures that newly acquired companies hardly need to be integrated at all. They are allowed to develop independently.\n\nStryker pursues a clear growth strategy: the dividend yield is paltry at just over 1%. So is the payout ratio. Stryker's goal is to grow as strongly as possible. In all markets, the company wants to reach the #1 or #2 position.\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIn the market for ankle joints and foot implants, Stryker achieved a market share of 22% in 2017. In 2019 it was announced that it would take over its competitor Wright. From 2020, the market share will rise to almost 50%. Stryker's market position is constantly improving. Picture source: Stryker\n\nDistribution of sales by division\n\nNow it's time to show you exactly what Stryker does for a living. One thing in advance: With more than 50,000 products, the company is now really enormously broad-based. Many of the products are so special that non-medical people have never heard of them. Nevertheless, I will do my best to give you an understandable and comprehensive overview of the company's business activities.\n\nStryker divides its business into 3 divisions:\n\n1. Neurotechnology &amp; Spine (brown, 17% share of sales)\n\n2. orthopaedics (purple, 38% share of sales)\n\n3. MedSurg (green, 45% share of sales)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Each of the three divisions consists of individual product groups. In total, no single product group is responsible for more than 16% of sales.\n\n1. neurotechnology &amp; spine (17% share of sales; brain &amp; back)\n\nStrokes: Stryker manufactures products that can save lives in the event of a stroke. These include, for example, highly innovative catheters that can be passed through the patient's bloodstream and reach the obstructed bloodstream. There they can remove the blood clot that is blocking the bloodstream, allowing the blood to circulate freely again.\n\nBack/spine: Stryker manufactures screws, implants and instruments used in back surgery. As we sit more and more, herniated discs continue to increase.\n\nSkull: The company offers instruments for sawing open the bone, as well as cement and fasteners for subsequent sealing of the skull after surgery.\n\n2. orthopaedics (38% of sales; products of the musculoskeletal system) \n\nKnee: Stryker offers implants that can be used as artificial joints in surgery for broken/worn knees, allowing patients to return to natural movement without pain.\n\nHip: Implants are also available for the hip.\n\nextremities: Stryker products are also used in shoulder operations, ankle operations, etc. These can be implants, screws or even plates.\n\nMAKO robots: A special highlight in the portfolio are the MAKO robots. The robots enable extremely precise and reliable operations on knees and hips. Using CT images taken in advance, the robot can identify with millimetre precision where the artificial knee or hip joints need to be inserted. The doctor only has to control a joystick and can see the operation on the screen. The rest is done by the MAKO robot. The following 3-minute video shows the robot in action:\n\n3. MedSurg (45% share of sales; equipment)\n\nInstruments: These include various types of drills, cameras, saws, etc. for efficient and precise surgery on patients. Stryker manufactures more or less almost all \"tools\" of the surgeons.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Endoscopes: These include highly innovative cameras that are used in minimally invasive operations. Instead of cutting open the entire abdomen to perform an operation, as was previously the case, a few small holes are now sufficient. The instruments are pushed through these holes into the abdomen, and the doctor in charge never loses track of what is happening, because the endoscopes provide him with a view into the interior of the abdomen.\n\nMedical devices: This includes Stryker equipment for the resuscitation of people, highly specialized couches &amp; stretchers, as well as offering entire operating rooms with tables, screens, lamps, etc.\n\nConclusion on the business model: Stryker has an extremely broad base\n\nThis brief overview of the company's business activities shows that Stryker is enormously broad-based. A particularly positive aspect is that all major product groups are growing at a similar pace. This means that growth is not dependent on single/few products, but takes place throughout the entire company.\n\nAs long as you are not working in a hospital or being admitted there as a patient, you hardly notice Stryker's products. Yet they are essential for survival. Just think of the following case: After a fall from the stairs, a patient has severe pain and can hardly move. Consequently, he calls the ambulance. where he is loaded onto a cot belonging to Stryker. If his pulse would stop, Stryker's ventilators would be ready at any time. Arriving at the hospital, an examination reveals that the patient has broken his hip. They use Stryker surgical instruments, screws and plates. Stryker also offers the operating table with lights and screens.\n\nThis fictitious case shows how broadly the company is positioned. Apart from the financial logic of this investment, what I like so much about it is that an investment also feels good morally. Thanks to Stryker's efforts, doctors can achieve ever better results. We already know that the industry is growing strongly and that competitive pressure is under control. The past performance of the share is also convincing. But should we still buy the stock now? Time for the second chapter of this stock analysis, in which we look at the valuation of the Stryker share.\n\n**evaluation**\n\n1. industry grows by approx. 4% p.a.\n\n2. due to market share gains Stryker achieves a sales growth of approx. 6% p.a. by its own efforts (organic sales growth)\n\n3. acquisitions increase sales growth to 8-10% p.a.\n\nStryker has been able to grow faster than the medical technology industry for years. That's a very good performance.\n\nThe profit development is similarly convincing. In 2013/2014 there were two years with less profit. The reason for this is that a few products were voluntarily recalled and customers were reimbursed for the purchase price. In the core/without this special effect, profits would have continued to develop positively.\n\nThe profit margin is over 25% - a lot of money is earned in this industry. From 2011 onwards, the company's profit margin has fallen somewhat. The reason for this is that the numerous acquisitions generate costs (consulting, integration, financing, etc.). In the core business and adjusted for such expenses, the profit margin is above 25% - and rising.\n\nEarnings per share are also developing very well, with double-digit annual growth. The tax cut in the USA has triggered a one-off additional boost. The decline in profits in 2013/2014 is due to the recall of individual products.\n\nStryker is increasing the dividend at a double-digit rate. In 2009 the dividend was reduced and management switched from an annual to a quarterly payment. Over the past 10 years, the dividend has been increased every year.\n\nThe dividend yield is currently only 1.1% - a measly figure. This compares to a growth rate of at least 10% per year - which corresponds to a doubling of the dividend every 7 years. After 14 years, investors would thus already receive four times the dividend, after 21 years eight times the dividend.\n\nThe low dividend yield is also a result of the low payout ratio of about 30%. The company deliberately wants to retain a large part of the profit in order to be able to acquire further companies. Stryker is currently a growth stock and not a stock with immediate high cash flow for shareholders.\n\nView of the balance sheet\n\nAt the end of 2018, Stryker has USD 6.2 billion in debt, which corresponds to 2.4 times annual profit. All figures up to 4 times annual profit are generally considered solid. As the development of sales and profits is particularly stable and reliable, the balance sheet appears very solid.\n\nUse of free cash flow\n\nStryker currently generates a free cash flow of approximately USD 3 billion/year. Approximately USD 800 million of this will be required for the payment of the dividend. This leaves USD 2.2 billion. This amount will be used to acquire competitors to stimulate growth.\n\nIf no suitable takeover targets are found, Stryker buys back its own shares. However, this happens on a rather small scale.\n\nStryker is between an average grower share and a fast grower share. This type of share can generate a very attractive return in the long term. If the growth prospects are intact, this type of share can be bought if the valuation is roughly in line with the historical average of recent years.\n\nCurrently Stryker shares are valued at 19 times operating profit (read like the P/E ratio, the lower the better). This value is even slightly lower than the average of the last 7 years from 2013 onwards.\n\nThe Stryker share is valued at 5 times turnover, which is about 25% more than the average of the last 7 years. This is also due to the tax cut in the USA. Since then a larger part of the pre-tax profit remains as net profit. This makes the companies more valuable.\n\nA continuously strongly growing stock like Stryker almost always has a high P/E ratio. This is perfectly acceptable, because the P/E ratio only indicates the ratio of the share price to current earnings. However, shareholders are not only entitled to the profit of the current year, but also the profit to infinity.\n\nStryker's P/E ratio for 2021 is 23. Assuming an annual profit growth of 10%, the P/E ratios are as follows:\n\nPeriod P/E ratio\n\nin 1 year (2021) 23\n\nin 8 years (2028) 11.5\n\nin 15 years (2035) 5.75\n\nIn relation to the profit in 8 years, the P/E ratio is \"only\" 11.5, in relation to the profit in 15 years it is only 5.75. Therefore, the following applies: The stronger the profit growth of a company, the higher the current P/E ratio may be. A valuation with the 23-fold P/E ratio appears to be quite fair in the view from the year 2000 onwards. Of course, the share was cheaper for a few years, but at that time the financial crisis caused particularly severe distortions.\n\n4th IRR model\n\nIn the long term, we achieve our return to shareholders from two factors: the dividend yield and the increase in the share price. I calculate the long-term return expectation of the Stryker share using the IRR model: This model assumes a constant valuation and is very well suited to determine the expected return over a very long holding period.\n\nReturn parameters Return\n\n1. sustainable, organic profit growth of approx. 6% per year\n\n2. free cash flow yield approx. 3.5\n\nTotal approx. 9.5%\n\nAs always, I would like to explain my assumptions to you so that you can understand my calculations.\n\n1. Stryker increases sales by 6% per annum on its own account since 2012. This is in addition to an increase in the profit margin, which I will leave out in the future. I'd rather be conservative and cautious in my calculations. Stryker has been growing at 6% per annum since its IPO in 1979 and, given the intact megatrends (rising life expectancy, development of healthcare in emerging countries, etc.), I am confident that the company will be able to maintain this growth.\n\n2. Stryker's free cash flow yield is approximately 3.5% for 2020 and 4.0% for 2021. Of this, a dividend yield of approximately 1.1% will be paid out, with the remainder of the profit being used to make acquisitions. As a result of the acquisitions, sales and profit will grow by almost 10% annually.\n\nThis brings us to a total long-term annual return expectation of about 9.5%. \n\nThis is a return expectation that is almost exactly in line with the long-term average for the broad stock market (the S&amp;P 500 index has risen by exactly 10% per year over the last 100 years). At the same time, an investment in Stryker is associated with particularly low risks (non-cyclical business model, profit even in crises, more than 50,000 products...). Therefore the risk/reward ratio is much better than that of an investment in the broad market. Therefore, the Stryker share is worth buying for me.\n\n5. expected return depending on the entry price and investment strategy\n\nExpected return Initial price\n\napprox. 8% p.a. USD 368\n\napprox. 8.5% p.a. USD 294\n\napprox. 9% p.a. USD 245\n\napprox. 9.5% p.a. 210 USD\n\napprox. 10% p.a. USD 184\n\napprox. 10.5% p.a. USD 163\n\napprox. 11% p.a.

This leads to rising healthcare costs. Knees, hips and other parts of the body are only designed for a certain life span. The older the population, the more often treatment becomes necessary.\n\nStryker benefits as a leading medtech company: Stryker is a diversified medical device company and can be considered a \"shovel seller\" in the gold rush. The company produces artificial knee and hip joints, surgical robots, operating rooms, resuscitation devices, medical instruments and much more. In total, the company offers more than 50,000 products.\n\nThe turnover grows by 10% annually. The profit as well. The dividend will also be increased by double digits. The balance sheet is solid, the cash flow high. 30 years ago, the share was quoted at less than one USD, but the price is now at 210 USD. The share price has therefore increased more than two hundred times. That's amazing. Should we now enter the market to profit from the opportunities of the coming decades?\n\n**CHAPTER**\n\n**1. business model**\n\n**2. evaluation**\n\n**3. risks**\n\n**business model**\n\nIn 1940, Dr. Homer Stryker begins his work as a surgeon. His primitive tools are of little help in treating his patients. So he sets up a kind of \"laboratory\" in the basement of his office. There he does research on new and better tools.\n\nIf your tools don't work, make them work. If you can't make them work, make some that do work. (If your tools and instruments don't work, make them work. If they don't work, design new tools that work.\n\nStryker's first hospital bed for patients with back pain. Picture source: Stryker\n\nIn 1942 Dr. Stryker developed a hospital bed for patients with back pain. This bed allows patients to rotate without putting strain on the back. For this purpose the patient is supported from both sides. In the period after the end of the Second World War, there were many injured people who were dependent on such innovations.\n\nIn 1979 the company went public. The funds raised are used to acquire a manufacturer of implants. Since then Stryker has been producing artificial materials that are implanted into the human body. Many readers are probably familiar with implants, especially from dentistry. In dentistry, metal screws are screwed into the jawbone to form a foundation for an artificial tooth. A dental prosthesis can then be screwed onto it and instead of a gap in the tooth, the patient is given an artificial tooth that considerably improves his or her everyday life.\n\nImplants are also available in other areas of the body, e.g. artificial knee and hip joints. And these are manufactured by Stryker.\n\nIn 1994 Stryker invents the \"Rugged\" couch for the transport of emergency patients.\n\n2013 MAKO Surgical is acquired, a manufacturer of robotic arms that assist surgeons during complicated operations.\n\n2019 Stryker is already 40 years on the stock exchange. In the last 30 years alone, the share price has risen from less than USD 1 to USD 210, which is more than two hundred times the capital. As so often, the greatest success stories take place in the background. That makes this stock analysis all the more urgent. It is a matter close to my heart to be able to introduce this company to you in more detail.\n\nObviously, this company does some things right - otherwise such a performance is not possible. One of the components of success is the constantly growing demand. The company is simply in the right industry. Another component is the acquisition of competitors to grow even faster. These two factors will remain intact in the future. So the signs are good that the future will be as successful as the past.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nOver the decades, Stryker has undergone fundamental changes. From a \"low-tech\" manufacturer of simple instruments for patients and the production of hospital beds to one of the world's leading medical technology companies with in-depth know-how and genuine high-tech products.\n\nStryker's mission is to improve health and patient care worldwide. The drive of Dr. Stryker lives on in the company. All employees work to constantly develop new innovations and to continuously improve the products.\n\nIn the course of my research, I again spoke with several doctors and experts who are in daily contact with Stryker products. At this point I would like to thank you very much for this.\n\nManagement: Stryker is managed by Kevin Lobo since 2012\n\nKevin Lobo has worked for KPMG, Unilever and Kraft Canada. There he was employed in financial positions. This was followed by several years as President of Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Canada. There he came into contact with the healthcare industry.\n\nThe following video shows Lobo in action. He explains what sets Stryker apart from the competition. The competition (including Johnson &amp; Johnson) tries as hard as possible to keep costs down. This is achieved by centralizing units. A large administration, a sales team, a research unit. But with this centralized set-up, a lot is also lost. The direct contact with the customer. The responsibility and motivation of the employees.\n\nStryker has therefore chosen a different approach. The path of decentralization. Each division and division is basically a small company in its own right. With its own sales staff and its own research unit. Although this form of organization causes somewhat higher costs, it also has enormous advantages: there is hardly any bureaucracy, no long coordination processes, the employees can make decisions quickly and take responsibility for \"their\" company. All in all, this leads to faster innovation and stronger growth.\n\nSector analysis: Healthcare sector growing thanks to megatrends\n\nEven if the overall economy or the gross domestic product of a country grows by only 2% per year, there are individual sectors that are growing much faster. These include online retailing, IT services, the gaming industry, streaming providers and entertainment, the luxury segment and the health sector.\n\nOn the other hand, there are other sectors that are growing all the weaker or even shrinking. This is the case, for example, in the telecommunications or banking industry.\n\nIf you as an investor pick out the sectors that are growing strongly, you can profit particularly well from rising sales, profits and dividends.\n\nHealthcare sector with a sustained tailwind\n\nIn the various analyses of the healthcare sector (including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Intuitive Surgical, Fresenius and Siemens Healthineers) I have already mentioned the advantages of this industry.\n\n1. life expectancy is increasing, people are getting older.\n\n2. but the body is only designed for a certain life span. The older people get, the more physical limitations and treatments.\n\n3 Stryker, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Siemens Healthineers are the \"shovel sellers\" in the gold rush. They sell the instruments, robots, drugs and implants that are increasingly in demand by doctors, and thus earn money from every treatment\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\u201csickness costs by age, Germany, 2008\u201d\n\nA further advantage of the healthcare industry is that demand is independent of economic cycles. If you have hellish knee pain with every step you take, you don't want to wait two years for the next economic recovery. They want to be treated immediately.\n\nThe new \"widespread diseases\n\nIn addition to the common and frequently discussed diseases of stroke, heart attack and cancer, there are two new \"widespread diseases\" that are becoming increasingly common in an ageing society.\n\n1. arthrosis: This disease describes a particularly severe wear and tear of the joints, which exceeds the usual level for the elderly. This can be caused, for example, by overweight or inflammation of the joints. With increasing age, more and more people are affected. Many patients have pain in their knees or hips with every step they take. One way out is to replace the knee joints with artificial implants (which are manufactured by Stryker).\n\n2. osteoporosis: This condition is understood to be an excessive breakdown of the bones. These become more and more porous with increasing age. More than 6 million Germans suffer from this disease. Since the disease causes no pain, it is mostly unrecognised. If an affected person falls from a bicycle or falls down stairs, the thin bones break through quickly and the patient has to be operated. Stryker screws and products are also used in these operations to reconnect the broken bones.\n\nIt is already quite clear that the treatment of these two diseases increases massively with increasing life expectancy. No matter how strong or weak the overall economy grows, the healthcare industry will hardly complain about a lack of demand in the future.\n\nFrom an investor's perspective, the exciting consideration is that it is already possible to participate in the clear beneficiaries of these developments through targeted investments. In this way one will profit from demographic change in the coming years and decades.\n\nIndustry analysis according to Porter \n\nAt this point we will now introduce a recurring format. The Porter industry analysis.\n\nFor many decades, US Professor Michael Porter has been concerned with the idea of competition. His conviction is: Profitable companies fulfill customer wishes without wasting unnecessary resources.\n\nPorter believes that the performance of a company is the result of two factors:\n\n1. industry performance: The Five Forces, which explain all the differences in profitability between different industries\n\n2. company performance: the strategy of a company, which explains its relative profitability compared to the industry/branches\n\nNote: The more points we award in the \"Strength\" column, the more intense the competition is. 1 point means no competition, 10 points means maximum competition.\n\nCompetitive strength Assessment Strength\n\nExisting competition Depending on the product there are more or less competitors. In general, the medical technology market is characterized by a few large suppliers. Patents and high research expenditures secure the market position of the individual suppliers. 7/10\n\nPotential competition The approval of new products is a very complex and complicated process. Therefore, small and innovative companies can typically be bought up before submitting a product for approval and marketing worldwide. This shields the large companies. 3/10\n\nReplacement products If a knee or hip is broken, this part of the body is broken. Nowadays, old people also want to live an active life. This means that from time to time medical interventions become necessary. Theoretically, however, new drugs could prevent diseases from breaking out in the first place and thus make surgery or the insertion of implants unnecessary. However, this is far into the future and we should not forget that Stryker has a wide range of products. 4/10\n\nMakes the supplier low. The products are manufactured in-house. 1/10\n\nMakes the buyer rather low. Doctors and hospitals can only choose between a few suppliers. 3/10\n\nConclusion on the sector analysis: attractive market \n\nCompetitive forces are under control. There are only a few suppliers in the medical technology market, including Johnson &amp; Johnson and Siemens Healthineers.\n\nMany products require a longer training period. Once a doctor has become accustomed to a certain surgical procedure and achieves good results, he remains a loyal customer. Competitor products may be processed differently and the quality of the treatment cannot be guaranteed. In case of doubt: \"Never change a running system\". This lock-in effect provides additional security for the industry.\n\nNo wonder that all major suppliers work with consistently high profit margins.\n\nStryker's strategy: achieve market leadership\n\nStryker aims for a #1 or #2 position in all segments. Market leadership is achieved through both in-house research &amp; development and acquisitions. In this way Stryker is building up an ever larger customer base in an ever growing market.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nBusiness model explained clearly\n\nStryker is a highly innovative and worldwide leading medical technology company. The company's mission is to improve healthcare. Stryker is very well diversified, selling a total of over 50,000 different products.\n\nSales are generated in the following regions:\n\nNorth America 72%\n\nEurope, Middle East, Africa 13%\n\nAsia 11% Asia\n\nRemaining 4% of\n\nStryker is not yet really internationally active, but is very strongly represented in the USA. In the long term, international expansion will create an additional growth opportunity. The company has divided its business into 3 divisions, which I will introduce shortly. Before I do, let's take a look at the company's growth drivers:\n\nStryker is growing faster than the market.\n\n1. market growth 4% p.a: First and foremost, the attractive industry growth of approx. 4% p.a. This growth is due to increasing life expectancy.\n\n2. Stryker gains market share - 6% p.a. Stryker, however, succeeds in increasing sales by approx. 6% under its own steam. The company thus gains market share. The reason for this is the decentralised structure of the company, which consists of a large number of own and small companies. The resulting proximity to customers and responsibility of the employees ensures an increasing market share.\n\n  \n\n\ud83d\udcf73. Stryker takes over competitors 8-10% p.a: Stryker operates at a profit margin of over 25%. The dividend payout ratio is only about 30% of profit. After the dividend payment, a high profit and a high cash flow remain in the company. Stryker uses these funds to continuously acquire competing companies. All in all, the acquisitions are also very successful. There are several reasons for this: First, you know the business. Secondly, the decentralized structure ensures that newly acquired companies hardly need to be integrated at all. They are allowed to develop independently.\n\nStryker pursues a clear growth strategy: the dividend yield is paltry at just over 1%. So is the payout ratio. Stryker's goal is to grow as strongly as possible. In all markets, the company wants to reach the #1 or #2 position.\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIn the market for ankle joints and foot implants, Stryker achieved a market share of 22% in 2017. In 2019 it was announced that it would take over its competitor Wright. From 2020, the market share will rise to almost 50%. Stryker's market position is constantly improving. Picture source: Stryker\n\nDistribution of sales by division\n\nNow it's time to show you exactly what Stryker does for a living. One thing in advance: With more than 50,000 products, the company is now really enormously broad-based. Many of the products are so special that non-medical people have never heard of them. Nevertheless, I will do my best to give you an understandable and comprehensive overview of the company's business activities.\n\nStryker divides its business into 3 divisions:\n\n1. Neurotechnology &amp; Spine (brown, 17% share of sales)\n\n2. orthopaedics (purple, 38% share of sales)\n\n3. MedSurg (green, 45% share of sales)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Each of the three divisions consists of individual product groups. In total, no single product group is responsible for more than 16% of sales.\n\n1. neurotechnology &amp; spine (17% share of sales; brain &amp; back)\n\nStrokes: Stryker manufactures products that can save lives in the event of a stroke. These include, for example, highly innovative catheters that can be passed through the patient's bloodstream and reach the obstructed bloodstream. There they can remove the blood clot that is blocking the bloodstream, allowing the blood to circulate freely again.\n\nBack/spine: Stryker manufactures screws, implants and instruments used in back surgery. As we sit more and more, herniated discs continue to increase.\n\nSkull: The company offers instruments for sawing open the bone, as well as cement and fasteners for subsequent sealing of the skull after surgery.\n\n2. orthopaedics (38% of sales; products of the musculoskeletal system) \n\nKnee: Stryker offers implants that can be used as artificial joints in surgery for broken/worn knees, allowing patients to return to natural movement without pain.\n\nHip: Implants are also available for the hip.\n\nextremities: Stryker products are also used in shoulder operations, ankle operations, etc. These can be implants, screws or even plates.\n\nMAKO robots: A special highlight in the portfolio are the MAKO robots. The robots enable extremely precise and reliable operations on knees and hips. Using CT images taken in advance, the robot can identify with millimetre precision where the artificial knee or hip joints need to be inserted. The doctor only has to control a joystick and can see the operation on the screen. The rest is done by the MAKO robot. The following 3-minute video shows the robot in action:\n\n3. MedSurg (45% share of sales; equipment)\n\nInstruments: These include various types of drills, cameras, saws, etc. for efficient and precise surgery on patients. Stryker manufactures more or less almost all \"tools\" of the surgeons.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Endoscopes: These include highly innovative cameras that are used in minimally invasive operations. Instead of cutting open the entire abdomen to perform an operation, as was previously the case, a few small holes are now sufficient. The instruments are pushed through these holes into the abdomen, and the doctor in charge never loses track of what is happening, because the endoscopes provide him with a view into the interior of the abdomen.\n\nMedical devices: This includes Stryker equipment for the resuscitation of people, highly specialized couches &amp; stretchers, as well as offering entire operating rooms with tables, screens, lamps, etc.\n\nConclusion on the business model: Stryker has an extremely broad base\n\nThis brief overview of the company's business activities shows that Stryker is enormously broad-based. A particularly positive aspect is that all major product groups are growing at a similar pace. This means that growth is not dependent on single/few products, but takes place throughout the entire company.\n\nAs long as you are not working in a hospital or being admitted there as a patient, you hardly notice Stryker's products. Yet they are essential for survival. Just think of the following case: After a fall from the stairs, a patient has severe pain and can hardly move. Consequently, he calls the ambulance. where he is loaded onto a cot belonging to Stryker. If his pulse would stop, Stryker's ventilators would be ready at any time. Arriving at the hospital, an examination reveals that the patient has broken his hip. They use Stryker surgical instruments, screws and plates. Stryker also offers the operating table with lights and screens.\n\nThis fictitious case shows how broadly the company is positioned. Apart from the financial logic of this investment, what I like so much about it is that an investment also feels good morally. Thanks to Stryker's efforts, doctors can achieve ever better results. We already know that the industry is growing strongly and that competitive pressure is under control. The past performance of the share is also convincing. But should we still buy the stock now? Time for the second chapter of this stock analysis, in which we look at the valuation of the Stryker share.\n\n**evaluation**\n\n1. industry grows by approx. 4% p.a.\n\n2. due to market share gains Stryker achieves a sales growth of approx. 6% p.a. by its own efforts (organic sales growth)\n\n3. acquisitions increase sales growth to 8-10% p.a.\n\nStryker has been able to grow faster than the medical technology industry for years. That's a very good performance.\n\nThe profit development is similarly convincing. In 2013/2014 there were two years with less profit. The reason for this is that a few products were voluntarily recalled and customers were reimbursed for the purchase price. In the core/without this special effect, profits would have continued to develop positively.\n\nThe profit margin is over 25% - a lot of money is earned in this industry. From 2011 onwards, the company's profit margin has fallen somewhat. The reason for this is that the numerous acquisitions generate costs (consulting, integration, financing, etc.). In the core business and adjusted for such expenses, the profit margin is above 25% - and rising.\n\nEarnings per share are also developing very well, with double-digit annual growth. The tax cut in the USA has triggered a one-off additional boost. The decline in profits in 2013/2014 is due to the recall of individual products.\n\nStryker is increasing the dividend at a double-digit rate. In 2009 the dividend was reduced and management switched from an annual to a quarterly payment. Over the past 10 years, the dividend has been increased every year.\n\nThe dividend yield is currently only 1.1% - a measly figure. This compares to a growth rate of at least 10% per year - which corresponds to a doubling of the dividend every 7 years. After 14 years, investors would thus already receive four times the dividend, after 21 years eight times the dividend.\n\nThe low dividend yield is also a result of the low payout ratio of about 30%. The company deliberately wants to retain a large part of the profit in order to be able to acquire further companies. Stryker is currently a growth stock and not a stock with immediate high cash flow for shareholders.\n\nView of the balance sheet\n\nAt the end of 2018, Stryker has USD 6.2 billion in debt, which corresponds to 2.4 times annual profit. All figures up to 4 times annual profit are generally considered solid. As the development of sales and profits is particularly stable and reliable, the balance sheet appears very solid.\n\nUse of free cash flow\n\nStryker currently generates a free cash flow of approximately USD 3 billion/year. Approximately USD 800 million of this will be required for the payment of the dividend. This leaves USD 2.2 billion. This amount will be used to acquire competitors to stimulate growth.\n\nIf no suitable takeover targets are found, Stryker buys back its own shares. However, this happens on a rather small scale.\n\nStryker is between an average grower share and a fast grower share. This type of share can generate a very attractive return in the long term. If the growth prospects are intact, this type of share can be bought if the valuation is roughly in line with the historical average of recent years.\n\nCurrently Stryker shares are valued at 19 times operating profit (read like the P/E ratio, the lower the better). This value is even slightly lower than the average of the last 7 years from 2013 onwards.\n\nThe Stryker share is valued at 5 times turnover, which is about 25% more than the average of the last 7 years. This is also due to the tax cut in the USA. Since then a larger part of the pre-tax profit remains as net profit. This makes the companies more valuable.\n\nA continuously strongly growing stock like Stryker almost always has a high P/E ratio. This is perfectly acceptable, because the P/E ratio only indicates the ratio of the share price to current earnings. However, shareholders are not only entitled to the profit of the current year, but also the profit to infinity.\n\nStryker's P/E ratio for 2021 is 23. Assuming an annual profit growth of 10%, the P/E ratios are as follows:\n\nPeriod P/E ratio\n\nin 1 year (2021) 23\n\nin 8 years (2028) 11.5\n\nin 15 years (2035) 5.75\n\nIn relation to the profit in 8 years, the P/E ratio is \"only\" 11.5, in relation to the profit in 15 years it is only 5.75. Therefore, the following applies: The stronger the profit growth of a company, the higher the current P/E ratio may be. A valuation with the 23-fold P/E ratio appears to be quite fair in the view from the year 2000 onwards. Of course, the share was cheaper for a few years, but at that time the financial crisis caused particularly severe distortions.\n\n4th IRR model\n\nIn the long term, we achieve our return to shareholders from two factors: the dividend yield and the increase in the share price. I calculate the long-term return expectation of the Stryker share using the IRR model: This model assumes a constant valuation and is very well suited to determine the expected return over a very long holding period.\n\nReturn parameters Return\n\n1. sustainable, organic profit growth of approx. 6% per year\n\n2. free cash flow yield approx. 3.5\n\nTotal approx. 9.5%\n\nAs always, I would like to explain my assumptions to you so that you can understand my calculations.\n\n1. Stryker increases sales by 6% per annum on its own account since 2012. This is in addition to an increase in the profit margin, which I will leave out in the future. I'd rather be conservative and cautious in my calculations. Stryker has been growing at 6% per annum since its IPO in 1979 and, given the intact megatrends (rising life expectancy, development of healthcare in emerging countries, etc.), I am confident that the company will be able to maintain this growth.\n\n2. Stryker's free cash flow yield is approximately 3.5% for 2020 and 4.0% for 2021. Of this, a dividend yield of approximately 1.1% will be paid out, with the remainder of the profit being used to make acquisitions. As a result of the acquisitions, sales and profit will grow by almost 10% annually.\n\nThis brings us to a total long-term annual return expectation of about 9.5%. \n\nThis is a return expectation that is almost exactly in line with the long-term average for the broad stock market (the S&amp;P 500 index has risen by exactly 10% per year over the last 100 years). At the same time, an investment in Stryker is associated with particularly low risks (non-cyclical business model, profit even in crises, more than 50,000 products...). Therefore the risk/reward ratio is much better than that of an investment in the broad market. Therefore, the Stryker share is worth buying for me.\n\n5. expected return depending on the entry price and investment strategy\n\nExpected return Initial price\n\napprox. 8% p.a.

They have the largest dispensary in the \\*world\\* conveniently located by the Las Vegas strip. Has both medical and recreational licenses. The dispensary is 16,200 sqft and is part of a large 112,000 sqft entertainment complet. It was voted the #1 Mary-J dispensary in Las Vegas. It does 9% of the total sales of cannabis in the state of Nevada. Regarding its name, the number 13 represents the 13th letter of the alphabet M, for marijuana.\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about it?:\n\nI believe the Planet 13 is poised to become a market leader in the emerging market of cannabis. Planet 13 is a vertically integrated, meaning it owns its own its own supply chain (cultivating, processing and dispensing.) Investor presentations indicate an emphasis on the \\*experience\\* over products, this is evidenced by their expansive dispensary complex which has interactive stops, coffee shop, restaurants, and event space. In other words, Planet 13 has made its store a must go destination in LV. Think of it as a Disneyland for potheads.\n\nProducts: Outside of simple pot they also sell cannabis vaping products, candies/gummies/chocolates. They also sell planet 13 merch.\n\nNumbers:\n\n\\-Total market cap of $200 million\n\n\\-In store and delivery sales of $63 Million in 2019\n\n\\-Q1 of 2020, a traditionally slow season, was up 20% from Q1 2019\n\n\\-At this time the company remains unprofitable. Net loss in 2019 was about $2.6 million and the company has about $12 million in net cash on hand. However I do expect this to change rapidly over the coming year as they expand their brand into other cities.\n\nAdvantages/Tailwinds:\n\n\\-As stated above, the dispensary is vertically integrated, meaning it owns its own supply chain. However they do sell other products from 3rd parties and these companies want to be on their shelves\n\n\\-It\u2019s the closest dispensary to the strip, just a few minutes taxi ride or walk away. Las Vegas is a premier tourist destination, and \\*the\\* destination to go to for any number of debaucherous delights\n\n\\-Recently acquired Newtonian Principles, a dispensary in Santa Ana, California. Along with the company is a cannabis sales license for California. ([https://planet13holdings.mediaroom.com/2020-05-21-Planet-13-Announces-Acquisition-of-California-Dispensary-License-and-Close-of-Santa-Ana-Acquisition](https://planet13holdings.mediaroom.com/2020-05-21-Planet-13-Announces-Acquisition-of-California-Dispensary-License-and-Close-of-Santa-Ana-Acquisition))\n\n\\-Recently expanded fleet of delivery cares for the Las Vegas Valley area from 5 to 29 vehicles running 24/7\n\n\\-Scalable model \u2013 plans are for expansion in large US cities. As noted above, California is the next target of expansion. The CEO has basically said if the city can support a major sports team they would like to expand there.\n\nDisadvantages/Headwinds:\n\n\\-Before the COVID19 pandemic, 80% of customer base were from people who live outside of LV. They\u2019ve mostly turned to local sales since the shutdown. The demand remains high and they\u2019ve been able to keep most of their staff, a great sign.\n\n\\-Analysts downgraded forecast for the company in light of COVID19 effect on the company. Earnings expectations for 2020 are about $50 million, about 21% decline. This is however not reflected in stock prices which have proceeded to increase from a low of about $0.70, to about $1.20 today. The previously, analyst had forecasted revenue of $93 million. Obviously COVID19 is dramatically affecting business, as is the case with the general market.\n\n\\-Legalization is a big question mark. Currently marijuana is legal in only 11 states for adults over the age of 21, and legal for medical use for 33 states.\n\nConclusion:\n\nPlanet 13 is a rapidly growing company that has the promise of becoming a premier destination for marijuana by providing a unique experience designed to draw customers and itself become an attraction in any given city.

They have the largest dispensary in the \\*world\\* conveniently located by the Las Vegas strip. Has both medical and recreational licenses. The dispensary is 16,200 sqft and is part of a large 112,000 sqft entertainment complet. It was voted the #1 Mary-J dispensary in Las Vegas. It does 9% of the total sales of cannabis in the state of Nevada. Regarding its name, the number 13 represents the 13th letter of the alphabet M, for marijuana. \n\nWhat\u2019s so special about it?:\n\nI believe the Planet 13 is poised to become a market leader in the emerging market of cannabis. Planet 13 is a vertically integrated, meaning it owns its own its own supply chain (cultivating, processing and dispensing.) Investor presentations indicate an emphasis on the \\*experience\\* over products, this is evidenced by their expansive dispensary complex which has interactive stops, coffee shop, restaurants, and event space. In other words, Planet 13 has made its store a must go destination in LV. Think of it as a Disneyland for potheads. \n\nProducts: Outside of simple pot they also sell cannabis vaping products, candies/gummies/chocolates. They also sell planet 13 merch. \n\nNumbers:\n\n\\-Total market cap of $200 million\n\n\\-In store and delivery sales of $63 Million in 2019\n\n\\-Q1 of 2020, a traditionally slow season, was up 20% from Q1 2019\n\n\\-At this time the company remains unprofitable. Net loss in 2019 was about $2.6 million and the company has about $12 million in net cash on hand. However I do expect this to change rapidly over the coming year as they expand their brand into other cities.\n\nAdvantages/Tailwinds:\n\n\\-As stated above, the dispensary is vertically integrated, meaning it owns its own supply chain. However they do sell other products from 3rd parties and these companies want to be on their shelves\n\n\\-It\u2019s the closest dispensary to the strip, just a few minutes taxi ride or walk away.

DED represents an estimated $5B global market dominated by two prescription eye drop products: Restasis (Allergan) and Xiidra (Novartis). Restasis, approved in 2003 and anticipated to go generic this year, achieved net sales of $1.1B in 2019. Xiidra, approved in 2016, is forecast to reach \\~$1.2B in net sales in 2025. OC-01 offers a similar or moderately superior magnitude of efficacy based on pivotal P3 data (ONSET-1 &amp; ONSET-2). OC-01 has a competitive edge given its ROA and rapid time to impact (on the order of weeks), as current agents are associated with eye stinging / discomfort and may take up to several months to achieve effect. We project &gt;250% upside over the current market cap of \\~$730M based on estimated peak sales &gt;$1B and potential M&amp;A takeout value.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* We project peak sales &gt;$1B for OC-01 based on a differentiated product profile, supporting a target valuation of \\~$2.6B (&gt;250% upside over current market cap).\n* The OC-01 program is de-risked from a regulatory standpoint given positive pivotal trials: we estimate a \\~90% probability of approval (NDA filing in 4Q20).\n* As a small biotech, OYST faces significant execution risks for commercialization given the competitive landscape (Allergan, Novartis) and the consumer-driven market, which will necessitate substantial investment in direct-to-consumer commercial efforts.\n* We believe OYST can best maximize shareholder value via an acquisition. While OYST has indicated that it is planning to launch OC-01 on its own, its relatively small market cap (\\~$730M) in relation to its regulatory-ready asset make OYST an attractive takeover target. Comparable deals the OYST team could point to include Novartis\u2019 2019 acquisition of Xiidra from Shire, which closed for $3.4B upfront and $1.9B in milestone payments. Potential partners would bring an existing commercial infrastructure in ophthalmology, such as but not limited to incumbents Allergan/AbbVie or Bausch + Lomb.\n* However, even if no acquisition occurs, OYST still has plans to commercialize OC-01 independently in the U.S., outlining a 150-200 rep sales force and direct-to-consumer campaigns.\n\n**Key Stock Drivers:**\n\n* ***Substantial unmet need for a therapy with rapid onset of effect and an alternative ROA:*** Patients today are limited to over-the-counter artificial tears, which provide only transient relief, or prescription eye drop therapies which can take months to take effect and can cause significant eye irritation, impacting patient quality of life and compliance. \n* ***Large patient population offers substantial market growth potential:*** \\~16M adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with DED, though only \\~10% are receiving prescription therapy (&lt;2 M). OYST cites that \\~7 M diagnosed patients have tried and failed current options, suggesting significant pent-up demand for an efficacious prescription therapy with superior tolerability to current SOC. Even just a fraction of these patients represents a significant commercial opportunity.\n* ***NDA filing for OC-01 expected 2H20:*** After announcing data from a second positive pivotal trial (ONSET-2) earlier this month, OYST plans to file their NDA with the FDA during 2H20. OYST expects commercial launch in 4Q21, and announced plans to hire 150-200 dedicated sales reps, which they expect will be able to target &gt;80% of DED prescribers (both ophthalmologists and optometrists).\n* ***Peak sales estimate &gt;$1B*****:** Analyst consensus and our own projections suggest OC-01 could achieve peak sales of $1-1.3B given the large population, high unmet need, and differentiated product profile. Assuming price parity to Restasis and Xiidra, capturing just \\~5% of the \\~5M patients who have tried and failed current options could translate into &gt;$1B in sales, even before including sales from new patient starts and patients switching from other medications.\n* ***Probability-adjusted valuation of $2.3-3B:*** We forecast a \\~90% chance of approval given positive P3 data, giving us a probability-adjusted peak sales estimate of $0.9-1.2B. A peak sales multiple of \\~2.5x supports a valuation of \\~$2.6B, representing &gt;250% upside over current market cap (\\~$730M). \n* ***We believe there is a high likelihood that OYST will receive acquisition offers:*** We anticipate M&amp;A interest in OYST given its attractive market cap relative to its stage of development and the high barrier to commercial entry in this indication. OYST leadership has also previously explicitly not precluded the idea of an acquisition. We expect large players in this space to at least kick the tires on a deal and for OYST to listen hard, as a deal would be to mutual benefit.\n* ***Additional stock offering closed on 5/19, creating a window to capture value:*** OYST closed an additional public offering on 5/19 at $28, raising \\~$120M in preparation for OC-01 commercialization and further development. This dilutive capital drove OYST\u2019s per share value back down to pre-ONSET-2 readout levels, creating a window to invest at a diluted price point.\n\n**Key Stock Risks:**\n\n* ***Independent commercialization would be challenging and expensive:*** There is substantial execution risk for OC-01 launch as OYST would be competing with much larger players in Allergan and Novartis. In a highly consumer-driven market like DED, direct-to-consumer strategies will be incredibly important. For context, Allergan spent nearly $650M on Restasis advertising in 2016 - 2017 (when competitor Xiidra launched). OYST, meanwhile, reported \\~$130M in cash and cash equivalents in their Q120 filing (though just raised an additional \\~$120M via public offering). OYST leadership has outlined a 3-part strategy encompassing investments in speciality sales reps, DTC marketing, and payer engagement. Driving prescriber and patient awareness of OC-01 will require a heavy commercial lift.\n* ***No pipeline to fuel long-term growth:*** OYST\u2019s R&amp;D strategy is primarily focused on indication expansion for OC-01. While OYST also holds the rights to OC-02, which had previously reached P2 in DED, the program appears to be deprioritized for the time being. OYST will live or die by its ability to get OC-01 to approval and punch above its weight in the market.\n* ***DED market is becoming increasingly competitive:*** Other novel products and the anticipated launch of Restasis generics could disrupt the DED landscape. For example, Sun Pharma recently launched Cequa, a higher concentration of the same active molecule as Restasis, while Kala Pharmaceutial\u2019s Eysuvius recently read out a third P3 trial (required after an FDA rejection last year).

DED represents an estimated $5B global market dominated by two prescription eye drop products: Restasis (Allergan) and Xiidra (Novartis). Restasis, approved in 2003 and anticipated to go generic this year, achieved net sales of $1.1B in 2019. Xiidra, approved in 2016, is forecast to reach \\~$1.2B in net sales in 2025. OC-01 offers a similar or moderately superior magnitude of efficacy based on pivotal P3 data (ONSET-1 &amp; ONSET-2). OC-01 has a competitive edge given its ROA and rapid time to impact (on the order of weeks), as current agents are associated with eye stinging / discomfort and may take up to several months to achieve effect. We project &gt;250% upside over the current market cap of \\~$730M based on estimated peak sales &gt;$1B and potential M&amp;A takeout value.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* We project peak sales &gt;$1B for OC-01 based on a differentiated product profile, supporting a target valuation of \\~$2.6B (&gt;250% upside over current market cap).\n* The OC-01 program is de-risked from a regulatory standpoint given positive pivotal trials: we estimate a \\~90% probability of approval (NDA filing in 4Q20).\n* As a small biotech, OYST faces significant execution risks for commercialization given the competitive landscape (Allergan, Novartis) and the consumer-driven market, which will necessitate substantial investment in direct-to-consumer commercial efforts.\n* We believe OYST can best maximize shareholder value via an acquisition. While OYST has indicated that it is planning to launch OC-01 on its own, its relatively small market cap (\\~$730M) in relation to its regulatory-ready asset make OYST an attractive takeover target. Comparable deals the OYST team could point to include Novartis\u2019 2019 acquisition of Xiidra from Shire, which closed for $3.4B upfront and $1.9B in milestone payments. Potential partners would bring an existing commercial infrastructure in ophthalmology, such as but not limited to incumbents Allergan/AbbVie or Bausch + Lomb.\n* However, even if no acquisition occurs, OYST still has plans to commercialize OC-01 independently in the U.S., outlining a 150-200 rep sales force and direct-to-consumer campaigns.\n\n**Key Stock Drivers:**\n\n* ***Substantial unmet need for a therapy with rapid onset of effect and an alternative ROA:*** Patients today are limited to over-the-counter artificial tears, which provide only transient relief, or prescription eye drop therapies which can take months to take effect and can cause significant eye irritation, impacting patient quality of life and compliance. \n* ***Large patient population offers substantial market growth potential:*** \\~16M adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with DED, though only \\~10% are receiving prescription therapy (&lt;2 M). OYST cites that \\~7 M diagnosed patients have tried and failed current options, suggesting significant pent-up demand for an efficacious prescription therapy with superior tolerability to current SOC. Even just a fraction of these patients represents a significant commercial opportunity.\n* ***NDA filing for OC-01 expected 2H20:*** After announcing data from a second positive pivotal trial (ONSET-2) earlier this month, OYST plans to file their NDA with the FDA during 2H20. OYST expects commercial launch in 4Q21, and announced plans to hire 150-200 dedicated sales reps, which they expect will be able to target &gt;80% of DED prescribers (both ophthalmologists and optometrists).\n* ***Peak sales estimate &gt;$1B*****:** Analyst consensus and our own projections suggest OC-01 could achieve peak sales of $1-1.3B given the large population, high unmet need, and differentiated product profile. Assuming price parity to Restasis and Xiidra, capturing just \\~5% of the \\~5M patients who have tried and failed current options could translate into &gt;$1B in sales, even before including sales from new patient starts and patients switching from other medications.\n* ***Probability-adjusted valuation of $2.3-3B:*** We forecast a \\~90% chance of approval given positive P3 data, giving us a probability-adjusted peak sales estimate of $0.9-1.2B. A peak sales multiple of \\~2.5x supports a valuation of \\~$2.6B, representing &gt;250% upside over current market cap (\\~$730M). \n* ***We believe there is a high likelihood that OYST will receive acquisition offers:*** We anticipate M&amp;A interest in OYST given its attractive market cap relative to its stage of development and the high barrier to commercial entry in this indication. OYST leadership has also previously explicitly not precluded the idea of an acquisition. We expect large players in this space to at least kick the tires on a deal and for OYST to listen hard, as a deal would be to mutual benefit.\n* ***Additional stock offering closed on 5/19, creating a window to capture value:*** OYST closed an additional public offering on 5/19 at $28, raising \\~$120M in preparation for OC-01 commercialization and further development. This dilutive capital drove OYST\u2019s per share value back down to pre-ONSET-2 readout levels, creating a window to invest at a diluted price point.\n\n**Key Stock Risks:**\n\n* ***Independent commercialization would be challenging and expensive:*** There is substantial execution risk for OC-01 launch as OYST would be competing with much larger players in Allergan and Novartis. In a highly consumer-driven market like DED, direct-to-consumer strategies will be incredibly important. For context, Allergan spent nearly $650M on Restasis advertising in 2016 - 2017 (when competitor Xiidra launched). OYST, meanwhile, reported \\~$130M in cash and cash equivalents in their Q120 filing (though just raised an additional \\~$120M via public offering). OYST leadership has outlined a 3-part strategy encompassing investments in speciality sales reps, DTC marketing, and payer engagement. Driving prescriber and patient awareness of OC-01 will require a heavy commercial lift.\n* ***No pipeline to fuel long-term growth:*** OYST\u2019s R&amp;D strategy is primarily focused on indication expansion for OC-01. While OYST also holds the rights to OC-02, which had previously reached P2 in DED, the program appears to be deprioritized for the time being. OYST will live or die by its ability to get OC-01 to approval and punch above its weight in the market.\n* ***DED market is becoming increasingly competitive:*** Other novel products and the anticipated launch of Restasis generics could disrupt the DED landscape. For example, Sun Pharma recently launched Cequa, a higher concentration of the same active molecule as Restasis, while Kala Pharmaceutial\u2019s Eysuvius recently read out a third P3 trial (required after an FDA rejection last year). However, for the most part these therapies are not expected to meaningfully detract from OC-01\u2019s unique value proposition as an intranasal formulation.\n* ***OYST requires substantial additional capital:*** OYST will likely need to identify additional sources of cash (e.g., out-licensing ex-U.S. commercial rights to OC-01) to fund OC-01 commercialization if it does not receive any acquisition offers. \n\nDisclosure:\n\nWe, WX Capital, a team of ex-life-science consultants with a trading and research firm, own shares of Oyster Point Pharma.

The company IPO\u2019ed in 2015 and is led by a highly-respected group of scientists and researchers with a strong track record of successfully developing and commercializing precision oncology medicines. Kura\u2019s primary asset, tipifarnib, has shown impressive data that could help it become the first drug approved for the treatment of HRAS-mutated cancers, providing a line of sight to $500M in peak sales over time. We believe this would support a valuation of $20-25/share over the next year (vs. $16/share today) without even accounting for value from Kura\u2019s earlier stage pipeline. \n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* Kura is currently enrolling its registrational AIM-HN trial that could read out as early as October 2020, and based on tipifarnib\u2019s Phase 2 data, we believe that there is a **strong likelihood of a successful readout**. Kura is developing tipifarnib, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, for HRAS-mutated cancers, starting with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). \n* Tipifarnib could achieve **\\~$500M in peak sales** in HRASm HNSCC alone, with the opportunity to expand into larger HRAS indications as well as earlier lines of treatment through combination therapies. \n* Using a peak sales multiple of 2.5-3x and POS of 75% for tipifarnib, we arrive at a **probability-adjusted value of $20-25/share** based on tipifarnib alone. When factoring in the additional upside potential of the early stage pipeline, we believe that Kura offers an attractive risk-reward from \\~$16/share today. We will be initiating a position in Kura, targeting a 6% weight. \n\n**Key Stock Drivers**\n\n* **Unique asset with scientifically-sound mechanism of action.** HRAS is a gene that, when mutated, produces a defective HRas protein that activates a signaling cascade that has been identified as a central contributor to tumor growth and proliferation. The HRas protein can only activate its signaling pathway by binding to the cell membrane through a process called farnesylation (basically adding a special protein group to HRas). Tipifarnib, Kura\u2019s drug, is a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) that prevents the farnesylation process and thus prevents HRas signaling. While this may sound simple, Kura is currently the only company in the clinic with an FTI and could be the first to market with a drug for HRAS-mutant cancers. \n* **Initial patient population with high unmet need.** HNSCC is the 6th largest cancer indication worldwide, with 60,000 new patients in the US annually. Of these cases, 5-8% (\\~3,000 patients) have an HRAS mutation. The prognosis for these patients using standard immunotherapy and chemo is extremely poor, with an average 15-35% objective response rate (ORR) and 3 months progression free survival (PFS) across 1st and 2nd line therapy. \n* **De-risked Phase 2 data.** Tipifarnib has already demonstrated strong activity in HRASm HNSCC; in its Phase 2 trial, tipifarnib achieved an ORR of 56% (10/18) and a clinical benefit rate of 100% in advanced recurrent/metastatic HRASm HNSCC patients, and a median PFS of 6.1 months. Given the already poor outcomes of HRASm patients, we believe that the bar for approval is low, with 25% ORR and 6 months PFS being sufficient for approval, which compares favorably to what tipifarnib has already achieved. \n* **$500M Peak Sales Potential.** At peak, assuming 3,000 HRASm HNSCC patients, 50% penetration, average treatment duration of 1 year + 10,000 additional HRAS-eligibile patients, 10% penetration (conservative), and 6 months average treatment duration, and an annual price of $250,000, we arrive at $500M in potential peak sales for tipifarnib in HRAS-mutant cancers. \n* **Experienced, accomplished leadership team.** Kura\u2019s management team boasts stellar track records in drug development and commercialization, achieved over decades of industry experience. CEO Troy Wilson previously led Wellspring Biosciences, a notable private, targeted oncology biotech, as well as Intellikine, which was acquired by Takeda. CCO Kirsten Flowers led the successful launches of Brafktovi/Mektovi at Array Biopharma prior to its $11B acquisition by Pfizer. Other team members boast similarly impressive resumes from their time at companies including Merck and Pfizer, where they held senior leadership positions.  \n* **Optionality from early stage pipeline.** Besides HNSCC, tipifarnib is also being evaluated in additional squamous cell carcinomas,  peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CML), where it is currently in Phase 2 trials. These opportunities could represent up to 10,000 additional patients eligible for tipifarnib. Kura is also developing KO-539, a menin-MLL inhibitor, for certain types of leukemia, starting with AML. \n* **Upcoming catalysts in 2020/21.** Kura has clear upcoming milestones that we expect will have a large impact on the stock:\n\n1. ***Late 2020/early 2021.*** Potential readout of registrational AIM-HN trial evaluating tipifranib in HRAS-mutant HNSCC. \n2. ***Mid-2020.*** Data from the ongoing Phase 2 trial evaluating tipifarnib in CMML. \n3. ***Year-end 2020.*** Readout of Phase 1 trial evaluating KO-539 in AML and achievement of a recommended Phase 2 dose. \n\n* **Cash to fund operations into 2022.** Kura ended 1Q20 with $350M in pro-forma cash (includes proceeds from equity issuance in May 2020), which the company expects will fund operations comfortably into 2022. This should provide Kura with ample time to fully enroll the AIM-HN trial barring any extreme delays and support the rest of its clinical programs.\n* **Strong IP estate.** Kura has multiple patents that provide tipifarnib exclusivity in HRASm HNSCC until 2036, while protecting other IP including the mechanism of action, use in combination therapy, and dosing/scheduling, etc. \n\n**Key Stock Risks**\n\n* **Clinical and regulatory failure.** Like most biotechs, Kura\u2019s value would be significantly impaired if tipifarnib were to show worse-than-expected clinical results or severe safety issues. Regulators could also set a higher bar for approval than we are projecting. \n* **Delay of trial timelines.** The biggest near-term risk to Kura is the possibility that the enrollment of the AIM-HN trial is delayed meaningfully past the late 2020/early 2021 target management has guided to. While this would only delay tipifarnib\u2019s data readout, we would expect any material slippage in the trial timeline to have an adverse effect on the stock. \n* **Lower-than-expected HRAS sequencing.** Identifying patients with HRAS-mutant cancers is critical to tipifarnib\u2019s commercial potential. While Kura is working to establish HRAS genetic screening as standard practice, this may be difficult in indications where HRAS mutations are rare (such as HNSCC) and thus limit tipifarnib sales. \n\nDisclosure:\n\nWe currently own shares of Kura Oncology.

The company was founded in 2017 by three gene editing experts: David Liu, Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), Keith Joung, M.D., Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), and Feng Zhang, Ph.D. (one of the inventors of CRISPR gene editing). The CEO, John Evans, was a partner at the VC firm ARCH Venture Partners before joining Beam. Beam\u2019s base-editing platform enables a single targeted base to be replaced while avoiding the double-stranded DNA breaks of the CRISPR/CAS9 approach. To use Beam\u2019s favorite analogy, think of BEAM\u2019s platform as the \u201cpencil and eraser\u201d versus the \u201cscissors\u201d of CRISPR/CAS9. We see Beam as having \\~3x upside dependent on the company reaching the clinic in 2021 or 2022. Near-term (&lt;12 months) inflection points are less predictable given the early nature of Beam\u2019s pipeline, but with the company\u2019s high profile team and platform, events such as strategic partnerships and collaborations could move the stock meaningfully upwards.\n\n***We invested in BEAM (\\~5% of portfolio) on 5/18 given the scientific pedigree of the leadership group, clinical rationale for their next-generation gene-editing platform, anticipated impact of medium-term milestones (e.g., first patient dosed, first preliminary data), and opportunity to invest at an attractive price point versus IPO offering and all-time high. Given the company\u2019s high profile, potential near-term inflection points could also include industry partnerships driving significant market interest, though our long-term investment thesis does not rely on this.***\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* Beam has an exciting and differentiated gene editing technology platform with a crack team of scientific founders and well-connected early investors. Given the history of patent disputes in this space, Beam dedicated a lot of energy to securing a robust IP estate at launch, and are well-positioned on that front.\n* Current market cap of \\~$1.1 B offers \\~3x upside by \\~2022, when we would expect the first programs to reach in-human trials: for reference, CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) has a market cap &gt;$3.7 B with clinical-stage programs in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-T agents. Beam\u2019s most advanced programs are also in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-Ts.\n* We believe that Beam will be competitively positioned in the future despite overlap in their pipeline with current gene editing companies: Beam may be able to more efficiently produce viable ex-vivo gene-edited therapies (e.g., allogeneic CAR-Ts, autologous cells for hematology), and may prove a safer technology for in vivo gene editing applications. \n* The company\u2019s high profile founders and investors may drive significant market interest. Given the IPO priced at $17 and the stock has previously closed above $29, opening a position in Beam today in the $21 - 22 range offers substantial upside.\n* We anticipate that Beam will have little difficulty securing cornerstone industry partnerships to provide additional capital in the near-term if desired, given its well-connected and reputable leadership team.\n\n**Key Stock Drivers:**\n\n* ***Clear clinical need for more precise gene editing tools:*** Direct base editing (rather than relying on non-homologous end-joining and homology-directed repair a la CRISPR/CAS9) could limit the unintended gene disruptions potentially introduced by double-stranded breaks. Beam could theoretically have a more precise and predictable platform that avoids some of the safety concerns with current technologies.\n* ***High-profile company pedigree and scientific leadership*****:** Beam brings an incredibly respected management team and group of initial investors to the table, which both increases our confidence in the company and leads us to expect a lot of market interest in the stock over time. Additionally, Beam, if they choose to do so, is more than capable of pursuing strategic partnerships with larger industry players to bring in cash like many young platform companies do. These partnerships (and the cash, peer validation, and cache they bring) have historically driven up company valuations on their own.\n* ***Broad applicability of platform:*** Point mutations account for 58% of known human genetic variants associated with disease \\[Rees &amp; Liu. Nature Reviews Genetics. 2018\\]. Applying Beam\u2019s base-editing approach could theoretically address these types of genetic variants through gene correction. Beam\u2019s platform could also be used for gene modification (e.g., introducing a protective genotype), gene regulation (via targeting promoter regions), and multiplex base editing (introducing multiple changes to the same cell). Potential applications of the latter include more efficient and complex engineering of cell therapies, which Beam is exploring via their allogeneic CAR-T programs. \n* ***Strong preclinical data for sickle cell and A1AT programs was presented at ASGCT 2020:*** Beam reported promising preclinical data for their sickle cell / beta-thalassemia programs that detailed high success rate for target base-editing and durable expression in in vitro and mouse models. Beam also detailed mouse model data for their A1AT program that suggests potential to address both the hepatic and pulmonary manifestations of A1AT deficiency (current therapies are not disease-modifying, while RNAi approaches would only address hepatic manifestations).\n* ***Strong war chest to build a fully integrated company around a unique platform:*** Beam reported &gt;$250 M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in their 1Q20 filing. Beam launched with \\~$90 M in series A funding in 2018, raised \\~$135 M in their 2019 series B, and just received \\~$190 M in their IPO. They have 12 listed targets in their pipeline across research and lead optimization studies, with their hematology (sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia) and allogeneic CAR-T (ALL and AML) programs being furthest along. Beam expects a \u201cwave\u201d of IND filings in 2021, and will almost certainly be running up quite the tab between now and then given their broad pipeline and ambitions. Even so, $250 M on hand is a good start.\n\n**Key Stock Risks:**\n\n* ***Long wait time to clinical data:*** Beam\u2019s self-reported expectation for IND filings is 2021, assuming preclinical work runs smoothly. This means we aren\u2019t going to see preliminary clinical data before mid-late 2021 or 2022 at the earliest.

The company was founded in 2017 by three gene editing experts: David Liu, Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), Keith Joung, M.D., Ph.D. (Editas co-founder), and Feng Zhang, Ph.D. (one of the inventors of CRISPR gene editing). The CEO, John Evans, was a partner at the VC firm ARCH Venture Partners before joining Beam. Beam\u2019s base-editing platform enables a single targeted base to be replaced while avoiding the double-stranded DNA breaks of the CRISPR/CAS9 approach. To use Beam\u2019s favorite analogy, think of BEAM\u2019s platform as the \u201cpencil and eraser\u201d versus the \u201cscissors\u201d of CRISPR/CAS9. We see Beam as having \\~3x upside dependent on the company reaching the clinic in 2021 or 2022. Near-term (&lt;12 months) inflection points are less predictable given the early nature of Beam\u2019s pipeline, but with the company\u2019s high profile team and platform, events such as strategic partnerships and collaborations could move the stock meaningfully upwards.\n\n***We invested in BEAM (\\~5% of portfolio) on 5/18 given the scientific pedigree of the leadership group, clinical rationale for their next-generation gene-editing platform, anticipated impact of medium-term milestones (e.g., first patient dosed, first preliminary data), and opportunity to invest at an attractive price point versus IPO offering and all-time high. Given the company\u2019s high profile, potential near-term inflection points could also include industry partnerships driving significant market interest, though our long-term investment thesis does not rely on this.***\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* Beam has an exciting and differentiated gene editing technology platform with a crack team of scientific founders and well-connected early investors. Given the history of patent disputes in this space, Beam dedicated a lot of energy to securing a robust IP estate at launch, and are well-positioned on that front.\n* Current market cap of \\~$1.1 B offers \\~3x upside by \\~2022, when we would expect the first programs to reach in-human trials: for reference, CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) has a market cap &gt;$3.7 B with clinical-stage programs in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-T agents. Beam\u2019s most advanced programs are also in sickle cell &amp; beta-thalassemia and allogeneic CAR-Ts.\n* We believe that Beam will be competitively positioned in the future despite overlap in their pipeline with current gene editing companies: Beam may be able to more efficiently produce viable ex-vivo gene-edited therapies (e.g., allogeneic CAR-Ts, autologous cells for hematology), and may prove a safer technology for in vivo gene editing applications. \n* The company\u2019s high profile founders and investors may drive significant market interest. Given the IPO priced at $17 and the stock has previously closed above $29, opening a position in Beam today in the $21 - 22 range offers substantial upside.\n* We anticipate that Beam will have little difficulty securing cornerstone industry partnerships to provide additional capital in the near-term if desired, given its well-connected and reputable leadership team.\n\n**Key Stock Drivers:**\n\n* ***Clear clinical need for more precise gene editing tools:*** Direct base editing (rather than relying on non-homologous end-joining and homology-directed repair a la CRISPR/CAS9) could limit the unintended gene disruptions potentially introduced by double-stranded breaks. Beam could theoretically have a more precise and predictable platform that avoids some of the safety concerns with current technologies.\n* ***High-profile company pedigree and scientific leadership*****:** Beam brings an incredibly respected management team and group of initial investors to the table, which both increases our confidence in the company and leads us to expect a lot of market interest in the stock over time. Additionally, Beam, if they choose to do so, is more than capable of pursuing strategic partnerships with larger industry players to bring in cash like many young platform companies do. These partnerships (and the cash, peer validation, and cache they bring) have historically driven up company valuations on their own.\n* ***Broad applicability of platform:*** Point mutations account for 58% of known human genetic variants associated with disease \\[Rees &amp; Liu. Nature Reviews Genetics. 2018\\]. Applying Beam\u2019s base-editing approach could theoretically address these types of genetic variants through gene correction. Beam\u2019s platform could also be used for gene modification (e.g., introducing a protective genotype), gene regulation (via targeting promoter regions), and multiplex base editing (introducing multiple changes to the same cell). Potential applications of the latter include more efficient and complex engineering of cell therapies, which Beam is exploring via their allogeneic CAR-T programs. \n* ***Strong preclinical data for sickle cell and A1AT programs was presented at ASGCT 2020:*** Beam reported promising preclinical data for their sickle cell / beta-thalassemia programs that detailed high success rate for target base-editing and durable expression in in vitro and mouse models. Beam also detailed mouse model data for their A1AT program that suggests potential to address both the hepatic and pulmonary manifestations of A1AT deficiency (current therapies are not disease-modifying, while RNAi approaches would only address hepatic manifestations).\n* ***Strong war chest to build a fully integrated company around a unique platform:*** Beam reported &gt;$250 M in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in their 1Q20 filing. Beam launched with \\~$90 M in series A funding in 2018, raised \\~$135 M in their 2019 series B, and just received \\~$190 M in their IPO. They have 12 listed targets in their pipeline across research and lead optimization studies, with their hematology (sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia) and allogeneic CAR-T (ALL and AML) programs being furthest along. Beam expects a \u201cwave\u201d of IND filings in 2021, and will almost certainly be running up quite the tab between now and then given their broad pipeline and ambitions. Even so, $250 M on hand is a good start.\n\n**Key Stock Risks:**\n\n* ***Long wait time to clinical data:*** Beam\u2019s self-reported expectation for IND filings is 2021, assuming preclinical work runs smoothly. This means we aren\u2019t going to see preliminary clinical data before mid-late 2021 or 2022 at the earliest. In our experience, the market generally does not move much in response to positive preclinical data or IND clearance, while delays in IND filing can drive down valuation. Buying now exposes us to the risk that preclinical / pre-IND work is significantly delayed. Regarding Covid, Beam has informed investors that the company has been able to conduct its research activities remotely and we do not anticipate its preclinical timeline will be significantly impacted. \n* ***Early slate of programs (e.g., hemoglobinopathies, allogeneic CAR-Ts, GSD 1a, A1AT) are tackling crowded indications:*** The long time to clinic is further complicated by the fact that Beam will be playing catch-up across much of their initial slate of programs. While the scientific rationale for these programs as proof points for the platform is sound, we have some concerns that evolving competition could significantly raise the bar for success by the time Beam is ready for pivotal trials / commercial launch.\n* ***Likely need for additional cash within the next few years may dilute shareholders:*** Beam will need a lot of cash to execute on their ambitious pipeline and lay the foundations to be a fully integrated company (e.g., investments in manufacturing capabilities). If Beam seeks financing via further equity offerings in the next few years, current shareholders may be diluted.\n\nDisclosure:\n\nWe currently own shares of Beam Therapeutics.

A bunch of these launched 4-5 years or so ago and just like in the US they ran up as people jockeyed for position in companies that would one day might be successful.  Winners and losers were picked based on guesses, tea leaves and the statistics of young companies just trying to get traction.\n\nWhile researching many of these companies one (HUYA) caught my eye as they moved their earnings up 1 month.  Companies don\u2019t rush to tell people bad news. Here is the results of my research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHuya $1.15B Market Cap $17.13 Share Price NYSE\n\nEnterprise Value MRQ = $2.8B\n\n67.1 Million Shares Class A (The small amount of shares will amplify this rocketship)\n\n[Huya NYSE](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-HUYA/)\n\nConsidered the 3rd place streaming company by American Investors.  The reality though is it\u2019s number 2 and rising fast when viewed in the macro.  It started in 3rd place in American minds because of it's size, it was started in the 3rd biggest city though and had less to do with the other companies being more successful. Has much better business model and analytics compared to it\u2019s competitors.  One of the many reasons it\u2019s price is suppressed was being listed on NYSE and not NASDAQ like it\u2019s competitors. NYSE has been more negative for Chinese stocks and less sympathetic to tech compared to NASDAQ. Sometimes it\u2019s the little things that are actually big. Currently 12.5% shorted but was as high as 74% on 5/11\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost similar competitor\n\nDoyu  $2.41B Market Cap $7.60 Share Price NASDAQ\n\nEnterprise Value MRQ = $1.7B\n\n317.4 million Shares\n\n[Doyu NASDAQ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-DOYU/)\n\nConsidered the top Publicly Traded Chinese Game Streaming Company by Americans.  Has VERY FEW metrics that are better than Huya and has basically capitalized by taking early mindshare during the exploratory run up and less price suppression due to it being listed on NASDAQ. All the stats it beats Huya on are garbage stats that don\u2019t really mean much.\n\nFrom the jump we can tell that Huya is currently worth over DOUBLE what it trades for with just a cursory glance of the information above.  Let\u2019s talk about this awesome company that is about to take a rocket ship up.\n\nHuya has been working in the lab to become one of the most profitable companies that have EVER EXISTED.  We will discuss this in 3 parts\n\n1. Chinese Domestic Market =  One of the problems with evaluating Chinese companies is the West doesn\u2019t always trust their numbers.   Because of the closed nature of the Chinese Internet and language barriers it is hard for western investors to get a good grip on what is going on.  A lot of the numbers look crazy and Chinese companies in the past have used fake numbers and continue the fakery until they collapse.  This is a contributing factor to HUYA price suppression.\n\nThe video Game Live Streaming Market in China is maturing.  These companies are often called the \u201cTwitch\u201d of China.  In reality they are more like a hybrid of Only Fans, Twitch and ESPN or CBS\n\nLive Streaming is still their bread and butter\n\nTwitch Type Stuff with Gamers\n\n[Twitch type stuff with Gamers](https://www.huya.com/520jiege)\n\nOnly Fans Stuff but probably PG Rated\n\n[Only Fans type stuff but PG rated](https://www.huya.com/5920)\n\nLooks like there is even room for some men to livestream to girls or Chinese Gays.  Who knows\n\n[Livestreamers male and female](https://www.huya.com/g/4079)\n\nThe market is putting more emphasis towards live esports content. (Remember this for part 3)  Like ESPN of video games. This is happening in America as well, Professional sports have an EPIC problem on their hands.  12-24 year olds are starting to NOT WATCH ball and bat sports, they watch  ESPORTS.  Even jocks do this.  Professional sports are going to start to see a YOY erosion of viewership in the next 5 years.\n\nANYONE WHO HAS A TEEN RIGHT NOW CAN PROBABLY VERIFY THIS\n\n[This is the Future, Live Streamed eSports events](https://www.huya.com/2020cfpl)\n\nHuya just signed a bunch of exclusive content deals to secure the streaming rights of major tournaments.  The best western example of this I can give is CBS locking up March Madness and we know what a cash cow that is in America.  Huya is going to be the dominate player for future online esports content.\n\nThe Super Bowl, NBA Finals, World Series as we know it is DYING.  The writing is on the wall and it\u2019s just a matter of time. Do you want to be in on the switch NOW or once the rest of America figures it out?\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/9D1poyj](https://imgur.com/a/9D1poyj)\n\nAbove is a graph showing traffic to the Huya website.  Note the flat line for 5 months and then on the 6th the climb starts (Just 1 month of increased traffic will be on Q1 earnings FYI)  This can be attributed to Huya rolling out it\u2019s plan to be the destination for esports viewership.\n\nHuya has always made the most money pound for pound of any streaming platform in Asia. Their business model is just better.  90% of their revenues comes from the users themselves tipping their favorite streamers with virtual thingamajigs.  The system works and Huya has been able to consistently show some of the best profits.  They have been very smart over the past few years plowing said profits into future operations to the detriment of their share price.  Domestically they used these profits for securing rights so they can shift into a global media player. I\u2019d imagine that in the future Huya sees themselves as the ESPN of China with the twitch thing on the side because it is a cash cow. (Much the same way Netflix still does physical DVD\u2019s.  (It STILL makes fat stacks of cash by old economy standards)\n\nDomestically Huya is the BEST Live Stream play and they prove it with the $$$ but you can also see the stats.  Huya makes more money per on it\u2019s traffic vs competitors and it\u2019s not even close.\n\nAlso domestically things are shifting.  Doyu is falling off and Huya continues to grow and find more audience, better stats and more money. It\u2019s got better stats and better profits than it\u2019s competitor who has double the market cap.  Huya is the king of bad timing (Outside Forces) when it comes to their value and is ahead of the curve when it comes to preparing for the future.\n\nYou can compare some of the stats here\n\n[Alexa Stats Huya        RISING](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/huya.com)\n\nvs\n\n[Alexa Stats Douyu   FADING](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/douyu.com)\n\nThrough out history Huya makes more money with less and their popularity is climbing while Douyu is falling.  In reality though this is like comparing ABC/CBS/NBC to each other in the 80-90s  they will probably ebb and flow as the domestic market changes what they are in to. Huya though has consistently shown they MAKE MORE MONEY WITH LESS and MAKE EVEN MORE MONEY WITH MORE.  The people in charge on this company are smart and make the right choices.  Unfortunately they haven\u2019t been able to reap the rewards of this work. (That changes this week)\n\nWith what people currently know RIGHT NOW.\n\nHuya should trade at $41.81 if we valued the company from it\u2019s KNOWN MRQ.  Why doesn\u2019t it trade in the $40s?\n\n1. Chinese stocks have traditionally been undervalued by US investors for good and bad reasons. The biggest reason though is investors can\u2019t trust a lot of the numbers that we see as we have no baseline for reference and the Chinese market is obfuscated.  What we do know though says that Huya is undervalued RIGHT NOW.\n2. Huya has had a history of epic bad timing.  It\u2019s the unfortunate thing about being a foreign company that is traded on another countries stock exchange.  Often you get compounded negatives.  Those negatives are further compounded by it\u2019s NYSE listing that doesn\u2019t give the same bump to tech stocks like the NASDAQ does.  Huya\u2019s share price has been epically suppressed by outside forces.  It\u2019s a spring at full compression ready to release.\n\nWe will discuss below.\n\nHuya would be on a 2 year Bull run but it didn\u2019t suffer from bad timing.  Here are some graphs to illustrate this position.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7u3fSD8](https://imgur.com/a/7u3fSD8)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/HYynPTP](https://imgur.com/a/HYynPTP)\n\nThese are the overlays of Huya and the S&amp;P 500. Top is all time and bottom is about 10 months.  This is important for scale.  Huya would have been on a Bull Run since December of 2018 but world politics have kept it down.\n\nKey Suppressions\n\n1. March, May, August 2019\n\nTrump fired up his Trade war with a March 2019 Deadline.  Huya was able to stave off the pain until April because it CRUSHED earnings early March but eventually even awesome earnings couldn\u2019t keep it\u2019s stock price up. Notice S&amp;P Dips in May and August.  These was all Chinese \u201cTrade War\u201d uncertainty and they affected Chinese Stocks BIGLY.  Huya kept getting knocked down just as it was rising each of these affect were amplified by it being on the NYSE\n\n2. October 2019\n\nU.S. Commerce Department targeted companies that had human rights violations Huya wasn\u2019t one of these companies but anything bad for China has been in the past bad for Huya.  Huya doesn\u2019t have an identity inside the US market so it is just generically hurt when something bad happens to China and is generically hurt when something bad happens in the US.  For example BABA wasn\u2019t hurt so much by many of these China disruptions because US investors can wrap their hands around BABA a little better IMO.\n\n**THIS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE**\n\n3. December 2019\n\nCorona Virus hits China.  This hammers Huya which is unfortunate.  It should have actually done the opposite.  Americans will understand this if they have followed Chegg, Zoom, Twilio Etc Etc\n\n4. February 2020\n\nCorona Virus jitters hit the US.  This once again Hammers Huya.  (It Shouldn\u2019t)\n\n5.  March 2020\n\nUS Shutdown. Same story. Hammers Huya but should have done the opposite.\n\n6.  May 13th and 14th\n\nLast week Huya is just beginning to RIP but once again it\u2019s trading is affected by US domestic issues.  Lows on these days match the lows of the S&amp;P 500.  Huya has had decreased volume recently because the eyeballs in the US market are elsewhere and with that lower volume it is more sensitive to changes in the broader market.  **THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE**\n\nIn part 1.  We learned that Huya should be trading at $41.81 RIGHT NOW (If it traded at MRQ instead of Market cap, LoL See MELI)  based on what we know about it and if you removed broader market issues that have affected Huya\u2019s stock price negatively.\n\nWe are now at a Stock Price of $41.81\n\n**WE HAVEN\u2019T EVEN GOT TO THE GOOD PART YET**\n\nOne of the reasons Huya hasn\u2019t been viewed as positively as some of the MANY other streaming plays in Asia is while even though they have been posting some AWESOME earnings people felt like they could do more.  At odd times they seemed to have set guidance lower than expected. Americans assumed they were sandbagging so they can beat expectations.  Cheap win to raise the stock price.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t what was going on. HUYA has been in the lab working on WORLD DOMINATION and all the work and hard knocks are about to pay off.\n\nLet me introduce Americans to [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) the GREATEST MONEY MAKING APP OF ALL TIME.  This thing is going to be a juggernaut and it is JUST GETTING STARTED\n\nIt already has more active participation than Twitch.  This is absolute crazy sauce.\n\nTo get an idea how crazy this is TWITCH is the #32 website on the entire Internet according to Alexa\n\n[Alexa Stats TWITCH](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/twitch.tv)\n\nNimo is #4400 and just started climbing.  We left base camp an hour ago.\n\n[Alexa STATS Nimo.TV](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/nimo.tv)\n\nThink about this for a second. Let\u2019s lop off the last number and use a basketball analogy. The Number #3 team in the nation is getting dunked on by the number 440 team in the nation. The women's UMBC basketball team is beating Virginia.\n\nHow is this possible?  This can\u2019t be true?  This is one of the things that have depressed Huya\u2019s stock price.  It\u2019s hard to believe their numbers.  So I did some DD\n\nMany of my kids are gamers.  We spent 2 nights this week playing around with [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV)\n\nI expected them to dump on it because my teenage kids are at the hater age and my younger ones just go with the flow.\n\nThey were stunned. LOVED IT.  I learned some things about it. Many of the games being streamed are not PC games. They are Mobile games.  A lot of the big streamers are using a keyboard and mouse hooked up to their smart phones.  The important part here is the cost of entry for new customers is low. Many Second/Third world countries have the infrastructure to support broadband connections and people there have adequate phones in their pockets and lots of them have phones that are just as powerful as a desktop computer in the US just a few years ago.\n\nThere are 3.5 BILLION smart phones in the world and NIMO integrates them as well as desktops.  The ceiling on this is HUGE.  Seriously the biggest ceiling I have ever seen on a product.\n\nMy kids loved the website and it was popping.  We spent hours on it having a good time.  The genius of it though is the business model.  Streamers are essentially Independent Contractors it looks like. They make money via Diamond Tips that are bought by the viewers.  Unlike the US where our privacy is the product and the media is free.  Most of the world they make you pay to use stuff.  90% of NIMO revenues come from these fees.  No advertising downturns and essentially the talent works on commission.  If you\u2019ve ever worked in sales you will immediately recognize why this is an awesome business model.  Some of these streamers are making bank and you can count up their diamonds.  Even low end streamers get revenue.  The business model is a tread mill. GENIUS\n\nIt was POPPING so POPPING I suspected it wasn\u2019t legit.  NIMO has more ACTIVE VIEWERS than it\u2019s American version that is the Number 32 website in all the internet.\n\nHas to be fake right?\n\nIT\u2019S NOT and it\u2019s gob smacking.  This is just the beginning.  We are at the bottom of the ramp and this ramp is the most distributed and balanced money making machine that has ever been created.\n\nThe world of NIMO where the numbers are crazy and can\u2019t be true. BUT THEY ARE.  Nimo\u2019s business model encourages it\u2019s users to promote their channel.  This thing is gaining traction in 12+ countries, Big Ones and it\u2019s only getting bigger.  Crazy levels of engagement.  Stuff you can\u2019t fake.  Let\u2019s start with NIMO official Social Media Channels\n\nInstagram (Not even a complete list this is just highlights)\n\n[Latin America](https://www.instagram.com/nimotv_latam)\n\n[Argentina](https://www.instagram.com/argonotoficial/)\n\n[Brazil](https://www.instagram.com/nimotv_brasil/)\n\n[Indonesia](https://www.instagram.com/nimotv_id/)\n\nThere are TONS of individual streamers with 6 figure followers on social media\n\n[One of MANY 100k Streamers](https://www.instagram.com/drspeedytv/)\n\nPsiko \u2013 Love this dude, Moroccan and I guess speaks Arabic, dude is crushing it in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait etc etc. He is quickly becoming the most famous person in Morocco and his fame comes from the rich countries in the Middle East.

THIS IS AN ARMY IN THE MAKING\n\n[Girl Streamers as well](https://www.facebook.com/jajarkawaii/)\n\nNIMO is always popping on Twitter and depending on the time of day you can see what countries are in peak usage as the language of the Tweets shift.\n\n[Twitter is always popping for NIMO](https://twitter.com/search?q=Nimo&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live)\n\nLikes and Followers can be faked.  What is hard to fake is the engagement.  Read the comments on these dudes. Armies of 12-25 year olds follow and interact with them and every one of them has their [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) link in their profiles.  They are becoming legit celebrities with people YOU KNOW wanting to take pictures with them.  This is the future.\n\n[NIMO is just getting started APP statistics](https://sensortower.com/android/BR/nimo-tv/app/nimo-tv-live-de-streaming-de-jogos/com.huya.nimo/overview?selected_tab=reviews)\n\nOver 2 million downloads a month right now and has grown exponentially in the past 6 months.  It\u2019s going to be at 10 million a month by the Fall AND THIS ISN\u2019T EVEN STREAMING SEASON YET. May is actually the lowest month traditionally for streamers.\n\nFYI from my research only 1 month in Q1 had the increased traffic that Nimo has benefited from on the books and unlike much of the broad internet market it has retained and INCREASED it\u2019s coronavirus bump.  The seed for Nimo\u2019s success had already been planted. Corona was just the fertilizer.  This means whatever Q1 is Q2 is going to blow it out of the water.\n\nGive you an idea of what kind of valuations one is to place on this kind of heat.\n\n[If Mixer paid $20 Million for Ninja they should have just paid $20 Billion for Nimo](https://mixer.com/browse/all)\n\nMixer payed a streamer called Ninja $20 million plus a year to move to their platform.\n\nMixer currently has less users than [Nimo.Tv](https://Nimo.Tv)\u2019s 25th country.  Nimo has presence all over the world with top and bottom hemispheres.  This is important because it balances the seasonality of profits and bandwidth distribution.  Nimo is seriously set up to be the most stable and distributed profit machine the world has ever seen.\n\nRemember when we discussed that Huya was the most profitable Chinese streaming company despite it being the 3rd in size? IMAGINE HOW MUCH IT IS GOING TO MAKE WITH THIS JUGGERNAUT\n\nAlso the PPP of the countries that it is gaining traction in are mostly HIGHER than China and Brazils is only marginally lesser and statistically very similar.  This answers the question about profitability in foreign countries. Their profits should be the same or greater because the average PPP in the countries it is currently in should be higher than China.  Since it\u2019s distributed to many cultures it will also weather the changes in usage because of trends.  Myspace didn\u2019t have the luxury of revenue from Germany when it started losing users in the US. [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) can and it is on it\u2019s way to becoming the 800lb gorilla in a lot of these markets while domestically Huya had to claw it\u2019s way from the bottom.  I have never been more impressed with a companies trajectory and decision making over it\u2019s first few years than I have with Huya.\n\nThe reason why Huya adjusted guidance was not to sand bag as many suspected.  It was because they were cooking up the Killer App of all Killer apps\n\nIf [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) was a stand alone company it could be worth MORE than Huya but for evaluation purposes we will say that it is worth the same.\n\nBased on what we KNOW about Huya the MRQ justifies a $41.81 share price if [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) is worth that right now we should be valuing Huya at $83.62.  $41.81 x2 and in reality even more as [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) has been a parasite on Huya for the past 2 years and is just now beginning to bring in revenue and because of corona it was perfect timing to capitalize and EXPLODE.\n\nAt $83.62 with 67 Million outstanding shares we have a valuation of $5.61 Billion (Market Cap) for the most profitable streaming company in China that is trending up (Douyu @$2.41B for example is trending down and worth double of Huya currently) Huya is on the pathway to becoming the most popular domestic platform and at the very least number 2 (It\u2019s already Tops in profit).  To be honest a 2.8 Billion Market Cap is UNDERVALUED for the Chinese properties.  It\u2019s MRQ has suffered because Huya has been financing it\u2019s rollout of Nimo for the past 2 years.\n\nWe are now at the Stock Price $83.62\n\nBUT WE HAVEN\u2019T EVEN GOT TO THE GOOD PART YET.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about value.\n\nWHY IS HUYA SO UNDERVALUED?  Timing, Politics and Trust\n\nHuya can\u2019t help it\u2019s timing.  It just got dumped on chronologically because of many things outside it\u2019s control, Politics becomes less of an issue the bigger and more recognizable you get.  That\u2019s why BABA, BIDU and soon JD fluctuate less when bad China news happens. They still fluctuate but less and rebound faster.  The world is about to find out about HUYA and it will receive the same benefit.  Trust,  When I started my research on Chinese companies I came into this as a skeptic.  PDD, IQ, Doyu and others. I looked at them all and I was trying to find things that didn\u2019t smell right and were possibly faked.  We hear all the time about Chinese companies and their shenanigans.  Huya seemed to be totally legit and I believe all of their Chinese numbers are legit.  I can\u2019t really verify a lot of it because of the Great Firewall of China and the nature of the closed Chinese Internet.\n\nWe can however verify a lot of the Metrics on [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) and the gas pedal has been slammed to the floor on this property and it has just gotten started.\n\nSo what is Huya actually worth?\n\n[SE $19 Billion Market Cap](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-SE/)\n\n$19.4 Billion 313.9 Million shares $61.96 share price\n\nThis is SEA.  They make stuff like Garena Free Fire and mobile games.  They are a revenue monster but like many internet companies not super profitable (Unlike Huya) they have a $19B valuation.  Why? Well the company does have legit potential but it has avoided a lot of the blows that Huya got because it\u2019s based in Singapore which has a positive relationship with the US and the openness of it\u2019s internet allows for more scrutiny of it\u2019s operations.  It\u2019s worth this because of it\u2019s revenue and it\u2019s POTENTIAL to be as profitable as a company like HUYA has already proven it can do.  Huya is worth MORE than SE because SE\u2019s value is dependent on it\u2019s properties.  Most things don\u2019t have minecraft levels of sustained enthusiasm and good companies can still release good products that don\u2019t get traction in the market place (See Gameboy Micro) Huya makes profits off of the labors of companies like SE and if SE falters there will be another product to replace it.\n\nHuya will have SE levels of revenue or more this year AND Huya levels of profitability. Remember Q1 2020 only has 1 month of the needle being pegged and it takes awhile for new users to start paying and understanding the platform.  Whatever increases in Q1 I suspect double or more of that will happen in Q2\n\nIf Huya was valued like SE by obtaining similar revenue levels (and it should be more as it\u2019s super profitable) It would be trading at $290+\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOW FOR THE GOOD PART\u2026\u2026  Everything you have read to this point are Third and Second Place when it comes to the valuation of Huya\n\n[DKNG $20 Billion Market Cap](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-DKNG/)\n\n$29.23 Share Price 20.6B Market Cap 705 Million Shares\n\nThis is Draft Kings. They are an American gambling website.  The US market for Sports Gambling is about $880 Million and Projected to be up to $8 Billion in 5 years\n\nSports Gambling Worldwide is about a $110 Billion enterprise of both legal and illegal gambling. So Draft Kings is worth $20.6 Billion RIGHT NOW because of it\u2019s POTENTIAL to have a piece of an $8 Billion Industry (Maybe in 5 years) What do you think DKNG\u2019s market share will be?  Even if it\u2019s 30% (Optimistic) we are talking about $2 Billion in revenue in 5 years.  Watching sports on TV is going the way of the Digital Camera, rear wheel drive sedan and the Travel Agent.  In five years these 17-22 year olds watching Nimo will be 22-27 making money and playing video games.  They won\u2019t be using Draft Kings. As big as esports are to watch (It\u2019s legit big with massive tournaments in places like the Staples Center and Prize money in the millions with endorsements from companies as big as Honda) there is even MORE money in esports gambling.\n\nEsports Gambling is a $15 Billion Dollar Industry RIGHT NOW.  If American Sports gambling is going to grow from $800 million to $8 Billion over the next 5 years how big will the esports gambling market be just in the US? How big worldwide?  At some point esports will overtake Sports Gambling just like the Smart phone overtook the Digital Camera Market.  I personally predict that in 7 years esports gambling will overtake Sports Gambling\n\nDKNG is worth $20 Billion and part of an Industry that is 1/20th the size of the esports gambling industry RIGHT NOW.  It\u2019s entire platform is centered around just gambling. Huya hasn\u2019t even tapped that part of their market and the portion they are eating is currently 20x larger.\n\nBrazil is one of the countries Nimo is booming in and Brazil is also a country with lots of Sports Gamblers.  Bet365 is in the Top 50 websites in Brazil for Internet Traffic\n\nWHY IS THIS IMPORTANT\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/zMrZHco](https://imgur.com/a/zMrZHco)\n\nHidden in the Nimo App is this little nugget, Huya has spent the last couple years cooking up and rolling out the Killer App [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) that could possibly be one of the most profitable Internet properties ever and they are about to pour gasoline on that fire.\n\nMY ADVICE if you have any positions in any of their competitors. SELL IT AND BUY HUYA  If you have stock in MELI SELL IT AND BUY HUYA if you have DKNG SELL HALF AND BUY HUYA if you have SPCE SELL IT AND BUY HUYA\n\nBUY HUYA.  It\u2019s possibly the most undervalued stock ever.  It\u2019s not going to be a secret much longer.  Tick Tock time is running out, Earnings are Wednesday evening and if what I suspect is right it is going to be an EPIC GAP UP\n\nSynopsis\n\nHuya is the most under valued stock in the past 50 years.

I suspect this was made by a computer.  GIGO\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/EfoFbKl](https://imgur.com/a/EfoFbKl)\n\nA human would know that the previous 12 months of this crayon drawing isn't actually flat.  A base was being built with which Huya is going to launch from after it reports earnings.  I count back at least 12 months worth of outside of Huya's control market disruptions.  That's why Huya has traded flat for probably 18 months of it's existence if you looks at the numbers with no context.  These price targets aren't for 12 months in the future it's for 6 months in the past AND Huya is straight killing it.\n\nHow much is a company worth that punches up domestically and then goes on a rampage of worldwide domination in markets that speak 20+ different languages with an army of of their target audience talking about it everywhere?\n\nIF DKNG is worth $20 Billion for a chance to get a PIECE of an $8 Billion market in five years how much is a company that is in a position to eat half the watermelon or more of a $15 Billion dollar market RIGHT NOW?\n\nSE is worth $19 Billion and doesn't have the balance sheet of Huya.

A bunch of these launched 4-5 years or so ago and just like in the US they ran up as people jockeyed for position in companies that would one day might be successful.  Winners and losers were picked based on guesses, tea leaves and the statistics of young companies just trying to get traction.\n\nWhile researching many of these companies one (HUYA) caught my eye as they moved their earnings up 1 month.  Companies don\u2019t rush to tell people bad news. Here is the results of my research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHuya $1.15B Market Cap $17.13 Share Price NYSE\n\nEnterprise Value MRQ = $2.8B\n\n67.1 Million Shares Class A (The small amount of shares will amplify this rocketship)\n\n[Huya NYSE](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-HUYA/)\n\nConsidered the 3rd place streaming company by American Investors.  The reality though is it\u2019s number 2 and rising fast when viewed in the macro.  It started in 3rd place in American minds because of it's size, it was started in the 3rd biggest city though and had less to do with the other companies being more successful. Has much better business model and analytics compared to it\u2019s competitors.  One of the many reasons it\u2019s price is suppressed was being listed on NYSE and not NASDAQ like it\u2019s competitors. NYSE has been more negative for Chinese stocks and less sympathetic to tech compared to NASDAQ. Sometimes it\u2019s the little things that are actually big. Currently 12.5% shorted but was as high as 74% on 5/11\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost similar competitor\n\nDoyu  $2.41B Market Cap $7.60 Share Price NASDAQ\n\nEnterprise Value MRQ = $1.7B\n\n317.4 million Shares\n\n[Doyu NASDAQ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-DOYU/)\n\nConsidered the top Publicly Traded Chinese Game Streaming Company by Americans.  Has VERY FEW metrics that are better than Huya and has basically capitalized by taking early mindshare during the exploratory run up and less price suppression due to it being listed on NASDAQ. All the stats it beats Huya on are garbage stats that don\u2019t really mean much.\n\nFrom the jump we can tell that Huya is currently worth over DOUBLE what it trades for with just a cursory glance of the information above.  Let\u2019s talk about this awesome company that is about to take a rocket ship up.\n\nHuya has been working in the lab to become one of the most profitable companies that have EVER EXISTED.  We will discuss this in 3 parts\n\n1. Chinese Domestic Market =  One of the problems with evaluating Chinese companies is the West doesn\u2019t always trust their numbers.   Because of the closed nature of the Chinese Internet and language barriers it is hard for western investors to get a good grip on what is going on.  A lot of the numbers look crazy and Chinese companies in the past have used fake numbers and continue the fakery until they collapse.  This is a contributing factor to HUYA price suppression.\n\nThe video Game Live Streaming Market in China is maturing.  These companies are often called the \u201cTwitch\u201d of China.  In reality they are more like a hybrid of Only Fans, Twitch and ESPN or CBS\n\nLive Streaming is still their bread and butter\n\nTwitch Type Stuff with Gamers\n\n[Twitch type stuff with Gamers](https://www.huya.com/520jiege)\n\nOnly Fans Stuff but probably PG Rated\n\n[Only Fans type stuff but PG rated](https://www.huya.com/5920)\n\nLooks like there is even room for some men to livestream to girls or Chinese Gays.  Who knows\n\n[Livestreamers male and female](https://www.huya.com/g/4079)\n\nThe market is putting more emphasis towards live esports content. (Remember this for part 3)  Like ESPN of video games. This is happening in America as well, Professional sports have an EPIC problem on their hands.  12-24 year olds are starting to NOT WATCH ball and bat sports, they watch  ESPORTS.  Even jocks do this.  Professional sports are going to start to see a YOY erosion of viewership in the next 5 years.\n\nANYONE WHO HAS A TEEN RIGHT NOW CAN PROBABLY VERIFY THIS\n\n[This is the Future, Live Streamed eSports events](https://www.huya.com/2020cfpl)\n\nHuya just signed a bunch of exclusive content deals to secure the streaming rights of major tournaments.  The best western example of this I can give is CBS locking up March Madness and we know what a cash cow that is in America.  Huya is going to be the dominate player for future online esports content.\n\nThe Super Bowl, NBA Finals, World Series as we know it is DYING.  The writing is on the wall and it\u2019s just a matter of time. Do you want to be in on the switch NOW or once the rest of America figures it out?\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/9D1poyj](https://imgur.com/a/9D1poyj)\n\nAbove is a graph showing traffic to the Huya website.  Note the flat line for 5 months and then on the 6th the climb starts (Just 1 month of increased traffic will be on Q1 earnings FYI)  This can be attributed to Huya rolling out it\u2019s plan to be the destination for esports viewership.\n\nHuya has always made the most money pound for pound of any streaming platform in Asia. Their business model is just better.  90% of their revenues comes from the users themselves tipping their favorite streamers with virtual thingamajigs.  The system works and Huya has been able to consistently show some of the best profits.  They have been very smart over the past few years plowing said profits into future operations to the detriment of their share price.  Domestically they used these profits for securing rights so they can shift into a global media player. I\u2019d imagine that in the future Huya sees themselves as the ESPN of China with the twitch thing on the side because it is a cash cow. (Much the same way Netflix still does physical DVD\u2019s.  (It STILL makes fat stacks of cash by old economy standards)\n\nDomestically Huya is the BEST Live Stream play and they prove it with the $$$ but you can also see the stats.  Huya makes more money per on it\u2019s traffic vs competitors and it\u2019s not even close.\n\nAlso domestically things are shifting.  Doyu is falling off and Huya continues to grow and find more audience, better stats and more money. It\u2019s got better stats and better profits than it\u2019s competitor who has double the market cap.  Huya is the king of bad timing (Outside Forces) when it comes to their value and is ahead of the curve when it comes to preparing for the future.\n\nYou can compare some of the stats here\n\n[Alexa Stats Huya        RISING](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/huya.com)\n\nvs\n\n[Alexa Stats Douyu   FADING](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/douyu.com)\n\nThrough out history Huya makes more money with less and their popularity is climbing while Douyu is falling.  In reality though this is like comparing ABC/CBS/NBC to each other in the 80-90s  they will probably ebb and flow as the domestic market changes what they are in to. Huya though has consistently shown they MAKE MORE MONEY WITH LESS and MAKE EVEN MORE MONEY WITH MORE.  The people in charge on this company are smart and make the right choices.  Unfortunately they haven\u2019t been able to reap the rewards of this work. (That changes this week)\n\nWith what people currently know RIGHT NOW.\n\nHuya should trade at $41.81 if we valued the company from it\u2019s KNOWN MRQ.  Why doesn\u2019t it trade in the $40s?\n\n1. Chinese stocks have traditionally been undervalued by US investors for good and bad reasons. The biggest reason though is investors can\u2019t trust a lot of the numbers that we see as we have no baseline for reference and the Chinese market is obfuscated.  What we do know though says that Huya is undervalued RIGHT NOW.\n2. Huya has had a history of epic bad timing.  It\u2019s the unfortunate thing about being a foreign company that is traded on another countries stock exchange.  Often you get compounded negatives.  Those negatives are further compounded by it\u2019s NYSE listing that doesn\u2019t give the same bump to tech stocks like the NASDAQ does.  Huya\u2019s share price has been epically suppressed by outside forces.  It\u2019s a spring at full compression ready to release.\n\nWe will discuss below.\n\nHuya would be on a 2 year Bull run but it didn\u2019t suffer from bad timing.  Here are some graphs to illustrate this position.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7u3fSD8](https://imgur.com/a/7u3fSD8)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/HYynPTP](https://imgur.com/a/HYynPTP)\n\nThese are the overlays of Huya and the S&amp;P 500. Top is all time and bottom is about 10 months.  This is important for scale.  Huya would have been on a Bull Run since December of 2018 but world politics have kept it down.\n\nKey Suppressions\n\n1. March, May, August 2019\n\nTrump fired up his Trade war with a March 2019 Deadline.  Huya was able to stave off the pain until April because it CRUSHED earnings early March but eventually even awesome earnings couldn\u2019t keep it\u2019s stock price up. Notice S&amp;P Dips in May and August.  These was all Chinese \u201cTrade War\u201d uncertainty and they affected Chinese Stocks BIGLY.  Huya kept getting knocked down just as it was rising each of these affect were amplified by it being on the NYSE\n\n2. October 2019\n\nU.S. Commerce Department targeted companies that had human rights violations Huya wasn\u2019t one of these companies but anything bad for China has been in the past bad for Huya.  Huya doesn\u2019t have an identity inside the US market so it is just generically hurt when something bad happens to China and is generically hurt when something bad happens in the US.  For example BABA wasn\u2019t hurt so much by many of these China disruptions because US investors can wrap their hands around BABA a little better IMO.\n\n**THIS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE**\n\n3. December 2019\n\nCorona Virus hits China.  This hammers Huya which is unfortunate.  It should have actually done the opposite.  Americans will understand this if they have followed Chegg, Zoom, Twilio Etc Etc\n\n4. February 2020\n\nCorona Virus jitters hit the US.  This once again Hammers Huya.  (It Shouldn\u2019t)\n\n5.  March 2020\n\nUS Shutdown. Same story. Hammers Huya but should have done the opposite.\n\n6.  May 13th and 14th\n\nLast week Huya is just beginning to RIP but once again it\u2019s trading is affected by US domestic issues.  Lows on these days match the lows of the S&amp;P 500.  Huya has had decreased volume recently because the eyeballs in the US market are elsewhere and with that lower volume it is more sensitive to changes in the broader market.  **THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE**\n\nIn part 1.  We learned that Huya should be trading at $41.81 RIGHT NOW (If it traded at MRQ instead of Market cap, LoL See MELI)  based on what we know about it and if you removed broader market issues that have affected Huya\u2019s stock price negatively.\n\nWe are now at a Stock Price of $41.81\n\n**WE HAVEN\u2019T EVEN GOT TO THE GOOD PART YET**\n\nOne of the reasons Huya hasn\u2019t been viewed as positively as some of the MANY other streaming plays in Asia is while even though they have been posting some AWESOME earnings people felt like they could do more.  At odd times they seemed to have set guidance lower than expected. Americans assumed they were sandbagging so they can beat expectations.  Cheap win to raise the stock price.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t what was going on. HUYA has been in the lab working on WORLD DOMINATION and all the work and hard knocks are about to pay off.\n\nLet me introduce Americans to [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) the GREATEST MONEY MAKING APP OF ALL TIME.  This thing is going to be a juggernaut and it is JUST GETTING STARTED\n\nIt already has more active participation than Twitch.  This is absolute crazy sauce.\n\nTo get an idea how crazy this is TWITCH is the #32 website on the entire Internet according to Alexa\n\n[Alexa Stats TWITCH](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/twitch.tv)\n\nNimo is #4400 and just started climbing.  We left base camp an hour ago.\n\n[Alexa STATS Nimo.TV](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/nimo.tv)\n\nThink about this for a second. Let\u2019s lop off the last number and use a basketball analogy. The Number #3 team in the nation is getting dunked on by the number 440 team in the nation. The women's UMBC basketball team is beating Virginia.\n\nHow is this possible?  This can\u2019t be true?  This is one of the things that have depressed Huya\u2019s stock price.  It\u2019s hard to believe their numbers.  So I did some DD\n\nMany of my kids are gamers.  We spent 2 nights this week playing around with [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV)\n\nI expected them to dump on it because my teenage kids are at the hater age and my younger ones just go with the flow.\n\nThey were stunned. LOVED IT.  I learned some things about it. Many of the games being streamed are not PC games. They are Mobile games.  A lot of the big streamers are using a keyboard and mouse hooked up to their smart phones.  The important part here is the cost of entry for new customers is low. Many Second/Third world countries have the infrastructure to support broadband connections and people there have adequate phones in their pockets and lots of them have phones that are just as powerful as a desktop computer in the US just a few years ago.\n\nThere are 3.5 BILLION smart phones in the world and NIMO integrates them as well as desktops.  The ceiling on this is HUGE.  Seriously the biggest ceiling I have ever seen on a product.\n\nMy kids loved the website and it was popping.  We spent hours on it having a good time.  The genius of it though is the business model.  Streamers are essentially Independent Contractors it looks like. They make money via Diamond Tips that are bought by the viewers.  Unlike the US where our privacy is the product and the media is free.  Most of the world they make you pay to use stuff.  90% of NIMO revenues come from these fees.  No advertising downturns and essentially the talent works on commission.  If you\u2019ve ever worked in sales you will immediately recognize why this is an awesome business model.  Some of these streamers are making bank and you can count up their diamonds.  Even low end streamers get revenue.  The business model is a tread mill. GENIUS\n\nIt was POPPING so POPPING I suspected it wasn\u2019t legit.  NIMO has more ACTIVE VIEWERS than it\u2019s American version that is the Number 32 website in all the internet.\n\nHas to be fake right?\n\nIT\u2019S NOT and it\u2019s gob smacking.  This is just the beginning.  We are at the bottom of the ramp and this ramp is the most distributed and balanced money making machine that has ever been created.\n\nThe world of NIMO where the numbers are crazy and can\u2019t be true. BUT THEY ARE.  Nimo\u2019s business model encourages it\u2019s users to promote their channel.  This thing is gaining traction in 12+ countries, Big Ones and it\u2019s only getting bigger.  Crazy levels of engagement.  Stuff you can\u2019t fake.  Let\u2019s start with NIMO official Social Media Channels\n\nInstagram (Not even a complete list this is just highlights)\n\n[Latin America](https://www.instagram.com/nimotv_latam)\n\n[Argentina](https://www.instagram.com/argonotoficial/)\n\n[Brazil](https://www.instagram.com/nimotv_brasil/)\n\n[Indonesia](https://www.instagram.com/nimotv_id/)\n\nThere are TONS of individual streamers with 6 figure followers on social media\n\n[One of MANY 100k Streamers](https://www.instagram.com/drspeedytv/)\n\nPsiko \u2013 Love this dude, Moroccan and I guess speaks Arabic, dude is crushing it in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait etc etc. He is quickly becoming the most famous person in Morocco and his fame comes from the rich countries in the Middle East.

There are DOZENS and DOZENS of streamers with 6 figure followers just in Brazil. Their will be 100 of them by the end of summer.

THIS IS AN ARMY IN THE MAKING\n\n[Girl Streamers as well](https://www.facebook.com/jajarkawaii/)\n\nNIMO is always popping on Twitter and depending on the time of day you can see what countries are in peak usage as the language of the Tweets shift.\n\n[Twitter is always popping for NIMO](https://twitter.com/search?q=Nimo&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live)\n\nLikes and Followers can be faked.  What is hard to fake is the engagement.  Read the comments on these dudes. Armies of 12-25 year olds follow and interact with them and every one of them has their [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) link in their profiles.  They are becoming legit celebrities with people YOU KNOW wanting to take pictures with them.  This is the future.\n\n[NIMO is just getting started APP statistics](https://sensortower.com/android/BR/nimo-tv/app/nimo-tv-live-de-streaming-de-jogos/com.huya.nimo/overview?selected_tab=reviews)\n\nOver 2 million downloads a month right now and has grown exponentially in the past 6 months.  It\u2019s going to be at 10 million a month by the Fall AND THIS ISN\u2019T EVEN STREAMING SEASON YET. May is actually the lowest month traditionally for streamers.\n\nFYI from my research only 1 month in Q1 had the increased traffic that Nimo has benefited from on the books and unlike much of the broad internet market it has retained and INCREASED it\u2019s coronavirus bump.  The seed for Nimo\u2019s success had already been planted. Corona was just the fertilizer.  This means whatever Q1 is Q2 is going to blow it out of the water.\n\nGive you an idea of what kind of valuations one is to place on this kind of heat.\n\n[If Mixer paid $20 Million for Ninja they should have just paid $20 Billion for Nimo](https://mixer.com/browse/all)\n\nMixer payed a streamer called Ninja $20 million plus a year to move to their platform.\n\nMixer currently has less users than [Nimo.Tv](https://Nimo.Tv)\u2019s 25th country.  Nimo has presence all over the world with top and bottom hemispheres.  This is important because it balances the seasonality of profits and bandwidth distribution.  Nimo is seriously set up to be the most stable and distributed profit machine the world has ever seen.\n\nRemember when we discussed that Huya was the most profitable Chinese streaming company despite it being the 3rd in size? IMAGINE HOW MUCH IT IS GOING TO MAKE WITH THIS JUGGERNAUT\n\nAlso the PPP of the countries that it is gaining traction in are mostly HIGHER than China and Brazils is only marginally lesser and statistically very similar.  This answers the question about profitability in foreign countries. Their profits should be the same or greater because the average PPP in the countries it is currently in should be higher than China.  Since it\u2019s distributed to many cultures it will also weather the changes in usage because of trends.  Myspace didn\u2019t have the luxury of revenue from Germany when it started losing users in the US. [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) can and it is on it\u2019s way to becoming the 800lb gorilla in a lot of these markets while domestically Huya had to claw it\u2019s way from the bottom.  I have never been more impressed with a companies trajectory and decision making over it\u2019s first few years than I have with Huya.\n\nThe reason why Huya adjusted guidance was not to sand bag as many suspected.  It was because they were cooking up the Killer App of all Killer apps\n\nIf [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) was a stand alone company it could be worth MORE than Huya but for evaluation purposes we will say that it is worth the same.\n\nBased on what we KNOW about Huya the MRQ justifies a $41.81 share price if [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) is worth that right now we should be valuing Huya at $83.62.  $41.81 x2 and in reality even more as [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) has been a parasite on Huya for the past 2 years and is just now beginning to bring in revenue and because of corona it was perfect timing to capitalize and EXPLODE.\n\nAt $83.62 with 67 Million outstanding shares we have a valuation of $5.61 Billion (Market Cap) for the most profitable streaming company in China that is trending up (Douyu @$2.41B for example is trending down and worth double of Huya currently) Huya is on the pathway to becoming the most popular domestic platform and at the very least number 2 (It\u2019s already Tops in profit).  To be honest a 2.8 Billion Market Cap is UNDERVALUED for the Chinese properties.  It\u2019s MRQ has suffered because Huya has been financing it\u2019s rollout of Nimo for the past 2 years.\n\nWe are now at the Stock Price $83.62\n\nBUT WE HAVEN\u2019T EVEN GOT TO THE GOOD PART YET.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about value.\n\nWHY IS HUYA SO UNDERVALUED?  Timing, Politics and Trust\n\nHuya can\u2019t help it\u2019s timing.  It just got dumped on chronologically because of many things outside it\u2019s control, Politics becomes less of an issue the bigger and more recognizable you get.  That\u2019s why BABA, BIDU and soon JD fluctuate less when bad China news happens. They still fluctuate but less and rebound faster.  The world is about to find out about HUYA and it will receive the same benefit.  Trust,  When I started my research on Chinese companies I came into this as a skeptic.  PDD, IQ, Doyu and others. I looked at them all and I was trying to find things that didn\u2019t smell right and were possibly faked.  We hear all the time about Chinese companies and their shenanigans.  Huya seemed to be totally legit and I believe all of their Chinese numbers are legit.  I can\u2019t really verify a lot of it because of the Great Firewall of China and the nature of the closed Chinese Internet.\n\nWe can however verify a lot of the Metrics on [NIMO.TV](https://NIMO.TV) and the gas pedal has been slammed to the floor on this property and it has just gotten started.\n\nSo what is Huya actually worth?\n\n[SE $19 Billion Market Cap](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-SE/)\n\n$19.4 Billion 313.9 Million shares $61.96 share price\n\nThis is SEA.  They make stuff like Garena Free Fire and mobile games.  They are a revenue monster but like many internet companies not super profitable (Unlike Huya) they have a $19B valuation.  Why? Well the company does have legit potential but it has avoided a lot of the blows that Huya got because it\u2019s based in Singapore which has a positive relationship with the US and the openness of it\u2019s internet allows for more scrutiny of it\u2019s operations.  It\u2019s worth this because of it\u2019s revenue and it\u2019s POTENTIAL to be as profitable as a company like HUYA has already proven it can do.  Huya is worth MORE than SE because SE\u2019s value is dependent on it\u2019s properties.  Most things don\u2019t have minecraft levels of sustained enthusiasm and good companies can still release good products that don\u2019t get traction in the market place (See Gameboy Micro) Huya makes profits off of the labors of companies like SE and if SE falters there will be another product to replace it.\n\nHuya will have SE levels of revenue or more this year AND Huya levels of profitability. Remember Q1 2020 only has 1 month of the needle being pegged and it takes awhile for new users to start paying and understanding the platform.  Whatever increases in Q1 I suspect double or more of that will happen in Q2\n\nIf Huya was valued like SE by obtaining similar revenue levels (and it should be more as it\u2019s super profitable) It would be trading at $290+\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOW FOR THE GOOD PART\u2026\u2026  Everything you have read to this point are Third and Second Place when it comes to the valuation of Huya\n\n[DKNG $20 Billion Market Cap](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-DKNG/)\n\n$29.23 Share Price 20.6B Market Cap 705 Million Shares\n\nThis is Draft Kings. They are an American gambling website.  The US market for Sports Gambling is about $880 Million and Projected to be up to $8 Billion in 5 years\n\nSports Gambling Worldwide is about a $110 Billion enterprise of both legal and illegal gambling. So Draft Kings is worth $20.6 Billion RIGHT NOW because of it\u2019s POTENTIAL to have a piece of an $8 Billion Industry (Maybe in 5 years) What do you think DKNG\u2019s market share will be?  Even if it\u2019s 30% (Optimistic) we are talking about $2 Billion in revenue in 5 years.  Watching sports on TV is going the way of the Digital Camera, rear wheel drive sedan and the Travel Agent.  In five years these 17-22 year olds watching Nimo will be 22-27 making money and playing video games.  They won\u2019t be using Draft Kings. As big as esports are to watch (It\u2019s legit big with massive tournaments in places like the Staples Center and Prize money in the millions with endorsements from companies as big as Honda) there is even MORE money in esports gambling.\n\nEsports Gambling is a $15 Billion Dollar Industry RIGHT NOW.  If American Sports gambling is going to grow from $800 million to $8 Billion over the next 5 years how big will the esports gambling market be just in the US? How big worldwide?  At some point esports will overtake Sports Gambling just like the Smart phone overtook the Digital Camera Market.  I personally predict that in 7 years esports gambling will overtake Sports Gambling\n\nDKNG is worth $20 Billion and part of an Industry that is 1/20th the size of the esports gambling industry RIGHT NOW.  It\u2019s entire platform is centered around just gambling. Huya hasn\u2019t even tapped that part of their market and the portion they are eating is currently 20x larger.\n\nBrazil is one of the countries Nimo is booming in and Brazil is also a country with lots of Sports Gamblers.  Bet365 is in the Top 50 websites in Brazil for Internet Traffic\n\nWHY IS THIS IMPORTANT\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/zMrZHco](https://imgur.com/a/zMrZHco)\n\nHidden in the Nimo App is this little nugget, Huya has spent the last couple years cooking up and rolling out the Killer App [Nimo.TV](https://Nimo.TV) that could possibly be one of the most profitable Internet properties ever and they are about to pour gasoline on that fire.\n\nMY ADVICE if you have any positions in any of their competitors. SELL IT AND BUY HUYA  If you have stock in MELI SELL IT AND BUY HUYA if you have DKNG SELL HALF AND BUY HUYA if you have SPCE SELL IT AND BUY HUYA\n\nBUY HUYA.  It\u2019s possibly the most undervalued stock ever.  It\u2019s not going to be a secret much longer.  Tick Tock time is running out, Earnings are Wednesday evening and if what I suspect is right it is going to be an EPIC GAP UP\n\nSynopsis\n\nHuya is the most under valued stock in the past 50 years.

A base was being built with which Huya is going to launch from after it reports earnings.  I count back at least 12 months worth of outside of Huya's control market disruptions.  That's why Huya has traded flat for probably 18 months of it's existence if you looks at the numbers with no context.  These price targets aren't for 12 months in the future it's for 6 months in the past AND Huya is straight killing it.\n\nHow much is a company worth that punches up domestically and then goes on a rampage of worldwide domination in markets that speak 20+ different languages with an army of of their target audience talking about it everywhere?\n\nIF DKNG is worth $20 Billion for a chance to get a PIECE of an $8 Billion market in five years how much is a company that is in a position to eat half the watermelon or more of a $15 Billion dollar market RIGHT NOW?\n\nSE is worth $19 Billion and doesn't have the balance sheet of Huya.

These data will support the ALPHA2 P1 and potential pivotal P2 trial for ALLO-501A, their next-generation construct for NHL. Initial P1 data for ALLO-715 in r/r MM (UNIVERSAL trial) remains on track for 4Q20 despite impact of COVID-19\n* ***Experienced leadership team with track record of rapid development and regulatory success in cell therapy:*** CEO David Chang and Executive Chairman Arie Belldegrun were formerly CMO and CEO of Kite Pharma, respectively, and led Yescarta, one of two CAR-T\u2019s on market today, to FDA priority review prior to acquisition by Gilead for $11.9 B (29.4% premium over market close prior to announcement)\n* ***Clinical programs focus largely on proven targets:*** ALLO-501/ALLO-501A and UCART19 are anti-CD19 therapies, which is the same target as the approved autologous CAR-Ts Yescarta and Kymriah, which somewhat de-risks these programs. Additional targets in development include BCMA for MM (ALLO-715, including in combination with nirogacestat in collaboration with SpringWorks)\n* ***Preliminary UCART19 data offers additional validation of platform:*** preliminary pooled data from P1 trials in ALL indicated that 14/17 (82%) of patients receiving an anti-CD52 antibody during lymphodepletion achieved a complete response (CR/CRi). The anti-CD52 antibody serves to protect the allogeneic CAR-T\u2019s from being cleared by the body\u2019s immune system. ALLO-501, ALLO-501A, and ALLO-715 are all dosed with ALLO-647, Allogene\u2019s internally developed anti-CD52 antibody, creating a \u201cwindow of persistence\u201d during which the allogeneic CAR-T\u2019s can exert their therapeutic effect\n\n**Key Stock Risks:**\n\n* ***Value of pipeline programs heavily interdependent:*** Given the clinical stage therapies are rooted in the same technology platform, any issues that emerge from the ALPHA or UNIVERSAL trials could feasibly drag down the value of the entire pipeline.

This suggests there is significant immediate downside if the data falls short of expectations on 5/13 and 5/29\n* ***Long-term competitive risk is substantial:*** While Allogene is a leader in the field, the next-generation CAR-T space is fairly crowded. In addition, Fate Therapeutics (market cap: $2.3 B) has a pipeline of iPSC-derived natural killer and T cell therapies for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors reaching the clinic.

We like Springworks for several key reasons: \n\n* The company has two late-stage (Phase 2/3) programs, nirogacestat and mirdametinib, targeting rare tumor types with high unmet need (either insufficient therapies or no available therapies). Past trial data gives us confidence in their chances of approval, and we expect these candidates to be approved in 2022 and 2023 respectively, upon which they will become first-in-class drugs in their respective indications through their differentiated clinical profiles. \n* Springworks has signed collaborations with major biotech companies to develop several interesting early stage assets in additional oncology indications, providing a degree of validation of Springworks\u2019 assets and creating a future growth runway. \n* We anticipate several value-creating milestones over the next year, namely topline data from nirogacestat\u2019s registrational Phase 3 trial in mid-2021 and an interim update from mirdametinib\u2019s registrational Phase 2b in 1Q21. \n* Our DCF analysis assigns Springworks a price target of $55, assuming an 85% probability of success for nirogacestat and mirdametinib in their main indications, and using an 11% discount rate and 2% terminal growth rate. \n\n**Company Background:** Springworks was established in 2017 as a spinoff from Pfizer, which provided the company with initial funding and the development rights to its 4 clinical assets. Springworks raised \\~$230M from investors including Bain Capital and OrbiMed Advisors before going public in September 2019. \n\n**1. Late-stage Clinical Programs in Areas of High Unmet Need:** Springworks has two late stage programs currently in registrational or potentially registrational trials:\n\nNirogacestat. Nirogacestat is an oral, selective gamma secretase inhibitor developed to treat desmoid tumors. \n\n* *Desmoid tumors.* Desmoid tumors are highly morbid, soft tissue tumors with an estimated 6,000 patients being treated in the US every year. \n* *Unmet need.* Though survival rates for desmoid tumors are relatively high compared to other cancer types, desmoid tumors place a heavy burden on patients\u2019 quality of life; they can interfere with the function of nearby structures (e.g. intestines), are painful to live with, and highly disfiguring. Treatment has traditionally been via surgical resection, but this method has been associated with recurrence rates of up to 70%. Chemotherapy and other targeted cancer therapies have been used off-label as well, but these have shown inconsistent efficacy and unfavorable safety profiles. \n* Nirogacestat has received FDA breakthrough and orphan drug designation.\n\nMirdametinib. Mirdametinib is an oral, selective MEK inhibitor developed to treat NF1-associate plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN). \n\n* *NF1-PN.* The NF1 gene produces neurofibromin, a protein that represses a key signaling pathway (RAS/MAPK) responsible for the growth of many cancers. When the NF1 gene is mutated, the loss of neurofibromin production allows this pathway to run unchecked, resulting in tumor growth across the body. There are \\~100k NF1 patients in the US, and 30-50% of these patients can develop plexiform neurofibromas, which are tumors that grow along nerves. \n* *Unmet need.* NF1-PN are associated with extreme pain and disfigurement as well as interference with neurocognitive function. First-line therapy is usually surgical resection, but NF1-PN extensive growth patterns along nerves make them hard to completely remove (while risking nerve damage). \n* There is one approved MEK inhibitor for NF1-PN, AstaZeneca\u2019s selumetinib, which was approved in April 2020. While the drug works, mirdametinib has demonstrated a potentially superior safety profile vs. selumetinib, which should allow patients to remain on therapy longer and experience more clinical benefit. \n* Mirdametinib has received FDA orphan drug designation. \n\n**2. Promising Clinical Data.** \n\nNirogacestat. To date, nirogacestat has shown a promising clinical profile in its Phase 1 and 2 trials. The drug is currently enrolling patients in its Phase 3 trial, with progression free survival (PFS, a measure of how long patients live without their tumors growing &gt;20% in size) as the primary endpoint. \n\n* *Phase 1.* Nirogacestat achieved an objective response rate (ORR) of 71.4% in its 7-patient Phase 1 trial (5/7), and a 100% disease control rate (DCR). Patients were able to stay on the drug for a median of 49.5 months (at the time of publication, so possibly longer), and none went off treatment due to safety issues. \n* *Phase 2.* In a heavily pre-treated population (median 4 lines of prior therapy vs. 3 in Phase 1 i.e. sicker patients), nirogacestat again achieved a 100% DCR and a 29.4% ORR. More importantly, 59% of patients remained on drug for more than 2 years. The drug was well tolerated with only 1 patient discontinuing treatment due to side effects. \n* *Phase 3.* A 115-patient Phase 3 trial is currently enrolling patients. The trial is powered to show a 12-month difference in PFS vs. placebo, and past trials from a similar drug showed that 50% of placebo patients experience disease progression by 8 months, which compares favorably to what nirogacestat has demonstrated in its Phase 1/2 trials. \n* The Phase 3 trial is expected to readout in 2Q/3Q21 and we expect approval of nirogacestat in 2022. \n\nMirdametinib.  \n\n* *Phase 2.* In its Phase 2 trial, Mirdametinib demonstrated a 42% ORR in 8/19 patients. In contrast, selumetinib demonstrated a 74% ORR in its Phase 2 trial. Though selumetinib\u2019s Phase 2 data was numerically superior to mirdametinib\u2019s, we believe several factors artificially limited mirdametinib\u2019s efficacy:\n   * Selumetinib\u2019s trial enrolled only children while mirdametinib\u2019s trial included only patients 16 years or older. Tumors in younger children are considered to be more responsive to therapy than those in adults. \n   * Patients in the mirdametinib trial were removed from the trial if they did not show signs of benefit within 12 months, which may have limited the number responses; 30% of selumetinib\u2019s patients did not respond until after 12 months on drug. \n* *Safety benefits.* In its Phase 2, only 5 out of 19 patients (26%) required dose reductions of mirdametinib. In contrast, in selumetinib\u2019s Phase 1, 10 out of 24 patients (42%) required dose reductions due to toxicity issues. We believe that this is evidence that mirdametinib is a safer drug than selumetinib, which will be an important differentiating factor for doctors deciding between the two drugs. \n* *Phase 2b.* Springworks is currently enrolling patients for a 100-patient Phase 2b trial of mirdametinib (primary endpoint ORR) that could support approval in 2023. The trial will enroll an even split of pediatric and adult patients and will not remove patients before 12 months. We expect that mirdametinib will show a similar ORR to selumetinib and differentiate itself via a superior safety profile. \n\n**3. Intriguing Early Stage Programs.**\n\n* **Nirogacestat for Multiple Myeloma Therapy.** Nirogacestat is also being evaluated as an add-on therapy to BCMA therapies for multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells with \\~27k patients in the US every year. These drugs target a protein called BCMA on the surface of cancer cells, and preclinical data has shown that nirogacestat significantly upregulates the expression of BCMA on cancer cells and enhanced the potency of BCMA-targeting drugs. Springworks has already signed collaborations with Glaxo Smith Kline and Allogene Therapeutics to use nirogacestat in combination trials with their BCMA drugs. \n* **BGB-3245.** Springworks has also signed a collaboration agreement with Beigene, a leading China biotech company, to develop a novel cancer drug targeting BRAF-mutant solid tumors. BRAF is a validated oncology target that is clinically relevant in melanoma, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. BGB-3245 has been shown in preclinical models to be effective in inhibiting certain mutant forms of BRAF that currently approved BRAF inhibitors cannot target. A Phase 1 trial for BGB-3245 has been initiated in Australia. \n\n**4. Strong Balance Sheet:** As of the end of 2019, Springworks had \\~$330M in cash and no debt. This is expected to be sufficient to fund operations and support its 6 clinical trials through the end of 2022. The company has not indicated that its clinical development timelines have been impacted by Covid, but we will be on the lookout for any future guidance. \n\n**5. Experienced Leadership:** Springworks is led by a world-class management team with deep pharma industry experience. Selected leadership includes:\n\n* Chief Executive Officer Saqib Islam is a founding member of the company and was formerly the Chief Business Officer at Moderna. Prior to Moderna, he held senior leadership roles at Alexion Pharmaceuticals (a $20B rare disease biotech).\n* Chief Medical Officer Jens Renstrup was formerly Head of Medical Affairs at Alexion, where he was instrumental in building out its pipeline. Prior to Alexion, he led medical affairs at Glaxo Smith Kline\u2019s vaccine division. \n* Head of R&amp;D Stephen Squinto is a venture partner at OrbiMed, a highly respected life science investment firm. He is also a co-founder of Alexion, where he led global operations and R&amp;D for over 20 years. \n\n**6. Risks.** Potential investors should be aware that Springworks is exposed to the following key risks as a biotech company:\n\n* *Clinical development risk.* Springworks\u2019 assets could fail their clinical trials due to unfavorable or uncompetitive clinical data and/or unexpected safety issues. \n* *Competitive risk.* Springworks\u2019 drugs could be leapfrogged by more effective drugs, severely limiting their commercial potential. \n* *Financial risk.* Unexpected costs/circumstances could lead to the company running out of cash and having to raise dilutive capital and/or shut down. \n\nDisclosure: We currently own shares of Springworks Therapeutics.

The earnings calls include: \n\n1. The Walt Disney Company ($DIS) - Tuesday May 5th, 4:30 PM EDT\n2. FLIR Systems, Inc ($FLIR) - Wednesday May 6th, 9:00 AM EDT\n3. Turtle Beach Corporation ($HEAR) - Thursday May 7th, 5:00PM EDT\n\nThe summaries below, are the reasons why I am bullish on these companies for the medium to long-term. \n\n**FLIR Systems ($FLIR):**\n\nThe first company I was to discuss is FLIR. FLIR System has been developing thermal imaging systems since 1978 for use in the avionics industry, because using thermal imaging we can see through total darkness, as well as clouds, fog, etc. Now that we know why they were formed let's look at the current markets for FLIRs technology.\n\n1. US Defense: FLIR currently has many contracts with the US Military and has worked with them for many years. FLIR provides thermal scanning solutions which are used for Border Security, Marine Patrol &amp; Coastal, Search &amp; Rescue, Surveillance, as well as detection of explosives or other harmful substances. Working with the US military provides a revenue stream which continues to drive innovation and continuous improvement on their already market leading tech. I have also attached a link in the video description which shows all the recent FLIR contracts. \n\n[http://investors.flir.com/press-releases?items\\_per\\_page=10&amp;page=0](http://investors.flir.com/press-releases?items_per_page=10&amp;page=0)\n\n1. Autonomous Driving: FLIR has contracts with Vioneer which supports companies such as General Motors, Volkswagen, Audi, Peugeot, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz in their autonomous driving development. This will provide an opportunity for long term growth around the globe. Their thermal sensors are mainly used for Emergency braking systems which is advantageous over many other types of imaging systems for driving in foggy, or reduced visibility conditions. \n2. Health and Safety: As the current COVID-19 pandemic continues more companies announce the importance of thermal scanning being integrated into protection of the public and their workers. As we know with COVID-19, a common symptom of most viral infections is a fever. Thermal imaging can directly detect viral infections but it is an amazing screen tool which can immediately identify those that are high-risk to others. Airports, hospitals, and public markets are already beginning to adopt this technology, however, the growth is endless. This current pandemic has shown us the need for thermal screening and I believe a system like this will be adopted around the globe over the next couple of years. Amazon, Tyson Foods, Intel,  and Ford are just some of the companies which have already begun to implement thermal screening tech in their facilities. \n\nNow I want to take a minute to discuss the company valuation. Before the COVID-19 Pandemic hit FLIR peaked at a market cap of almost 8B, since the all time high its price per share has dropped nearly 40% to just 42.84 at the time of this analysis. It currently has a forward P/E of 18.31 which is slightly above average but a PEG ratio of 0.97 which is awesome especially as I expect the short-term and long-term growth estimates to accelerate. They currently have a revenue approaching 2B annually with a healthy operating margin of approximately 20%. In terms of the balance sheet, they currently have 1.1B in current assets with only 413MM in current liabilities giving them a Current Ratio over 2.5. This company has an average CAGR of 20% per year over the last 20 years not including the dividend it has paid out for the last 10, and I don\u2019t see that changing any time soon. \n\n**Turtle Beach Corp ($HEAR):**\n\nI\u2019m going to start with the reason why Turtle Beach first came onto my radar. After reading *Everybody Lies* by Seth Stephens-Davidowtiz which focuses on the field of data science, I became intrigued of how I could use it in my investing strategies. Now, of course I know data is important in investing, massive companies will use satellite images looking on Tesla factory parking lots to count the inventory levels, but the difference now was that I had access to real time unbiased data using google trends. During the start of lock-down I started to observe trends happening in the real world and used my online resource to see if I could confirm my hypothesis.\n\nI noticed in my friend group and online that there was a sudden interest in gaming due to an increased amount of people being quarantined at home. Now, I knew gaming companies were an obvious beneficiary during the pandemic but what game was everyone playing? Call of Duty Warzone was released on March 10th, 2020 which was almost perfect timing having over 30 million players in under 2 weeks. Call of Duty Warzone was created by Activision Blizzard ($ATVI) but it was a free game, and ATVI was already a $40 billion company so how much could that actually impact the share price in the long-term. Now in first person battle royale games such as Warzone, directional sound is very important to having success in the game. So obviously we can target gaming headset companies. What are the most popular headsets? Astro, Logitech, Turtle Beach are just a couple of the brands of headsets out there but realistically the best way to get direct exposure to such a niche market is through Turtle Beach. Now this was all a hypothesis, let's look at what the data shows.(PS: this is the trend from today, although I originally purchased on March 30th when I was doing these activities)\n\n[Figure 1: Google Trends Relative Search Volume (5 years); xbox headset (blue), gaming headset (red), turtle beach headset (red)](https://imgur.com/a/sWzsUIb) \n\nWe can obviously see this data is quite cyclical with a double peak which occurs the last week of November and the third/fourth week of December every calendar year for obvious reasons. Now we can obviously see there has been a substantial demand in late March and throughout all of April in 2020, peaking higher than the holiday quarter for the first time as far back as the data is available (2004). Can we compare this increased demand to anything else we have seen? If you look closely you can see the slight uptick in demand in Jan/Feb 2018, that was when fortnite went mainstream and peaked in the gaming world. Fortnite is a battle royale game, similar to Warzone in its play-style. How did Turtle Beach ($HEAR) perform during that time? \n\n[Figure 2: Turtle Beach Share Price Q1 and Q2 2018](https://imgur.com/JqxYEwI) \n\nAfter a surprise revenue and eps beat in Q1 of 2018 the share price of Turtle Beach went to a share price of over $30 from a recent low of under $2. Now it is important to notice that the company struggled to maintain this value for the shareholders over time, but the balance sheet was in a much worse position at that time. \n\nSince 2018 the Turtle Beach management team has significantly improved their balance sheet including reducing the debt/equity ratio. They have created strategic partnerships and acquisitions allowing them to gain market share in fast growing areas. As well, they have been able to diversify into PC Gaming instead of purely console. \n\nThe current global demand is great for Turtle Beach in the short to medium-term, as well, the new Xbox and PlayStation is scheduled to be released in Q4 of 2020. With my confidence increasing in the management team I believe this company has a ton of upside potential in the next 3-6 months, possibly longer.

The earnings calls include: \n\n1. The Walt Disney Company ($DIS) - Tuesday May 5th, 4:30 PM EDT\n2. FLIR Systems, Inc ($FLIR) - Wednesday May 6th, 9:00 AM EDT\n3. Turtle Beach Corporation ($HEAR) - Thursday May 7th, 5:00PM EDT\n\nThe summaries below, are the reasons why I am bullish on these companies for the medium to long-term. \n\n**FLIR Systems ($FLIR):**\n\nThe first company I was to discuss is FLIR. FLIR System has been developing thermal imaging systems since 1978 for use in the avionics industry, because using thermal imaging we can see through total darkness, as well as clouds, fog, etc. Now that we know why they were formed let's look at the current markets for FLIRs technology.\n\n1. US Defense: FLIR currently has many contracts with the US Military and has worked with them for many years. FLIR provides thermal scanning solutions which are used for Border Security, Marine Patrol &amp; Coastal, Search &amp; Rescue, Surveillance, as well as detection of explosives or other harmful substances. Working with the US military provides a revenue stream which continues to drive innovation and continuous improvement on their already market leading tech. I have also attached a link in the video description which shows all the recent FLIR contracts. \n\n[http://investors.flir.com/press-releases?items\\_per\\_page=10&amp;page=0](http://investors.flir.com/press-releases?items_per_page=10&amp;page=0)\n\n1. Autonomous Driving: FLIR has contracts with Vioneer which supports companies such as General Motors, Volkswagen, Audi, Peugeot, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz in their autonomous driving development. This will provide an opportunity for long term growth around the globe. Their thermal sensors are mainly used for Emergency braking systems which is advantageous over many other types of imaging systems for driving in foggy, or reduced visibility conditions. \n2. Health and Safety: As the current COVID-19 pandemic continues more companies announce the importance of thermal scanning being integrated into protection of the public and their workers. As we know with COVID-19, a common symptom of most viral infections is a fever. Thermal imaging can directly detect viral infections but it is an amazing screen tool which can immediately identify those that are high-risk to others. Airports, hospitals, and public markets are already beginning to adopt this technology, however, the growth is endless. This current pandemic has shown us the need for thermal screening and I believe a system like this will be adopted around the globe over the next couple of years. Amazon, Tyson Foods, Intel,  and Ford are just some of the companies which have already begun to implement thermal screening tech in their facilities. \n\nNow I want to take a minute to discuss the company valuation. Before the COVID-19 Pandemic hit FLIR peaked at a market cap of almost 8B, since the all time high its price per share has dropped nearly 40% to just 42.84 at the time of this analysis. It currently has a forward P/E of 18.31 which is slightly above average but a PEG ratio of 0.97 which is awesome especially as I expect the short-term and long-term growth estimates to accelerate. They currently have a revenue approaching 2B annually with a healthy operating margin of approximately 20%. In terms of the balance sheet, they currently have 1.1B in current assets with only 413MM in current liabilities giving them a Current Ratio over 2.5. This company has an average CAGR of 20% per year over the last 20 years not including the dividend it has paid out for the last 10, and I don\u2019t see that changing any time soon. \n\n**Turtle Beach Corp ($HEAR):**\n\nI\u2019m going to start with the reason why Turtle Beach first came onto my radar. After reading *Everybody Lies* by Seth Stephens-Davidowtiz which focuses on the field of data science, I became intrigued of how I could use it in my investing strategies. Now, of course I know data is important in investing, massive companies will use satellite images looking on Tesla factory parking lots to count the inventory levels, but the difference now was that I had access to real time unbiased data using google trends. During the start of lock-down I started to observe trends happening in the real world and used my online resource to see if I could confirm my hypothesis.\n\nI noticed in my friend group and online that there was a sudden interest in gaming due to an increased amount of people being quarantined at home. Now, I knew gaming companies were an obvious beneficiary during the pandemic but what game was everyone playing? Call of Duty Warzone was released on March 10th, 2020 which was almost perfect timing having over 30 million players in under 2 weeks. Call of Duty Warzone was created by Activision Blizzard ($ATVI) but it was a free game, and ATVI was already a $40 billion company so how much could that actually impact the share price in the long-term. Now in first person battle royale games such as Warzone, directional sound is very important to having success in the game. So obviously we can target gaming headset companies. What are the most popular headsets? Astro, Logitech, Turtle Beach are just a couple of the brands of headsets out there but realistically the best way to get direct exposure to such a niche market is through Turtle Beach. Now this was all a hypothesis, let's look at what the data shows.(PS: this is the trend from today, although I originally purchased on March 30th when I was doing these activities)\n\n[Figure 1: Google Trends Relative Search Volume (5 years); xbox headset (blue), gaming headset (red), turtle beach headset (red)](https://imgur.com/a/sWzsUIb) \n\nWe can obviously see this data is quite cyclical with a double peak which occurs the last week of November and the third/fourth week of December every calendar year for obvious reasons. Now we can obviously see there has been a substantial demand in late March and throughout all of April in 2020, peaking higher than the holiday quarter for the first time as far back as the data is available (2004). Can we compare this increased demand to anything else we have seen? If you look closely you can see the slight uptick in demand in Jan/Feb 2018, that was when fortnite went mainstream and peaked in the gaming world. Fortnite is a battle royale game, similar to Warzone in its play-style. How did Turtle Beach ($HEAR) perform during that time? \n\n[Figure 2: Turtle Beach Share Price Q1 and Q2 2018](https://imgur.com/JqxYEwI) \n\nAfter a surprise revenue and eps beat in Q1 of 2018 the share price of Turtle Beach went to a share price of over $30 from a recent low of under $2. Now it is important to notice that the company struggled to maintain this value for the shareholders over time, but the balance sheet was in a much worse position at that time. \n\nSince 2018 the Turtle Beach management team has significantly improved their balance sheet including reducing the debt/equity ratio. They have created strategic partnerships and acquisitions allowing them to gain market share in fast growing areas. As well, they have been able to diversify into PC Gaming instead of purely console. \n\nThe current global demand is great for Turtle Beach in the short to medium-term, as well, the new Xbox and PlayStation is scheduled to be released in Q4 of 2020. With my confidence increasing in the management team I believe this company has a ton of upside potential in the next 3-6 months, possibly longer. This is not a play you can just invest in and leave for 20 years though, you must monitor the environment for the gaming industry, pay close attention to the status of the brand among the community, and keep a close eye on the execution of the management team. \n\n**Disney ($DIS):**\n\n\\*Sorry, it's getting late and I do not have time to write my full analysis for Disney however my keynotes are basically what I want to pay attention to on the conference call. Disney has a history of making great investments, and brand loyalty.

DraftKings (DKNG) is a high-growth startup that recently IPO'd through a reverse merger last Friday and saw a 10% increase in value on their first day of trading, ending the day with a market cap of $950M. DKNG's IPO amid the pause of sports during the COVID-19 crisis has some people scratching their heads, but after conducting an opportunity assessment and financial diligence on DKNG, we believe it is a BUY and is well positioned to continue leading online sports betting and also breaking into the online casino space.\n\n   \n \n\nHere's why we think DKNG is well positioned as a growth stock:\n\n   \n \n\n1. DKNG is in close competition with FanDuel for market leadership in U.S. sports betting. When consumers were asked to list companies offering daily fantasy sports and sportsbetting, DKNG was top of mind for a quarter of interviewees while it was the preferred brand for almost a third of consumers. We personally conducted several consumer interviews on their preferred daily fantasy sports and sports betting companies and DKNG ranked top, with consumers citing the platform as more \"user-friendly.\" Furthermore, consumers cited more attractive promotions with better odds offered by DKNG than FanDuel in order to drive user adoption and retention. In a competitive space like this, it's promising that DKNG is focused on customer acquisition and retention.\n\n   \n \n\n2. DKNG is quick to penetrate markets upon online sports betting legalization. DKNG has a track record of moving quick to acquire customers when states legalize online sports betting. For example, DKNG moved quick to win the exclusive bid in New Hampshire and quickly turned online in Pennsylvania when legalization occurred. While DKNG is surely no longer a startup, their talented and driven team is versatile and quick to address make-or-break situations that allow them to take market share quickly. With so many states on the cusp of legalizing online sports betting, it's easy to see upside and growth potential in online sports betting. DKNG is well positioned to take a significant share of that growing market.\n\n   \n \n\n3. DKNG's diverse set of offerings allow them to weather the sports shutdown caused by COVID-19. While DKNG is known for daily fantasy sports and sports betting, it's diversified greatly into e-sports (e.g., League of Legends, Counter-Strike) and online casino (e.g., Blackjack). In the month of March, internet gaming revenue (excluding sports wagers) in New Jersey rose 66% in March, to $65 million. Clearly, while sports are out of commission, DKNG will benefit from the rise in online gambling and the continued interest in e-sports betting. \n\n   \n \n\n4. DKNG is positioned to expand the online casino industry by making online gambling mainstream. Daily fantasy sports and online sports betting is arguably much more mainstream than online casino gambling. Consumers perceive fantasy sports and sports betting to be a skill and information-based game while online casino gambling as sheer luck. DKNG is positioned to link the two together by bringing consumers onto the platform through daily fantasy sports and sports betting and having them dip their toes in the online casino through promos. The adjacency of its sports betting and online casino offerings creates a powerful pipeline that has the opportunity to make online casino gambling more mainstream and DKNG may be at the forefront of it.\n\n   \n \n\n5. The reverse merger provided $500M in cash to DKNG, which will help DKNG through the COVID-19 crisis. In the reverse merger, DKNG has access to $500M in cash, which is enough to cover its average operating costs for approximately 2.5 years. There may be headcount cuts to look out for as they've hired significantly in the past two years and their general &amp; administrative costs has increased almost 100% since last year. However, DKNG's increased cash position with the reverse merger will definitely help it weather through the suspension in sports.\n\n   \n \n\n6. At $20 per share, DKNG is fairly priced compared to its competitors based on its price-to-sales ratio (P/S). DKNG has a P/S of 2.9 compared to Stars Group, FanDuel, and Churchill Downs, which have P/S ratios of 4.1, 3.7, and 2.6 respectively. DKNG is more similar to Stars group and FanDuel given they have more of an online presence and higher growth potential. Churchill Downs on the other hand owns several horse racing tracks and is less poised for growth and therefore has a lower P/S ratio. \n\n   \n \n\nOverall, we perceive DKNG as a buy. It's currently a leader in the space and is well positioned to maintain leadership in the U.S. market with its fast-moving team and diverse offering of games. While COVID-19-driven suspension of sports is concerning, the company has money on hand from the reverse merger IPO and has several revenue streams that are not impacted by the suspension of sports.

Feel free to rip me, or drop an \"atta boy\" -- That's why we're all here!\n\nDisclaimers: I'm not a FA, and don't pretend to be one. New to reddit, but not to the market. Securities I  currently own are **bolded** so you can check my bias. :)\n\nWMT - Talk about a ship that has been steady through the storm. I sold all of mine back in 2016, fearing cuts to entitlement programs would essentially cut their workforce by 30% overnight. Those cuts never came, and now I want back in.  Grocery pickup and delivery has been the future for a while, but COVID seems to have fast tracked that transition. IMO, it will remain highly popular post pandemic, Walmart will expand on it, and 5 years from now &gt;70% of grocery sales will be a direct competition between them and **AMZN**. I'm taking this one as soon as the right opening appears, with the expectation of holding it long term.  \n\n**KO** \\- First share I ever bought, never let it go, added to it over the years, and might be adding more tomorrow.  Not much to say here. It's priced well and has a scheduled earnings report before opening bell on Tues.  The recent relative success of consumer markets (WMT, **AMZN**, **TGT**, COST) leads me to think that will be a positive report, and if I see nothing indicating otherwise, I'll try to stock up and ride the wave.  Big fan of **PEP** as well -- more diversified than **KO**, but KFC/Tacobell/PH will probably slow any aggressive gains for a while.\n\n**MSFT** \\- Grain of salt time. This is my favorite holding on the market, bar none. **MSFT** and **AMZN** have essentially held up the whole average during this rebound period. It's all about those beautiful beautiful clouds y'all. (military contracts don't hurt either, see **BA**...) It's always a good time to buy Microsoft. \n\nGOOG/**GOOGL** \\- has a bright future in similar areas to **MSFT**, but I hate companies that live and die by advertisement revenue. For that reason I have a very limited holding in only 1 out of the 2, and I stay away from FB and TWT as well.  ITS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME TO BUY MICROSOFT.\n\nT and **DAL** \\- like Coke, they both have earnings to report this week. I think Delta will produce a decent report which will confuse some who don't fully understand that the pandemic split quarters, and much of the carnage won't be known until the end of Q2. If it does bump up, I'll offload shares and buy back lower in the early summer. **DAL** has the best balance sheet as well as the second best executive team in the whole airline industry, and I don't see it going anywhere. T on the other hand looks to be primed for injury if they report negative earnings.  If they fall back below 26, I'm an AT&amp;T buyer all day long. \n\nNFLX - If it were my money, I'd wait for the (very likely) record high earnings report coming up, ride the wave, and sell high.

Securities I  currently own are **bolded** so you can check my bias. :)\n\nWMT - Talk about a ship that has been steady through the storm. I sold all of mine back in 2016, fearing cuts to entitlement programs would essentially cut their workforce by 30% overnight. Those cuts never came, and now I want back in.  Grocery pickup and delivery has been the future for a while, but COVID seems to have fast tracked that transition. IMO, it will remain highly popular post pandemic, Walmart will expand on it, and 5 years from now &gt;70% of grocery sales will be a direct competition between them and **AMZN**. I'm taking this one as soon as the right opening appears, with the expectation of holding it long term.  \n\n**KO** \\- First share I ever bought, never let it go, added to it over the years, and might be adding more tomorrow.  Not much to say here. It's priced well and has a scheduled earnings report before opening bell on Tues.  The recent relative success of consumer markets (WMT, **AMZN**, **TGT**, COST) leads me to think that will be a positive report, and if I see nothing indicating otherwise, I'll try to stock up and ride the wave.  Big fan of **PEP** as well -- more diversified than **KO**, but KFC/Tacobell/PH will probably slow any aggressive gains for a while.\n\n**MSFT** \\- Grain of salt time. This is my favorite holding on the market, bar none. **MSFT** and **AMZN** have essentially held up the whole average during this rebound period. It's all about those beautiful beautiful clouds y'all. (military contracts don't hurt either, see **BA**...) It's always a good time to buy Microsoft. \n\nGOOG/**GOOGL** \\- has a bright future in similar areas to **MSFT**, but I hate companies that live and die by advertisement revenue. For that reason I have a very limited holding in only 1 out of the 2, and I stay away from FB and TWT as well.  ITS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME TO BUY MICROSOFT.\n\nT and **DAL** \\- like Coke, they both have earnings to report this week. I think Delta will produce a decent report which will confuse some who don't fully understand that the pandemic split quarters, and much of the carnage won't be known until the end of Q2. If it does bump up, I'll offload shares and buy back lower in the early summer. **DAL** has the best balance sheet as well as the second best executive team in the whole airline industry, and I don't see it going anywhere. T on the other hand looks to be primed for injury if they report negative earnings.  If they fall back below 26, I'm an AT&amp;T buyer all day long. \n\nNFLX - If it were my money, I'd wait for the (very likely) record high earnings report coming up, ride the wave, and sell high.  I'm not a fan of companies who can't seem to be profitable despite overwhelming popularity. Average NFLX account is accessed by &gt;8 users, but only paid for by 1. New competitors emerging.

It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it. \n\nIt's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.\n\n\\- ALPHABET -A-. Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks. \n\n\\- ARISTA NETWORKS. Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.\n\n\\- FACEBOOK. This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy. \n\n\\- GALAPAGOS. To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences. \n\n\\- INCYTE GENOMICS. Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%\n\n\\- LULULEMON ATHLETICA. Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase. \n\n\\- MASTERCARD. Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.\n\n\\- MICROSOFT. No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices. \n\n\\- NVIDIA. Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars. \n\n\\- VEEVA SYSTEMS. One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.\n\nOne last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account.

It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it. \n\nIt's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.\n\n\\- ALPHABET -A-. Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks. \n\n\\- ARISTA NETWORKS. Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.\n\n\\- FACEBOOK. This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy. \n\n\\- GALAPAGOS. To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences. \n\n\\- INCYTE GENOMICS. Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%\n\n\\- LULULEMON ATHLETICA. Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase. \n\n\\- MASTERCARD. Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.\n\n\\- MICROSOFT. No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices. \n\n\\- NVIDIA. Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars. \n\n\\- VEEVA SYSTEMS. One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.\n\nOne last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.\n\nHope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!\n\nTL;DR.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 1,600 points, or 7.7%, to start the week as data showed signs of new U.S. cases slowing. However, it\u2019s too early to determine whether that\u2019s a trend. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 7% on Monday. The Nasdaq rose 7.3%, bringing the index out of a bear market. But the Dow and S&amp;P 500 remained in bear market territory \u2014 declines of at least 20% from 52-week highs. All three stock indexes hit all-time highs in February before states issued stay-at-home orders to fight the spread of the virus and the economy ground to a halt.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Trump, at Monday evening\u2019s White House coronavirus briefing, said, \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d The president said 10 therapeutics are in active trials and some are looking \u201cincredibly successful.\u201d Fifteen other potential treatments are \u201cadvancing rapidly\u201d toward clinical trials, he added. Trump also said, \u201cStay inside and let\u2019s win this and let\u2019s get our country [back] as soon as we can. I think it\u2019s going to be sooner than people think. Things are going really well.\u201d However, at the same briefing, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the world may never get back to what it considered \u201cnormal\u201d before the coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China in December.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * A warning in late January from White House trade advisor Peter Navarro about the potential severity of the coronavirus in America came as the president was publicly playing down the risks. According to The New York Times, Navarro wrote in memos that the outbreak could cost the U.S. trillions of dollars and put millions of Americans at risk of infection or death. Navarro is a leading hardliner in trade talks with China. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said another $1 trillion is needed, beyond the just-passed $2.2 trillion effort. The California Democrat wants another round of direct payments to Americans and more money for companies to keep making payroll. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said in recent days that health care should top the list, signaling his intent to get to work on a new bill.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * World leaders are rallying around U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, wishing him a speedy recovery from the coronavirus. On Monday evening, he was admitted to the intensive care unit at St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital in London after his symptoms worsened. Trump sent his best wishes, saying: \u201cAll Americans are praying for him, he\u2019s a friend of mine, he\u2019s a great gentleman and a great leader.\u201d Johnson announced on March 27 that he tested positive for the coronavirus. He was said to be suffering from \u201cmild symptoms,\u201d but he was hospitalized Sunday evening and moved to the ICU a day later. Johnson\u2019s medical team said the prime minister was conscious and not on a ventilator. Johnson had asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to carry on the prime minister\u2019s duties \u201cwhere necessary.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Britain\u2019s over 52,000 coronavirus cases are among the top 10 nations with the most infections, according to Johns Hopkins University data. However, with 5,385 deaths, the U.K.\u2019s mortality rate was over 10%, second only to Italy\u2019s 12.5% death rate. Italy has the third most infections in the world at over 132,500 but the most deaths at 16,523. The U.S. has the most cases with more than 368,000. The death toll America rose to 10,993. New York state has the most U.S. cases, over 131,800, and the nation\u2019s most deaths, 4,758S. Global cases topped nearly 1.36 million with 75,944 deaths and over 265,500 recoveries.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/NmSSvD9.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NyybhRp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/PWPjWxA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mrxih7p.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/CiSjNJD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($SMPL $CONN $GBX $LEVI $ANGO $RPM $SGH $LNN $MSM $SJR $WDFC $NTIC $EXFO $CAAP $SLP $TLGT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/R9DSwjk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*()*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nN/A.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zuGtqSt.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ydPENYP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7hPwNQF.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xCYyII9.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hsetB9l.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/F9VUitN.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/cMJ0wYy.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* AKER\n* XOM\n* SDOW\n* UGAZ\n* IMMU\n* DAL\n* T\n* CCL\n* APA\n* SPXS\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-kraft-heinz-3m-slack-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Exxon Mobil** \u2013 Exxon Mobil said it was cutting 2020 capital expenditures by 30% and cash operating expenses by 15%, with the moves designed to put it in the strongest possible position when the energy markets improve.\n\n&gt; #**STOCK SYMBOL:** XOM\n\n&gt; * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=XOM&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l)\n\n&gt; ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/XOM)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Slack Technologies** \u2013 The workplace messaging service increased the size of its planned convertible debt offering to $750 million from its originally planned $600 million.

You've badly injured yourself, and can't seen anything in the dark. All you can see is the hole above you, but there seems to be no way to get there. \n\nYour backpack full of supplies is around here somewhere but you can't see a thing. You're panicking because you're quite injured and you don't see a way out of here in any direction. You shout for help but nobody hears you. You have no food or water, and you're in a lot of pain. Your life flashes before your eyes and you think you're going to die alone in here, especially if you don't find that backpack. Night falls and your one source of light disappears. You can't do anything but feel sorry for yourself and hope you don't die overnight.\n\n**Stage 2: The Lifeline**\n\nAround noon the next day, sunlight starts shining directly through the hole, letting in enough light to locate your backpack. You now have a flashlight, a first aid kit for your injuries, a few days supply of food and water. You have some hope you might not die here after all. \n\n**Stage 3: The Bottom**\n\nYou look around and realize, man, this is a massive cave. There's absolutely no way to get back up to the hole you fell from, so you start walking in the hopes of finding another exit. \n\nYou wander around for two days, finding nothing but dead ends and crevasses. Now your food and water is starting to run out and that leg is looking kinda infected. There is just no way out of here. You can't even find your way back to the original place you fell from.  Yet you get a strange feeling you're starting to get use to life in this cave and aren't really panicking anymore. You've started to accept the fact you might actually die in here after all and you're strangely at peace with that.\n\n**Stage 4: The Light at the End of the Tunnel**\n\nThen, in a stroke of luck, you suddenly hear the sound of water in front of you. You limp towards the sound, excitedly and find a beautiful waterfall streaming out of a hole in the top of the cave. You're ecstatic. Not only do you have vital water to sustain you, but a possible way out. Your infected leg is looking pretty bad and it's becoming more difficult to walk, so there's no way you could climb out, but you hope maybe someone knows about the waterfall and will come along and help you. You might still die, but at least there's hope again and a renewed vigor to carry on.\n\n**Stage 5: The Escape**\n\nYou decide to base yourself around this waterfall and explore the nearby tunnels. You haven't found an exit yet, and you're starving, but one day you're shouting \"help!\" to see if anyone can hear you and a face looks down into the hole. It's another hiker. You shout that you're injured and you've been trapped down here for a week or so, and can't find a way out. They throw down a couple candy bars and tell you to hang tight and they'll go find help. A candy bar has never tasted so good in your life.\n\nYou wait a day or so and nobody has come for you. You're starting to panic again that the hiker either lost the way or bailed on you, but you don't want to move from your spot because you're afraid you'll miss the rescuers. Then you hear voices. It's the rescue team. They rapel down and you're lifted out of the cave and into the daylight, where you get airlifted to a hospital. Your leg has to be amputated, but you recover and live a relatively normal life thanks to advances in prosthetics. Pretty soon you're even looking forward to the next hike - but this time you'll be better prepared.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe stimulus and quantitative easing was the backpack that stopped the initial panic and stabilized the situation. Investors at this point have gotten quite used to the cave and at least hear the waterfall even if we haven't seen it with our own eyes yet (promising treatments and rumors of ending the oil war). Things can still go wildly wrong. In this scenario, to some degree survival is out of our control, but we've already accepted the possibility we might be screwed and are clinging to the sound of water to carry us onward because we have nothing to lose.

One of the most highly acclaimed and regarded officially, is by Noble prize winner for economics, Daniel Kahneman. Kahneman has an international bestselling book called Thinking Fast and Slow. The book entails more psychology\\neuroscience material than financial or economical, but to put it briefly, this is what it says: Humans are biologically emotional, and tend to dismiss logical and factual data when analyzing a case, or when making different decisions across their day-to-day lives. When it comes to stock market investing, people disregard numbers that show that only 80% of hedge fund managers outperform the market, and they still give their money to hedge funds in hope that their managers will beat the market \u2013 again, although 80% of them fail. More numbers and figures about how hedge funds V.S stock market play out can be found in the book, The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, by John Bogle, founder and former chief executive of The Vanguard Group. This 250-pages book is completely dedicated to provide numbers of how hedge fund managers fail to beat the market; 98% fail in averaging better than the market over 30 years. So if professionals who had their fair amount of academic education, and a good time gaining experience, can't beat the market, why should you? And so, according to this, the market is unpredictable, and index-funds will always do better.\nNow: Picking Stocks Team. In his book, One Up On Wall Street, Peter Lynch has an interesting explanation why hedge funds fail beating the market. He claims that there are two main reasons behind that: One, hedge funds with billions in capital can't invest in all companies, and the SEC chain them by only allowing them to invest in a little number of companies (sometimes only 40), all of which are large-cap stocks, and since the biggest growth comes from small-cap companies, this restricts them from many chances of picking outperformers. The second reason is that hedge fund analytics are humans, and they want to keep their job in any institution. Investing in smaller companies is risky, and if it happens that their stocks plummet, consequences will be met for the analytic, when in the other hand, if a large company's stocks go down, it will be much more tolerated, and so he chooses to not risk and settle for large companies instead. The claim the Stock Picking Team presents for why individuals can beat the market is: there are many people who do it almost every year. Although most hedge fund managers fail to beat the market, some do it almost every year, Peter Lynch who we had just mentioned did it 14 years in a row. There are also investors who do not belong to any institution, who beat the market for many years in a row. Doesn't that prove that individuals can beat the market? Or is it still sheer luck? There are books of many kinds where the author claims that he has a \"method\" to beat the market, like Peter Lynch and his philosophy of buying stocks of companies you tried and are impressed with, or Minervini's way of spotting upcoming stocks by specific technical and fundamental analysis, or the Gardner brother who claim that they have a method that's beyond fundamental and technical analysis that helped them beat the market, and many others as well\u2026\nI hope many people engage with this since it took me an hour to write it.

There are books of many kinds where the author claims that he has a \"method\" to beat the market, like Peter Lynch and his philosophy of buying stocks of companies you tried and are impressed with, or Minervini's way of spotting upcoming stocks by specific technical and fundamental analysis, or the Gardner brother who claim that they have a method that's beyond fundamental and technical analysis that helped them beat the market, and many others as well\u2026\nI hope many people engage with this since it took me an hour to write it.

MEG's partners have been impacted to varying degrees and recent conversations have shown there is a resolute effort being made to recover quickly from the effects of the outbreak. Currently, there\u00a0are no details available for any government stimulus programs to help the Chinese economy recover from the shutdown, so we are unable to determine what participation opportunities, if any, may be available to Ideanomics and MEG.\n\n**A: Financing / Funding for Fleet Purchasing**\n\nIn September 2018, Ideanomics announced its agreement with First Auto Loan, regarding lease financing and ABS products with a target of raising $6 Billion to fund the lease financing of ride-share vehicles and other types of app-requested taxis. This agreement is currently in progress and will benefit from the capital sourcing referenced below.\n\nIn November and December of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced the creation of multiple funds in association with Dasheng Licheng Lease Financing, with Ideanomics bringing in several high-profile insurance companies to provide large-scale funds to support EV lease financing programs. The final province-level registrations were underway when the outbreak occurred and are now back underway. The impact on bringing these funds to market will now extend into Q2 but should otherwise remain unaffected.\n\nIn November of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced an agreement with China's Yunnan province which included lease financing for the heavy truck segment, with backing by AAA-rated province-specific entities in conjunction with MEG's lease financing programs. The deal also provided for investment into charging station infrastructure, as well as investment into Treeletrik via Yunnan's role as the ASEAN region's belt and road sponsor. The shutdown impacted the timing on this, particularly as it pertained to final registration and approvals at local government, but is expected to be reinstated in the near term.\n\n**B: EV and EV Battery Manufacturing Alliance**\n\nOver the course of the past 18 months or so, Ideanomics, and subsequently MEG, has partnered with leading EV and EV Battery manufacturers, including JAC, Geely, Beijing Foton, CATL, and Yinlong, among others. These partnerships are an important part of the overall offering and assist MEG in offering competitive procurement and order fulfillment. Having best-in-class partners ensures we can meet the needs of fleet operators in terms of vehicle specifications, quality, reliability, and cost and continue to attract large-scale order interest.\n\nAs part of the commencement of activities in Qingdao, we will be showcasing many of these partners at our EV sales hub and anticipate additional manufacturing partners participating based on their value to the overall offering.\n\nWe had begun to implement a joint marketing strategy with select partners, including our participation with CATL in the now postponed EV Mining event in Stockholm, Sweden on March 18-20. It has been tentatively rescheduled until November of this year, due to Coronavirus concerns.\n\n**C. Joint Ventures and Other Strategic and Umbrella Agreements**\n\nIdeanomics and MEG has announced several agreements as either joint ventures, strategic partnerships, or umbrella agreements, which form part of MEG's business development and revenue pipeline development activities. These include deals with the provinces of Inner Mongolia and Yunnan for MEG involvement in supporting the transition to EV mining, which we anticipate will be a significant revenue division for our organization; Zhitong 3000, where we intend to offer their fleet customers' MEG services; activities securing relationships with tourism associations to develop EV tour bus revenues; and more. Each of these is progressing in the normal course of business in the context of earlier sections of this update and, in particular, section A as it pertains to lease financing services.\n\n**D: Sales Agreements for Execution**\n\nIn August of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with iUnicorn, to procure and finance 90,000 taxis for the city of Chengdu, in addition to other cities. In September of 2019, MEG announced the delivery of an additional 4,127 taxis, with confirmation of a further 11,000 to be delivered by the end of 2019. These are subject to the return of local government, to process the final rebate and registration approvals. We anticipate this occurring when the spring temperatures reduce the impact of the outbreak and cities return to normal levels of commerce and the resulting demand for public transportation is restored to pre-outbreak levels.\n\nIn November of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced an order from Yunnan province for 35,000 taxis, and an additional order for 2,300 taxis from the city of Guillin, in Guanxi province. Both of these orders are delayed due to the closure of non-essential local government services, which we anticipate returning to normal in a similar manner to the iUnicorn JV.\n\nIn addition to the sales agreements mentioned above, the MEG team has developed a diverse pipeline of sales orders, with interest and activities in all four of its EV revenue divisions of Heavy Trucks, Buses and Coaches, Logistical Vehicles, and Taxis. In lieu of the lease financing funds availability, MEG has been pursuing bespoke financing for each order, respectively. Furthermore, the recently announced Qingdao sales center activities will help further augment sales going forward.\n\n**E. Global EV Sales Expansion**\n\nIn March of 2019, Ideanomics announced the acquisition of 51% of Malaysia-based EV manufacturer and distributor, Treeletrik. Since the acquisition, Treeletrik has hired an experienced CEO from the automotive industry, increased its sales and after sales operations, upgraded the land secured under the acquisition from leasehold to title holder, secured orders elsewhere in the ASEAN region, and is in negotiations to bring in a number of Chinese EV manufacturing and EV battery partners to help round out its KD and assembly activities such that it can scale its supply operations to ensure order fulfilment.\n\nOutside of Asia, MEG has received some preliminary order inquiries in the Middle East and plans to broadly expand its global footprint once all of its China-based activities are under way.\n\n**F: Energy Sales**\n\nMEG's core strategy is to acquire fleet customers, through offering innovative and cost-efficient transition to EV, such that we transition the consumption of energy from Gasoline and Diesel onto cleaner Electricity. MEG has signed numerous joint venture and strategic partnership agreements to help develop its relationships in this regard and plans to sell both pre-paid electricity at a discount to fleet operators, as well as participate in the lucrative EV charging market. Each of these is valid and in process for normal course of business, with the major highlights detailed below.\n\nIn July of 2019, Ideanomics announced agreements with Three Gorges, to include Tianda Energy and Ding Fang, and Palcan Energy to finance and develop EV fast charging networks. MEG has continued to explore these and other EV fast charging technologies, including those from our EV battery partners, as detailed in the PetroChina update below.\n\nIn September 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with PetroChina, to begin a project to repurpose gas stations to EV fast charging stations, starting with the city of Nanjing. To date, as there is rapidly-evolving technology development in the areas of EV charging and energy management and storage solutions, we are dependent on the certification of new technologies and apparatus for commercial use such that we ensure the most up to date technologies and charging experience are deployed.\n\n**G: Other Financial Services / ABS**\n\nIn August of 2018, Ideanomics announced an agreement with NTC to provide ABS refinancing for buses in several China cities, including Tianjin. Subsequently, Ideanomics announced agreements in January of 2019 with financial institutions to provide financing and other services to support the ABS under the NTC agreement.\n\nThe debt rating of Tianjin at municipal level, along with delayed deliveries from manufacturers, has proved challenging for underwriting and issuance of ABS. In June of 2019, Ideanomics signed an agreement with EV bus and battery manufacturer Yinlong covering both China and Ex-China activities. As Yinlong had already delivered 5.1Billion RMB of manufacturer financed EV buses in Tianjin, outside of the Ideanomics agreement, we began discussions in late Q3 / early Q4 with Yinlong to reorganize the registration and recording of those delivered assets such that they can be compliant with ABS requirements. That activity is underway, albeit it was disrupted and delayed by the Coronavirus activities in the region. Additionally, MEG plans to work closely with Yinlong in 2020 to help support the delivery of additional city bus orders in order to facilitate the ABS refinancing accordingly.\n\nIn June of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with GCL, to include GCL contributing guaranteed sales orders of 500,000 logistical vehicle orders over the next three years. These orders will require financing under the lease financing activities covered in section A, as the original barter-plus-subsidy deal put in place is not being accepted by manufacturers. Several of the small to mid-size orders from the GCL order flow are currently in the pipeline to help develop and streamline the deal expediting process of our lease financing activities.\n\n**About Ideanomics**\n\nIdeanomics (Nasdaq:[IDEX](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2745651-1&amp;h=3461530768&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.ideanomics.com%2F&amp;a=IDEX)) is a global company focused on facilitating the adoption of commercial electric vehicles and developing next generation financial services and Fintech products.\u00a0Its electric vehicle division, Mobile Energy Global (MEG) provides financial services and incentives for commercial fleet operators, including group purchasing discounts and battery buy-back programs, in order to acquire large-scale customers with energy needs which are monetized through pre-paid electricity and EV charging offerings.\u00a0Ideanomics Capital includes DBOT ATS and Intelligenta which provide innovative financial services solutions powered by AI and blockchain.

MEG's partners have been impacted to varying degrees and recent conversations have shown there is a resolute effort being made to recover quickly from the effects of the outbreak. Currently, there\u00a0are no details available for any government stimulus programs to help the Chinese economy recover from the shutdown, so we are unable to determine what participation opportunities, if any, may be available to Ideanomics and MEG.\n\n**A: Financing / Funding for Fleet Purchasing**\n\nIn September 2018, Ideanomics announced its agreement with First Auto Loan, regarding lease financing and ABS products with a target of raising $6 Billion to fund the lease financing of ride-share vehicles and other types of app-requested taxis. This agreement is currently in progress and will benefit from the capital sourcing referenced below.\n\nIn November and December of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced the creation of multiple funds in association with Dasheng Licheng Lease Financing, with Ideanomics bringing in several high-profile insurance companies to provide large-scale funds to support EV lease financing programs. The final province-level registrations were underway when the outbreak occurred and are now back underway. The impact on bringing these funds to market will now extend into Q2 but should otherwise remain unaffected.\n\nIn November of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced an agreement with China's Yunnan province which included lease financing for the heavy truck segment, with backing by AAA-rated province-specific entities in conjunction with MEG's lease financing programs. The deal also provided for investment into charging station infrastructure, as well as investment into Treeletrik via Yunnan's role as the ASEAN region's belt and road sponsor. The shutdown impacted the timing on this, particularly as it pertained to final registration and approvals at local government, but is expected to be reinstated in the near term.\n\n**B: EV and EV Battery Manufacturing Alliance**\n\nOver the course of the past 18 months or so, Ideanomics, and subsequently MEG, has partnered with leading EV and EV Battery manufacturers, including JAC, Geely, Beijing Foton, CATL, and Yinlong, among others. These partnerships are an important part of the overall offering and assist MEG in offering competitive procurement and order fulfillment. Having best-in-class partners ensures we can meet the needs of fleet operators in terms of vehicle specifications, quality, reliability, and cost and continue to attract large-scale order interest.\n\nAs part of the commencement of activities in Qingdao, we will be showcasing many of these partners at our EV sales hub and anticipate additional manufacturing partners participating based on their value to the overall offering.\n\nWe had begun to implement a joint marketing strategy with select partners, including our participation with CATL in the now postponed EV Mining event in Stockholm, Sweden on March 18-20. It has been tentatively rescheduled until November of this year, due to Coronavirus concerns.\n\n**C. Joint Ventures and Other Strategic and Umbrella Agreements**\n\nIdeanomics and MEG has announced several agreements as either joint ventures, strategic partnerships, or umbrella agreements, which form part of MEG's business development and revenue pipeline development activities. These include deals with the provinces of Inner Mongolia and Yunnan for MEG involvement in supporting the transition to EV mining, which we anticipate will be a significant revenue division for our organization; Zhitong 3000, where we intend to offer their fleet customers' MEG services; activities securing relationships with tourism associations to develop EV tour bus revenues; and more. Each of these is progressing in the normal course of business in the context of earlier sections of this update and, in particular, section A as it pertains to lease financing services.\n\n**D: Sales Agreements for Execution**\n\nIn August of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with iUnicorn, to procure and finance 90,000 taxis for the city of Chengdu, in addition to other cities. In September of 2019, MEG announced the delivery of an additional 4,127 taxis, with confirmation of a further 11,000 to be delivered by the end of 2019. These are subject to the return of local government, to process the final rebate and registration approvals. We anticipate this occurring when the spring temperatures reduce the impact of the outbreak and cities return to normal levels of commerce and the resulting demand for public transportation is restored to pre-outbreak levels.\n\nIn November of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced an order from Yunnan province for 35,000 taxis, and an additional order for 2,300 taxis from the city of Guillin, in Guanxi province. Both of these orders are delayed due to the closure of non-essential local government services, which we anticipate returning to normal in a similar manner to the iUnicorn JV.\n\nIn addition to the sales agreements mentioned above, the MEG team has developed a diverse pipeline of sales orders, with interest and activities in all four of its EV revenue divisions of Heavy Trucks, Buses and Coaches, Logistical Vehicles, and Taxis. In lieu of the lease financing funds availability, MEG has been pursuing bespoke financing for each order, respectively. Furthermore, the recently announced Qingdao sales center activities will help further augment sales going forward.\n\n**E. Global EV Sales Expansion**\n\nIn March of 2019, Ideanomics announced the acquisition of 51% of Malaysia-based EV manufacturer and distributor, Treeletrik.

Daily swings like this over a two-week period were only seen at the peak of the financial crisis and in 2011 when U.S. sovereign debt got its first-ever downgrade, the firm said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe message to all investors is that they should expect this volatility to continue. This should be considered the new normal going forward,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped north of 1,000 points twice in the past week, only to erase the quadruple-digit gains in the subsequent sessions. The coronavirus outbreak kept investors on edge as global cases of the infections surpassed 100,000. It\u2019s also spreading rapidly in the U.S. California has declared a state of emergency, while the number of cases in New York reached 33.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cUncertainty breeds greater market volatility,\u201d Keith Lerner, SunTrust\u2019s chief market strategist, said in a note. \u201cMuch is still unknown about how severe and widespread the coronavirus will become. From a market perspective, what we are seeing is uncomfortable but somewhat typical after shock periods.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # More stimulus?\n&gt; So far, the actions from global central banks and governments in response to the outbreak haven\u2019t triggered a sustainable rebound.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis did little to calm investor anxiety. President Donald Trump on Friday signed a sweeping spending bill with an$8.3 billion packageto aid prevention efforts to produce a vaccine for the deadly disease, but stocks extended their heavy rout that day.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is recognizing the global authorities are responding to this,\u201d said Tom Essaye, founder of the Sevens Report. \u201cIf the market begins to worry they are not doing that sufficiently, then I think we are going to go down ugly. It is helping stocks hold up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Essaye said any further stimulus from China and a decent-sized fiscal package from Germany would be positive to the market, but he doesn\u2019t expect the moves to create a huge rebound.\n*****\n&gt; The fed funds future market is now pricing in the possibility of the U.S. central bank cutting by 75 basis points at its March 17-18 meeting.\n*****\n&gt; # Where is the bottom?\n&gt; Many on Wall Street expect the market to fall further before recovering as the health crisis unfolds.\n*****\n&gt; Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief equity strategist, sees a bottom for the S&amp;P 500 in the second quarter after stocks falling as much as 20% from their recent peak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe magnitude of the selloff in the S&amp;P 500 so far has further to go; and in terms of duration, just two weeks in, it is much too early to declare this episode as being done,\u201d Chadha said in a note. \u201cWe do view the impacts on macro and earnings growth as being relatively short-lived and the market eventually looking through them.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Deutsche Bank maintained its year-end target of 3,250 for the S&amp;P 500, which would represent a 10% gain from here and a flat return for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists are also urging patience during this heightened volatility, cautioning against panic selling.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt is during times like these that investors need to maintain a longer-term perspective and stick to their investment process rather than making knee-jerk, binary decisions,\u201d Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qgFoWQB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7eQW0Js.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mFotkBJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/XSXVPJQ.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/deKt8eq.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HYaxtrz.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yygsO0C.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oCNZNbl.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y35bngj.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/E6twMcN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ttAWeD2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Dl7NlBA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A \"Run of the Mill\" Drawdown\n\n&gt; If you're like us, you've heard a lot of people reference the recent equity declines as a sign that the market is pricing in some sort of Armageddon in the US economy. While comments like that make for great soundbites, a little perspective is in order. Since the S&amp;P 500's high on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500 is down 12.8%. In the chart below, we show the S&amp;P 500's annual maximum drawdown by year going back to 1928. In the entire history of the index, the median maximum drawdown from a YTD high is 13.05%. In other words, this year's decline is actually less than normal. Perhaps due to the fact that we have only seen one larger-than-average drawdown in the last eight years is why this one feels so bad.\n\n&gt; The fact that the current decline has only been inline with the historical norm raises a number of questions. For example, if the market has already priced in the worst-case scenario, going out and adding some equity exposure would be a no brainer. However, if we're only in the midst of a 'normal' drawdown in the equity market as the coronavirus outbreak threatens to put the economy into a recession, one could argue that things for the stock market could get worse before they get better, especially when we know that the market can be prone to over-reaction in both directions. The fact is that nobody knows right now how this entire outbreak will play out. If it really is a black swan, the market definitely has further to fall and now would present a great opportunity to sell more equities. However, if it proves to be temporary and after a quarter or two resolves itself and the economy gets back on the path it was on at the start of the year, then the magnitude of the current decline is probably appropriate. As they say, that's what makes a market!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Drawdowns.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Long-Term Treasuries Go Haywire\n\n&gt; Take a good luck at today's moves in long-term US Treasury yields, because chances are you won't see moves of this magnitude again soon. Let's start with the yield on the 30-year US Treasury. Today's decline of 29 basis points in the yield will go down as the largest one-day decline in the yield on the 30-year since 2009. For some perspective, there have only been 25 other days since 1977 where the yield saw a larger one day decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; That doesn't even tell the whole story, though. As shown in the chart below, every other time the yield saw a sharper one-day decline, the actual yield of the 30-year was much higher, and in most other cases it was much, much higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Yield.png))**\n\n&gt; To show this another way, the percentage change in the yield on the 30-year has never been seen before, and it's not even close. Now, before the chart crime police come calling, we realize showing a percentage change of a percentage is not the most accurate representation, but we wanted to show this for illustrative purposes only.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Percent-change-in-yield.png))**\n\n&gt; Finally, with long-term interest rates plummetting we wanted to provide an update on the performance of the Austrian 100-year bond. That's now back at record highs, begging the question, why is the US not flooding the market with long-term debt?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Austria.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It Doesn't Get Much Worse Than This For Crude Oil\n\n&gt; Crude oil prices are down close to 10% today in what is shaping up to be the worst day for crude oil since late 2014. That's more than five years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-Daily-Changes.png))**\n\n&gt; Today's decline is pretty much a continuation of what has been a one-way trade for the commodity ever since the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani. The last time prices were this low was around Christmas 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil.png))**\n\n&gt; With today's decline, crude oil is now off to its worst start to a year in a generation falling 32%. Since 1984, the only other year that was worse was 1986 when the year started out with a decline of 50% through March 6th. If you're looking for a bright spot, in 1986, prices rose 36% over the remainder of the year. The only other year where crude oil kicked off the year with a 30% decline was in 1991 after the first Iraq war. Over the remainder of that year, prices rose a more modest 5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-YTD-Starts.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Year Treasury Yield Breaks Below 1%\n\n&gt; Despite strong market gains on Wednesday, March 4, 2020, the on-the-run 10-year Treasury yield ended the day below 1% for the first time ever and has posted additional declines in real time, sitting at 0.92% intraday as this blog is being written. \u201cThe decline in yields has been remarkable,\u201d said LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe 10-year Treasury yield has dipped below 1%, and today\u2019s declines are likely to make the recent run lower the largest decline of the cycle.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in LPL Research\u2019s chart of the day, the current decline in the 10-year Treasury yield without a meaningful reversal (defined as at least 0.75%) is approaching the decline seen in 2011 and 2012 and would need about another two months to be the longest decline in length of time. At the same time, no prior decline has lasted forever and a pattern of declines and increases has been normal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-chart-3.5.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield lower?\n\n&gt; * A shrinking but still sizable yield advantage over other developed market sovereign debt\n&gt; * Added stock volatility if downside risks to economic growth from the coronavirus increase\n&gt; * A larger potential premium over shorter-term yields if the Federal Reserve aggressively cuts interest rates\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield higher?\n\n&gt; * A second half economic rebound acting a catalyst for a Treasury sell-off\n&gt; * As yields move lower, investors may increasingly seek more attractive sources of income\n&gt; * Any dollar weakness could lead to some selling by international investors\n&gt; * Longer maturity Treasuries are looking like an increasingly crowded trade, potentially adding energy to any sell-off\n\n&gt; On balance, our view remains that the prospect of an economic rebound over the second half points to the potential for interest rates moving higher. At the same time, we still see some advantage in the potential diversification benefits of intermediate maturity high-quality bonds, especially during periods of market stress. We continue to recommend that suitable investors consider keeping a bond portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates below that of the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index by emphasizing short to intermediate maturity bonds, but do not believe it\u2019s time to pile into very short maturities despite the 10-year Treasury yield sitting at historically low levels.\n\n*****\n\n# U.S. Jobs Growth Marches On\n\n&gt; While stock markets continue to be extremely volatile as they come to terms with how the coronavirus may affect global growth, the U.S. job market has remained remarkably robust. Continued U.S. jobs data resilience in the face of headwinds from the coronavirus outbreak may be a key factor in prolonging the expansion, given how important the strength of the U.S. consumer has been late into this expansion.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Department of Labor today reported that U.S. nonfarm payroll data had a strong showing of 273,000 jobs added in February, topping the expectation of every Bloomberg-surveyed economist, with an additional upward revision of 85,000 additional jobs for December 2019 and January 2020. This has brought the current unemployment rate back to its 50-year low of 3.5%. So far, it appears it\u2019s too soon for any effects of the coronavirus to have been felt in the jobs numbers. (Note: The survey takes place in the middle of each month.)\n\n&gt; On Wednesday, ADP released its private payroll data (excluding government jobs), which increased by 183,000 in February, also handily beating market expectations. Most of these jobs were added in the service sector, with 44,000 added in the leisure and hospitality sector, and another 31,000 in trade/transportation/utilities. Both of these areas could be at risk of potential cutbacks if consumers start to avoid eating out or other leisure pursuits due to coronavirus fears.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, payrolls remain strong, and any effects of the virus outbreaks most likely would be felt in coming months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/US-Jobs-Data.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFebruary\u2019s jobs report shows the 113th straight month that the U.S. jobs market has grown,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s an incredible run and highlights how the U.S. consumer has become key to extending the expansion, especially given setbacks to global growth from the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d\n\n&gt; While there is bound to be some drag on future jobs data from the coronavirus-related slowdown, we would anticipate that the effects of this may be transitory. We believe economic fundamentals continue to suggest the possibility of a second-half-of-the\u2013year economic rebound.\n\n*****\n\n# Down January &amp; Down February: S&amp;P 500 Posts Full-Year Gain Just 43.75% of Time\n\n&gt; The combination of a down January and a down February has come about 17 times, including this year, going back to 1950. Rest of the year and full-year performance has taken a rather sizable hit following the previous 16 occurrences. March through December S&amp;P 500 average performance drops to 2.32% compared to 7.69% in all years. Full-year performance is even worse with S&amp;P 500 average turning to a loss of 4.91% compared to an average gain of 9.14% in all years. All hope for 2020 is not lost as seven of the 16 past down January and down February years did go on to log gains over the last 10 months and full year while six enjoyed double-digit gains from March to December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/781e034df22d242349ff3f8882653cec/b4f07d98317a2635-4d/s500x750/0ea61b1c01085e74593633995acba59fe8a96ce8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Take Caution After Emergency Rate Cut\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s big rally was an encouraging sign that the markets are becoming more comfortable with the public health, monetary and political handling of the situation. But the history of these \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201csurprise\u201d rate cuts by the Fed between meetings suggest some caution remains in order.\n\n&gt; The table here shows that these surprise cuts between meetings have really only \u201cworked\u201d once in the past 20+ years. In 1998 when the Fed and the plunge protection team acted swiftly and in a coordinated manner to stave off the fallout from the financial crisis caused by the collapse of the Russian ruble and the highly leveraged Long Term Capital Management hedge fund markets responded well. This was not the case during the extended bear markets of 2001-2002 and 2007-2009.\n\n&gt; Bottom line: if this is a short-term impact like the 1998 financial crisis the market should recover sooner rather than later. But if the economic impact of coronavirus virus is prolonged, the market is more likely to languish.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd9ae8723eaf077f8baa56e384c8d8f7/e543b6eee32cdf93-81/s500x750/0f2b63108953c1e4cfb97da0a979d4ab3651cdeb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$DKS**\n&gt; * **$AVGO** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$WORK** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$DOCU** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$CLDR** \n&gt; * **$INSG** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$BTAI** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$HEAR** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$ADDYY** \n&gt; * **$GPS** \n&gt; * **$AKBA** \n&gt; * **$PDD** \n&gt; * **$CYOU** \n&gt; * **$FNV** \n&gt; * **$MTNB** \n&gt; * **$NERV** \n&gt; * **$MTN** \n&gt; * **$BEST** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$NINE** \n&gt; * **$AZUL** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$PRPL** \n&gt; * **$VSLR** \n&gt; * **$KLZE** \n&gt; * **$ZUO** \n&gt; * **$DVAX** \n&gt; * **$EXPR** \n&gt; * **$VRA** \n&gt; * **$AXSM** \n&gt; * **$CDMO** \n&gt; * **$CASY**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MY5URDI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Fq1ixYG.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3QxCDMd.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/kG5Cja7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWb2ADY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SH8bsTn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PH2Inly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RToRF8p.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HECD2g3.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvEJ9Vw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $336.77\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

Daily swings like this over a two-week period were only seen at the peak of the financial crisis and in 2011 when U.S. sovereign debt got its first-ever downgrade, the firm said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe message to all investors is that they should expect this volatility to continue. This should be considered the new normal going forward,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped north of 1,000 points twice in the past week, only to erase the quadruple-digit gains in the subsequent sessions.

President Donald Trump on Friday signed a sweeping spending bill with an$8.3 billion packageto aid prevention efforts to produce a vaccine for the deadly disease, but stocks extended their heavy rout that day.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is recognizing the global authorities are responding to this,\u201d said Tom Essaye, founder of the Sevens Report. \u201cIf the market begins to worry they are not doing that sufficiently, then I think we are going to go down ugly. It is helping stocks hold up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Essaye said any further stimulus from China and a decent-sized fiscal package from Germany would be positive to the market, but he doesn\u2019t expect the moves to create a huge rebound.\n*****\n&gt; The fed funds future market is now pricing in the possibility of the U.S. central bank cutting by 75 basis points at its March 17-18 meeting.\n*****\n&gt; # Where is the bottom?\n&gt; Many on Wall Street expect the market to fall further before recovering as the health crisis unfolds.\n*****\n&gt; Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief equity strategist, sees a bottom for the S&amp;P 500 in the second quarter after stocks falling as much as 20% from their recent peak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe magnitude of the selloff in the S&amp;P 500 so far has further to go; and in terms of duration, just two weeks in, it is much too early to declare this episode as being done,\u201d Chadha said in a note. \u201cWe do view the impacts on macro and earnings growth as being relatively short-lived and the market eventually looking through them.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Deutsche Bank maintained its year-end target of 3,250 for the S&amp;P 500, which would represent a 10% gain from here and a flat return for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists are also urging patience during this heightened volatility, cautioning against panic selling.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt is during times like these that investors need to maintain a longer-term perspective and stick to their investment process rather than making knee-jerk, binary decisions,\u201d Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qgFoWQB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7eQW0Js.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mFotkBJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/XSXVPJQ.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/deKt8eq.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HYaxtrz.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yygsO0C.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oCNZNbl.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y35bngj.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/E6twMcN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ttAWeD2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Dl7NlBA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A \"Run of the Mill\" Drawdown\n\n&gt; If you're like us, you've heard a lot of people reference the recent equity declines as a sign that the market is pricing in some sort of Armageddon in the US economy. While comments like that make for great soundbites, a little perspective is in order. Since the S&amp;P 500's high on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500 is down 12.8%. In the chart below, we show the S&amp;P 500's annual maximum drawdown by year going back to 1928. In the entire history of the index, the median maximum drawdown from a YTD high is 13.05%. In other words, this year's decline is actually less than normal. Perhaps due to the fact that we have only seen one larger-than-average drawdown in the last eight years is why this one feels so bad.\n\n&gt; The fact that the current decline has only been inline with the historical norm raises a number of questions. For example, if the market has already priced in the worst-case scenario, going out and adding some equity exposure would be a no brainer. However, if we're only in the midst of a 'normal' drawdown in the equity market as the coronavirus outbreak threatens to put the economy into a recession, one could argue that things for the stock market could get worse before they get better, especially when we know that the market can be prone to over-reaction in both directions. The fact is that nobody knows right now how this entire outbreak will play out. If it really is a black swan, the market definitely has further to fall and now would present a great opportunity to sell more equities. However, if it proves to be temporary and after a quarter or two resolves itself and the economy gets back on the path it was on at the start of the year, then the magnitude of the current decline is probably appropriate. As they say, that's what makes a market!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Drawdowns.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Long-Term Treasuries Go Haywire\n\n&gt; Take a good luck at today's moves in long-term US Treasury yields, because chances are you won't see moves of this magnitude again soon. Let's start with the yield on the 30-year US Treasury. Today's decline of 29 basis points in the yield will go down as the largest one-day decline in the yield on the 30-year since 2009. For some perspective, there have only been 25 other days since 1977 where the yield saw a larger one day decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; That doesn't even tell the whole story, though. As shown in the chart below, every other time the yield saw a sharper one-day decline, the actual yield of the 30-year was much higher, and in most other cases it was much, much higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Yield.png))**\n\n&gt; To show this another way, the percentage change in the yield on the 30-year has never been seen before, and it's not even close. Now, before the chart crime police come calling, we realize showing a percentage change of a percentage is not the most accurate representation, but we wanted to show this for illustrative purposes only.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Percent-change-in-yield.png))**\n\n&gt; Finally, with long-term interest rates plummetting we wanted to provide an update on the performance of the Austrian 100-year bond. That's now back at record highs, begging the question, why is the US not flooding the market with long-term debt?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Austria.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It Doesn't Get Much Worse Than This For Crude Oil\n\n&gt; Crude oil prices are down close to 10% today in what is shaping up to be the worst day for crude oil since late 2014. That's more than five years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-Daily-Changes.png))**\n\n&gt; Today's decline is pretty much a continuation of what has been a one-way trade for the commodity ever since the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani. The last time prices were this low was around Christmas 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil.png))**\n\n&gt; With today's decline, crude oil is now off to its worst start to a year in a generation falling 32%. Since 1984, the only other year that was worse was 1986 when the year started out with a decline of 50% through March 6th. If you're looking for a bright spot, in 1986, prices rose 36% over the remainder of the year. The only other year where crude oil kicked off the year with a 30% decline was in 1991 after the first Iraq war. Over the remainder of that year, prices rose a more modest 5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/030620-Crude-Oil-YTD-Starts.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Year Treasury Yield Breaks Below 1%\n\n&gt; Despite strong market gains on Wednesday, March 4, 2020, the on-the-run 10-year Treasury yield ended the day below 1% for the first time ever and has posted additional declines in real time, sitting at 0.92% intraday as this blog is being written. \u201cThe decline in yields has been remarkable,\u201d said LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe 10-year Treasury yield has dipped below 1%, and today\u2019s declines are likely to make the recent run lower the largest decline of the cycle.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in LPL Research\u2019s chart of the day, the current decline in the 10-year Treasury yield without a meaningful reversal (defined as at least 0.75%) is approaching the decline seen in 2011 and 2012 and would need about another two months to be the longest decline in length of time. At the same time, no prior decline has lasted forever and a pattern of declines and increases has been normal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-chart-3.5.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield lower?\n\n&gt; * A shrinking but still sizable yield advantage over other developed market sovereign debt\n&gt; * Added stock volatility if downside risks to economic growth from the coronavirus increase\n&gt; * A larger potential premium over shorter-term yields if the Federal Reserve aggressively cuts interest rates\n\n&gt; What are some things that can push the 10-year Treasury yield higher?\n\n&gt; * A second half economic rebound acting a catalyst for a Treasury sell-off\n&gt; * As yields move lower, investors may increasingly seek more attractive sources of income\n&gt; * Any dollar weakness could lead to some selling by international investors\n&gt; * Longer maturity Treasuries are looking like an increasingly crowded trade, potentially adding energy to any sell-off\n\n&gt; On balance, our view remains that the prospect of an economic rebound over the second half points to the potential for interest rates moving higher. At the same time, we still see some advantage in the potential diversification benefits of intermediate maturity high-quality bonds, especially during periods of market stress. We continue to recommend that suitable investors consider keeping a bond portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to changes in interest rates below that of the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index by emphasizing short to intermediate maturity bonds, but do not believe it\u2019s time to pile into very short maturities despite the 10-year Treasury yield sitting at historically low levels.\n\n*****\n\n# U.S. Jobs Growth Marches On\n\n&gt; While stock markets continue to be extremely volatile as they come to terms with how the coronavirus may affect global growth, the U.S. job market has remained remarkably robust. Continued U.S. jobs data resilience in the face of headwinds from the coronavirus outbreak may be a key factor in prolonging the expansion, given how important the strength of the U.S. consumer has been late into this expansion.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Department of Labor today reported that U.S. nonfarm payroll data had a strong showing of 273,000 jobs added in February, topping the expectation of every Bloomberg-surveyed economist, with an additional upward revision of 85,000 additional jobs for December 2019 and January 2020. This has brought the current unemployment rate back to its 50-year low of 3.5%. So far, it appears it\u2019s too soon for any effects of the coronavirus to have been felt in the jobs numbers. (Note: The survey takes place in the middle of each month.)\n\n&gt; On Wednesday, ADP released its private payroll data (excluding government jobs), which increased by 183,000 in February, also handily beating market expectations. Most of these jobs were added in the service sector, with 44,000 added in the leisure and hospitality sector, and another 31,000 in trade/transportation/utilities. Both of these areas could be at risk of potential cutbacks if consumers start to avoid eating out or other leisure pursuits due to coronavirus fears.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, payrolls remain strong, and any effects of the virus outbreaks most likely would be felt in coming months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/US-Jobs-Data.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFebruary\u2019s jobs report shows the 113th straight month that the U.S. jobs market has grown,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s an incredible run and highlights how the U.S. consumer has become key to extending the expansion, especially given setbacks to global growth from the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d\n\n&gt; While there is bound to be some drag on future jobs data from the coronavirus-related slowdown, we would anticipate that the effects of this may be transitory. We believe economic fundamentals continue to suggest the possibility of a second-half-of-the\u2013year economic rebound.\n\n*****\n\n# Down January &amp; Down February: S&amp;P 500 Posts Full-Year Gain Just 43.75% of Time\n\n&gt; The combination of a down January and a down February has come about 17 times, including this year, going back to 1950. Rest of the year and full-year performance has taken a rather sizable hit following the previous 16 occurrences. March through December S&amp;P 500 average performance drops to 2.32% compared to 7.69% in all years.

But the history of these \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201csurprise\u201d rate cuts by the Fed between meetings suggest some caution remains in order.\n\n&gt; The table here shows that these surprise cuts between meetings have really only \u201cworked\u201d once in the past 20+ years. In 1998 when the Fed and the plunge protection team acted swiftly and in a coordinated manner to stave off the fallout from the financial crisis caused by the collapse of the Russian ruble and the highly leveraged Long Term Capital Management hedge fund markets responded well. This was not the case during the extended bear markets of 2001-2002 and 2007-2009.\n\n&gt; Bottom line: if this is a short-term impact like the 1998 financial crisis the market should recover sooner rather than later. But if the economic impact of coronavirus virus is prolonged, the market is more likely to languish.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd9ae8723eaf077f8baa56e384c8d8f7/e543b6eee32cdf93-81/s500x750/0f2b63108953c1e4cfb97da0a979d4ab3651cdeb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$DKS**\n&gt; * **$AVGO** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$WORK** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$DOCU** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$CLDR** \n&gt; * **$INSG** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$BTAI** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$HEAR** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$ADDYY** \n&gt; * **$GPS** \n&gt; * **$AKBA** \n&gt; * **$PDD** \n&gt; * **$CYOU** \n&gt; * **$FNV** \n&gt; * **$MTNB** \n&gt; * **$NERV** \n&gt; * **$MTN** \n&gt; * **$BEST** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$NINE** \n&gt; * **$AZUL** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$PRPL** \n&gt; * **$VSLR** \n&gt; * **$KLZE** \n&gt; * **$ZUO** \n&gt; * **$DVAX** \n&gt; * **$EXPR** \n&gt; * **$VRA** \n&gt; * **$AXSM** \n&gt; * **$CDMO** \n&gt; * **$CASY**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/4OOLYTY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MY5URDI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Fq1ixYG.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3QxCDMd.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/kG5Cja7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWb2ADY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SH8bsTn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PH2Inly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RToRF8p.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HECD2g3.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BvEJ9Vw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $336.77\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

(NYSE: SPCE) (\u201cVirgin Galactic\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d), a vertically integrated aerospace company, has successfully completed another vital step on its path to commercial service, relocating SpaceShipTwo,VSS Unity, to its commercial headquarters at Spaceport America\u2019s Gateway to Space building.\n\nVSS Unity, attached to the carrier aircraft, VMS Eve, made the journey from Mojave, California, where the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities are based. The vehicle landed at 15:49 MT, where it was greeted by an enthusiastic group of teammates who will operate the spaceship in New Mexico.\n\nThis captive carry flight provided an opportunity for engineers to evaluate VSSUnity for over three hours at high altitude and cold temperatures, a longer period of time than is experienced during missions to space. These environmental evaluations of system performance are difficult to replicate at ground level, making captive carry missions a vital component of VSS Unity\u2019s flight test plan.\n\nThe flight also provided a valuable opportunity to conduct pilot training and familiarization, with veteran Italian Air Force Test Pilot Nicola \u2018Stick\u2019 Pecile joining Chief Pilot Dave \u2018Mac\u2019 Mackay in the cockpit of the spaceship for the first time. Nicola is the fifth pilot to complete a flight in VSS Unity. VMS Eve was piloted by Mike \u2018Sooch\u2019 Masucci and Frederick \u2018CJ\u2019 Sturckow.\n\nThe move of the spaceship to Spaceport America marks a key step in the relocation of Virgin Galactic\u2019s to the state of New Mexico. In May 2019, Virgin Galactic announced that as part of this move, approximately 100 teammates would move to New Mexico from Mojave, California, Spaceport America would become operational and the vehicles would be transferred to the Gateway to Space. Today, nearly all of those team members have relocated, the spaceport is operationally ready, and both VMS Eve and VSS Unity have now arrived. Of Virgin Galactic\u2019s total current New Mexico work force, more than 70 team members have been hired locally, the result of a conscious effort to attract New Mexico-based talent.\n\n\u201cNew Mexico is going to be the world\u2019s launchpad for commercial spaceflight,\u201d New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said. \u201cToday marks another step closer: We will have a genuine Space Valley in Southern New Mexico, a hotbed of innovation and achievement and space tourism development. I congratulate Virgin Galactic\u2019s workers, George Whitesides and Sir Richard Branson on today\u2019s successful flight \u2013 and once again I say to them: Welcome to New Mexico, we\u2019re very glad to have you!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Virgin Galactic started moving to New Mexico last year, everyone felt the sheer magnitude of the task ahead, but we were encouraged and excited by the team\u2019s confidence and strong vision for the future,\u201d said George Whitesides, CEO of Virgin Galactic. \u201cToday we realized the next step in that dream by bringing our beautiful spaceship to New Mexico. We still have significant work ahead, but we are grateful to all our teammates who have made this day a reality.\u201d\n\nThe relocation of VSS Unity to Spaceport America enables the Company to engage in the final stages of its flight test program. This will begin with a number of initial captive carry and glide flights from the new operating base in New Mexico, allowing the spaceflight operations team to familiarize themselves with the airspace and ground control. Once these tests are complete, the team will carry out a number of rocket-powered test flights from Spaceport America to continue the evaluation of VSS Unity\u2019s performance. During this phase, the final spaceship cabin and customer experience evaluations will also be concluded in preparation for the start of commercial spaceflight operations.\n\nThe Spaceship Company, Virgin Galactic\u2019s design, testing and manufacturing arm, remains firmly rooted in Mojave, California. While VMS Eve and VSS Unity are now based in New Mexico, they will make periodic journeys back to Mojave to support ground and flight tests of new spaceships, as well as for vehicle maintenance and upgrade activities.

(NYSE: SPCE) (\u201cVirgin Galactic\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d), a vertically integrated aerospace company, has successfully completed another vital step on its path to commercial service, relocating SpaceShipTwo,VSS Unity, to its commercial headquarters at Spaceport America\u2019s Gateway to Space building.\n\nVSS Unity, attached to the carrier aircraft, VMS Eve, made the journey from Mojave, California, where the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities are based. The vehicle landed at 15:49 MT, where it was greeted by an enthusiastic group of teammates who will operate the spaceship in New Mexico.\n\nThis captive carry flight provided an opportunity for engineers to evaluate VSSUnity for over three hours at high altitude and cold temperatures, a longer period of time than is experienced during missions to space. These environmental evaluations of system performance are difficult to replicate at ground level, making captive carry missions a vital component of VSS Unity\u2019s flight test plan.\n\nThe flight also provided a valuable opportunity to conduct pilot training and familiarization, with veteran Italian Air Force Test Pilot Nicola \u2018Stick\u2019 Pecile joining Chief Pilot Dave \u2018Mac\u2019 Mackay in the cockpit of the spaceship for the first time. Nicola is the fifth pilot to complete a flight in VSS Unity. VMS Eve was piloted by Mike \u2018Sooch\u2019 Masucci and Frederick \u2018CJ\u2019 Sturckow.\n\nThe move of the spaceship to Spaceport America marks a key step in the relocation of Virgin Galactic\u2019s to the state of New Mexico. In May 2019, Virgin Galactic announced that as part of this move, approximately 100 teammates would move to New Mexico from Mojave, California, Spaceport America would become operational and the vehicles would be transferred to the Gateway to Space. Today, nearly all of those team members have relocated, the spaceport is operationally ready, and both VMS Eve and VSS Unity have now arrived. Of Virgin Galactic\u2019s total current New Mexico work force, more than 70 team members have been hired locally, the result of a conscious effort to attract New Mexico-based talent.\n\n\u201cNew Mexico is going to be the world\u2019s launchpad for commercial spaceflight,\u201d New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said. \u201cToday marks another step closer: We will have a genuine Space Valley in Southern New Mexico, a hotbed of innovation and achievement and space tourism development. I congratulate Virgin Galactic\u2019s workers, George Whitesides and Sir Richard Branson on today\u2019s successful flight \u2013 and once again I say to them: Welcome to New Mexico, we\u2019re very glad to have you!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Virgin Galactic started moving to New Mexico last year, everyone felt the sheer magnitude of the task ahead, but we were encouraged and excited by the team\u2019s confidence and strong vision for the future,\u201d said George Whitesides, CEO of Virgin Galactic. \u201cToday we realized the next step in that dream by bringing our beautiful spaceship to New Mexico. We still have significant work ahead, but we are grateful to all our teammates who have made this day a reality.\u201d\n\nThe relocation of VSS Unity to Spaceport America enables the Company to engage in the final stages of its flight test program. This will begin with a number of initial captive carry and glide flights from the new operating base in New Mexico, allowing the spaceflight operations team to familiarize themselves with the airspace and ground control. Once these tests are complete, the team will carry out a number of rocket-powered test flights from Spaceport America to continue the evaluation of VSS Unity\u2019s performance. During this phase, the final spaceship cabin and customer experience evaluations will also be concluded in preparation for the start of commercial spaceflight operations.\n\nThe Spaceship Company, Virgin Galactic\u2019s design, testing and manufacturing arm, remains firmly rooted in Mojave, California. While VMS Eve and VSS Unity are now based in New Mexico, they will make periodic journeys back to Mojave to support ground and flight tests of new spaceships, as well as for vehicle maintenance and upgrade activities. There is significant progress being made on the next two spaceships, including achieving the Weight on Wheels milestone for the second spaceship and completing over 50% of the structural and system part fabrication for the third spaceship, which were announced in January.\n\nDan Hicks, Spaceport America\u2019s Executive Director, congratulated the Virgin Galactic team, saying, \u201cThis truly is the dawn of a new era for the commercial space sector.

(HOLI)** \n\nHOLI is a leading provider of automation and systems solutions in China, with overseas operations in eight other countries throughout Asia. The majority of its business is done in the industrial automation (IA) and rail transportation sectors, though it has low-margin operations in mechanical &amp; electrical (M&amp;E) and medical solutions as well. A miniscule debt-to-equity ratio, healthy historical cash flows, promising growth based on planned expansion in relevant sectors, and the Great Wall of China doubling as an economic moat all suggest taking a long position while the stock price hovers near its 52-week low. \n\n***Business Profile***\n\nFounded in 1993 and listed on NASDAQ since 2008, HOLI has grown from research team specializing in automation control in the power industry to a multinational company with customers in sectors including power, petrochemical, high-speed rail, and urban rail. In IA, HOLI provides automation hardware, software, and services spanning field devices, control systems, enterprise manufacturing management and cloud-based applications. In rail transportation, it provides advanced signaling control and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems for high-speed rail and urban rail. \n\nHOLI designs and manufactures all its products in-house at its facilities in Beijing and Hangzhou. Its core hardware is a printed circuit board, manufactured and assembled at the two Chinese facilities. Raw materials include bare printed circuit boards and various electronic components needed for assembly. \n\nApproximately 82% of the company\u2019s total consolidated revenues are derived from integrated solutions contracts won through the bid process. The remainder of revenue is generated through sales of spare parts, maintenance, and training services after the warranty period from the contracts has ended. \n\nOk, I kind of get it. So why should I be interested?\n\n1. **An Impeccable Balance Sheet:** After paying off its 20M convertible bond in Q1 of FY20, the company has total debt of only 2.5M. That\u2019s good for a D/E ratio of 0.003, quite a bit lower than the 0.557 average of its competitors. It\u2019s average OCF margin over the last three years is 19%, well above industry averages, and its average CFO/NI ratio over the same period is 0.99.\n2. **Urbanization:** Rapid industrialization and warped demographics has manifested in dramatic urbanization and economic integration, which in turn creates a critical need for infrastructure. Grand infrastructure goals are what a planned economy like China does best. While the world awaits the details of the PRC\u2019s 14th Five Year Plan, you can bet HOLI will be busy servicing Chinese needs for high-speed rail and subway transit.\n3. **Limited Domestic Competition:** While large multinationals account for the majority of global automation market share, to the extent this is true in China does not extend to the verticals in which Hollysys makes most of its profits. Specifically, the high barriers to entry for servicing nuclear power plants and high-speed rail gives the company an enviable moat around a significant portion of its revenue share. \n\n***Valuation***\n\nCurrently, HOLI\u2019s sustainable competitive advantage comes from its specialized offerings of high-speed rail signaling systems to ensure the safety of passenger train movement. The China Train Control System (CTCS) is a country specific high-speed rail standard and therefore is different from international standards propounded by European organizations or Japan. This barrier to entry makes HOLI the largest provider in a growing market. In fact, their 39% market share from 2015-2018 for total automatic train protection (ATP) sets sold made them the largest Chinese company in the domestic automation market. Rail is also the division in which the company has its highest profit margins.\n\nHOLI\u2019s revenue comes from three main offerings: IA, Rail, and M&amp;E. Historically, the revenue share between the three divisions has been very stable: 40%, 36%, and 23%, respectively. In 2019 and 2018, the company had a GP% of 37% and 38%. Over those two years, IA posted a GP% of 41% and 40% while Rail posted a GP% of 48% and 52%. M&amp;E were by far its lowest margin operations with a GP% of 13% both years. The company does not provide revenue figures by geographical area for each division, but it does break out total revenues by geographical area. We can infer from this breakout and from other financial and marketing materials that almost all IA and Rail revenue is derived from business in the PRC while M&amp;E revenue is generated from its foreign subsidiaries in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Middle East. \n\nChina\u2019s high-speed railway operating mileage, currently the largest in the world, has grown from 19,000km in 2016 to 32,000km at the end of 2019, covering 80% of China\u2019s major cities and surpassing the 30,000km goal by 2020 laid out under the 13th Five Year Plan. Though the details of infrastructure goals won\u2019t be released until the next five year plan in 2021, high-speed rail is expected to be at least a $4.4 billion industry by 2023, with maintenance and replacement accounting for a rapidly growing share of expenditures. Higher growth is expected in the urban rail transit sector, which is expected to grow from 5,500km to 9,276km by 2023. In general, infrastructure needs are driven by the rapid urbanization and regional economic integration and is supported by ambitious policies such as the five year plans, Eight Horizontal and Eight Vertical High-speed Railway Corridors project, and the Belt and Road Initiatives. With its leading market share in these industries, HOLI is well positioned to take advantage of this growth. \u00ad\n\nChina\u2019s industrial automation market is similarly poised for accelerated growth. Total contract amount from industrial automation in China grew at a 4.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2014 to 2018 and reached a total value of $30.1 billion. The market is estimated to accelerate that growth to 11.1% CAGR from 2018 to 2023 and reach $50.6 billion. Over that same time, petrochemicals and power are expected to grow at CAGRs of 14.5% and 5.8%, respectively. While competition in the industrial automation market is stiffer, HOLI\u2019s roots in automation for power and petrochemicals, growing name brand recognition in China, advanced technology, and cash-rich position give it a good position to increase its market share. Importantly, HOLI has a unique advantage when it comes to nuclear power. \n\nThe 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster threw a major wrench into China\u2019s plans for nuclear power. To reassure the population that the country was not a risk of a similar catastrophe, the PRC placed a moratorium on the construction of new power plants. After lifting that ban in 2019, the country has 47 nuclear reactors in commercial operation, with twelve more under constructions and more on the way. The impetus for nuclear power in China has increased due to air pollution from coal-fired plants and as a result the country has subsidized nuclear power with an aim to match and surpass the world average of 15% for total electricity generated by nuclear power (currently at 4.75%). HOLI is the only qualified local automation and control product provider to the non-safety control for nuclear power stations. In the nuclear automation segment, HOLI competes with multi-national corporations such as Siemens, Areva, and Invensys, but with the abnormal glut in demand created by the Fukushima disaster HOLI has a prime opportunity to increase its market share.\n\nThe M&amp;E division offers solutions through Concord and Bond Groups, two subsidiaries acquired by HOLI in 2011 and 2013, respectively, in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Hong Kong. While this division has the lowest revenue and profit margins in relation to the company\u2019s other operations, it also offers its greatest opportunity for business expansion and diversification. A 2019 partnering with the London engineering consulting firm Arup signals a willingness to expand the M&amp;E offerings, potentially through more acquisitions. While profitable, the revenues generated by this division do not significantly affect our valuation of the company. Barring any interesting acquisitions, the only growth we forecast for M&amp;E is over the long-term.\n\nAn important measure in our valuation comes from HOLI\u2019s dedication to research and development. Historically, the company spends 6-7% of revenue on R&amp;D, and 40%, or 1,500 employees, of the 3,200 person company work in R&amp;D. Their proprietary technology is at the center of their rail and power offerings \u2013 as of June 30, 2019, HOLI held 221 software copyrights, 126 authorized patents, 64 pending patent applications, and 44 registered trademarks. The Chairman and CEO, Shao Baiqing, has been with the company for more than 25 years starting as one of the founding engineers, and \u201cis widely regarded as an industry leader with significant influence in China.\u201d \n\nDespite the fact that EBITDA has grown over 60% since FY17, HOLI has an EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 3.  Not only is this well below the historical multiple for the company, it is also low enough to be a solid multiple for a coal company. Taking into account the growing industrial automation and high-speed transit sectors in China, while accounting for some slowdown in infrastructure spending in the current year as the window of the 12th Five Year Plan is closing having already surpassed expected rail mileage, we use a conservative estimate of 5% revenue growth rate YoY. We see no reason for net income growth to lag behind this rate. Using consistent conservative estimates to project unlevered free cash flow, and re-levering the beta to reflect average competitor beta, we arrive at a fair value of $25 per share, close to a 60% discount rate.\n\n***Risks***\n\n* Corona virus may mutate and spread, further depressing Chinese stock values for an unknown amount of time.\n* Escalations by either the U.S. or China in their trade war could negatively affect trade relations or may cause further slowdowns in Chinese economic growth and depreciation of the RMB. This has the potential to adversely impact HOLI\u2019s supply chain for its products and stifle the demand for capital projects and domestic investment in China.\n* The Beijing and Hangzhou subsidiaries of Hollysys are recognized as high and new technology enterprises, or HNTEs, by the PRC government, which entitle each of them to a reduced income tax rate of 15% (compared to the statutory income tax rate of 25%). Additionally, HOLI received VAT refunds and government subsidies of $33 million in FY2019. If the HNTE status is not renewed for those subsidiaries, or the PRC stops recognizing HOLI as a qualified research and development enterprise deserving of VAT refunds, the result could have a material adverse effect on future operations.", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 491813, "public", "self", "Long on HOLI", 0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f390p3/long_on_holi/", "all_ads", 6, 1581592085.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MeaFiet", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ck009", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1581595685, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f390p3/long_on_holi/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f390p3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/f390p3/long_on_holi/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1581595686, "score": 1, "selftext": "**Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd.

The major averages all had their best weekly gains in months despite that Friday drop, but the trend is clearly negative as we head into the new week. The Nasdaq\u2019s weekly gain last week was its largest since November 2018, even after a 0.5% fall on Friday. Tech has been February\u2019s strongest sector so far, and the Consumer Staples sector finished last week at a record high. (CNBC)\n* The Trump administration will release its fiscal 2021 budget today, which will show the economy growing at an average rate of 3% for the next 15 years. It\u2019s also proposing to continue tax cuts for individuals through 2035 at a cost of $1.4 trillion, a figure that serves as a rough placeholder for President Donald Trump\u2019s promised \u201cTax Cuts 2.0.\u201d (CNBC)\n* Treasury yields move higher ahead of Trump\u2019s 2021 budget (CNBC)\n* No economic releases are on today\u2019s calendar.

Tesla posted 10 consecutive weekly gains and have risen 127% over that span. (CNBC)\n* China\u2019s National Health Commission said it confirmed 3,062 new coronavirus cases and 97 additional deaths, mostly in Hubei province. The government said a total of 40,171 cases have been confirmed and 908 people have died in the country.

Josh Hawley is proposing putting the Federal Trade Commission, an independent agency, within the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch. The proposal is likely to raise alarms about removing the independence of a key regulatory body, especially as Democrats have speculated about Attorney General William Barr\u2019s closeness to Trump. (CNBC)\n* Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the leader of Germany\u2019s Christian Democratic Union and the expected successor of Angela Merkel, will not run for chancellor. She will also give up the leadership of the CDU in the summer, according to an unnamed source cited by Reuters, setting in motion a party leadership contest. (CNBC)\n* L Brands (LB) is nearing a deal to sell its Victoria\u2019s Secret brand to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal that could be announced as soon this week. It\u2019s not clear what role L Brands CEO Les Wexner would have in such a deal, as he\u2019s under mounting pressure due to his ties to the late sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein.

I want models that will make money while I sleep,\u201d Simons said. \u201cA pure system without humans interfering.\u201d\n\nSimons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information\n\nStraus\u2019 was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.\n\nHe became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.\n\nOver time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.\n\nIn fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!\n\nAt the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.\n\nThe return in 2008 is a prime example of that.\n\nCommodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.\n\nThe fund wasn't bothered as to why these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.\n\n**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**\n\nNow in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the \"best math department in the world\".\n\nTherefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.\n\nWe are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.\n\nRenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.\n\nThe strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).\n\nSimons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.\n\nIn 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&amp;P 500 at an unusually low level.\n\nThis test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.\n\nIt had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.\n\nMagerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.\n\nFinally, the simulator\u2019s algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.\n\nThe resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman\u2019s calculations.\n\nOnly then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good....\n\n**PART 3: Infrastructure**\n\nNow I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.\n\nBig data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.\n\nThe problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high:\n\nBuilding a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.\n\nTo then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.\n\nRenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.\n\nThey have completely automated the process of signal discovery:\n\nThey don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.\n\nRenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.\n\nThe data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up.

I want models that will make money while I sleep,\u201d Simons said. \u201cA pure system without humans interfering.\u201d\n\nSimons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information\n\nStraus\u2019 was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.\n\nHe became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.\n\nOver time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.\n\nIn fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!\n\nAt the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.\n\nThe return in 2008 is a prime example of that.\n\nCommodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.\n\nThe fund wasn't bothered as to why these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.\n\n**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**\n\nNow in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the \"best math department in the world\".\n\nTherefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.\n\nWe are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.\n\nRenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.\n\nThe strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).\n\nSimons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.\n\nIn 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&amp;P 500 at an unusually low level.\n\nThis test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.\n\nIt had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.\n\nMagerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.\n\nFinally, the simulator\u2019s algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.\n\nThe resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman\u2019s calculations.\n\nOnly then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good....\n\n**PART 3: Infrastructure**\n\nNow I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.\n\nBig data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.\n\nThe problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high:\n\nBuilding a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.\n\nTo then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.\n\nRenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.\n\nThey have completely automated the process of signal discovery:\n\nThey don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.\n\nRenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.\n\nThe data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.\n\nThe mathematics of *efficiently processing* that data are what matters.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\n**The takeaway from this is the following: do not day trade, you will get REKT.**\n\n**You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.**", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 488569, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The GOAT Hedge Fund: Renaissance Technologies", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f1o73u/the_goat_hedge_fund_renaissance_technologies/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1581325049.0}], [[], false, "LeonardoRafaell", null, [], null, "text", "t2_4wedjg9i", false, false, [], false, false, 1581249754, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f17rwc/whats_your_favorite_cloud_stock/", {}, "f17rwc", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 12, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/f17rwc/whats_your_favorite_cloud_stock/", false, 6, 1581249754, 1, "Besides azure and aws, what are some other good cloud plays?\n\nSo far I have OTEX, TEAM, VEEV.....looking for maybe 1-2 more", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 487792, "public", "self", "Whats your favorite CLOUD stock?", 0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f17rwc/whats_your_favorite_cloud_stock/", "all_ads", 6, 1581246154.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LeonardoRafaell", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4wedjg9i", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1581249754, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f17rwc/whats_your_favorite_cloud_stock/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f17rwc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/f17rwc/whats_your_favorite_cloud_stock/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1581249754, "score": 1, "selftext": "Besides azure and aws, what are some other good cloud plays?\n\nSo far I have OTEX, TEAM, VEEV.....looking for maybe 1-2 more", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 487792, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Whats your favorite CLOUD stock?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f17rwc/whats_your_favorite_cloud_stock/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1581246154.0}], [[], false, "ModernDayHippi", null, [], null, "text", "t2_e3cv7", false, false, [], false, false, 1581011615, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ezw0sb/mgi_dd/", {}, "ezw0sb", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 2, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/ezw0sb/mgi_dd/", false, 6, 1581011623, 1, "**Partnerships, Technology, streamlining**  \n\n- First money transfer company to utilize blockchain capabilities at scale through our Ripple strategic partnership.

There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds.

Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

**Walt Disney Co (DIS)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, February 4, 2020. The consensus earnings estimate is $1.43 per share on revenue of $21.08 billion and the Earnings Whisper \u00ae number is $1.51 per share. Investor sentiment going into the company's earnings release has 81% expecting an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are for earnings to decline year-over-year by 22.28% with revenue increasing by 37.75%. Short interest has increased by 5.0% since the company's last earnings release while the stock has drifted lower by 1.4% from its open following the earnings release to be 0.2% above its 200 day moving average of $138.09.

There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

(the \" Company \" or \" Guyana Goldstrike \") (TSXV: GYA ) , ( OTC:GYNAF ) , ( FSE:1ZT ) is pleased to announce that the Company has selected drill targets at the Marudi Gold Project (\" Marudi \" or the \"Property\" , or the \" Project \") located in Guyana, South America.\n\nThe Company's 2018/19 trenching program successfully outlined a new mineralized area that continues for more than 1.75 kilometres along Toucan Ridge (see map below). Toucan Ridge is roughly one kilometre northeast of the Mazoa Hill Zone which currently contains the Project's mineral resource estimate (please see \" Mineral Resource Estimate \" below).\n\nA diamond drill program of up to 12 holes is planned and may be extended. The planned drill program will predominately focus on Toucan Ridge where a total of 2,458 metres of trenching was completed and 837 samples were taken.\n\nDrill targets have been chosen from identified magnetic anomalies and gold assays from surface trenching and sampling of the quartzite-metachert host rock.\n\nThe specific drill locations will be in proximity to trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8, as priority targets, followed potentially by drilling trench areas TTR-18-9, TTR-18-11, TTR-18-12, and TTR-18-13.\n\nIn 2018, trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8 assayed grades as high as 7.2 g/t Au over 3 metres.\n\nThe first drill pads will be positioned to drill angled holes across the area of trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8 to an initial planned depth of 130 metres and a maximum depth of 200 metres.\n\nIn preparation for the next phase of exploration, the technical team has reviewed the legacy data, including drill assays, drill angles, collar location, grade and interval lengths from past drilling on the Property in order to further refine its exploration efforts at Marudi. The compilation of these historic drill assays will provide important information that the technical team will use to calibrate drilling on the Property.\n\nThe following assay highlights are from the Mazoa Hill Zone which is approximately one kilometre south west of the Toucan Ridge discovery area:\n\nAssay Highlights of Sutton Resources Diamond Drill Programs 1991-94 - Mazoa Hill Zone:\n\n* \\- MR 91-068 - 6 metres of 29.97 g/t Au; within 72 metres of 5.11 g/t Au  \n\\- MR 91-074 - 15 metres of 15.30 g/t Au; within 75.00 metres of 4.60 g/t Au  \n\\- MR 94-102 - 52 metres of 4.06 g/t Au; within 190 metres of 2.39 g/t Au  \n\\- MR 94-113 - 36 metres of 7.74 g/t Au; within 141 metres of 3.31 g/t Au  \n\\- MR 94-115 - 45 metres of 10.82 g/t Au and 30 metres of 15.16 g/t Au; within 81 metres of 7.71 g/t Au  \n\\- MR 94-120 - 12 metres of 16.65 g/t Au; within 57 metres of 4.51 g/t Au\n\nPlease note: Interval lengths are not true widths.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMineral Resource Estimates\n\nThe Mazoa Hill Zone contains the Company's current mineral resource estimate. Data analyzed suggests that the mineralized zone is open in several directions including at depth.\n\n* \\- 243,300 indicated gold ounces within 3,637,000 tonnes grading 2.1 g/t;  \n\\- 78,800 inferred gold ounces within 1,278,000 tonnes grading 1.9 g/t\n\nFor further information concerning the Mazoa Hill Zone Resource Estimate, readers are encouraged to review \" Technical Report: Marudi Property Mazoa Hill Mineral Resource Estimate \", a technical report prepared for the Company by Global Mineral Resource Services and is available at: [GYA Mazoa Hill Zone 43-101 ](http://www.guyanagoldstrike.com/images/pdf/43101_Report_Guyana_Goldstrike_Mazoa_Hill_Zone_Jan_2018.pdf), at the Company's website [www.guyanagoldstrike.com ](http://www.guyanagoldstrike.com/)and under the Company's profile on [www.sedar.com ](http://www.sedar.com/).\n\nReaders are cautioned that although the Project has a mineral resource estimate and a mining license a production decision has not been reached by the Company in respect of the Project, nor has a feasibility study been completed to assess the economic viability of commercial production at the Project. Also note, mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n\nThe Company also announces that Frontier Flex Marketing (Frontier) continues to provide investor relations and marketing services to the Company. The agreement with Frontier commenced on January 2019, with remuneration of $7,000 per month. The services were put on hiatus for an extended period in 2019. The Company has re-commenced services as of January 2020. This was part of an extension and revision to an original agreement with Frontier Merchant Capital for similar investor relations and marketing services that was signed on January 2018, with remuneration of $5,000 per month. Frontier Merchant Capital were also granted 50,000 stock options of the Company at 25 cents in January 2018 and 150,000 stock options at 30 cents on October 30, 2018.\n\nAbout Guyana Goldstrike Inc.\n\nThe Company is developing the Marudi Gold Project, which has a 17-year mining license and is located in Guyana, South America. Historic diamond drilling completed on the Project by prior operators have delineated two zones of gold mineralization: Mazoa Hill and Marudi North zones. A mineral resource estimate has been completed on the Mazoa Hill Zone. Data analyzed suggests the zone is open to mineralization in multiple directions and at depth.\n\nThrough the recent exploration program, the Company has discovered a third mineralized zone, called Toucan Ridge, which is situated approximately 1000 metres to the northeast of the Mazoa Hill Zone. In addition to the known gold zones and the new Toucan Ridge zone, the Company has over 45 sq. kms of underexplored land and believes the greater land position has excellent upside potential for the discovery of new mineralized zones through the development of previously and newly identified mineralized bedrock targets on the Project.\n\nAbout Guyana\n\nThe Republic of Guyana is located in South America adjacent to Suriname. The country is English speaking and its legal system is based on British common law with a democratically elected government. It has an established mining act and a rich history of gold production. The Fraser Institute's 2016 Annual Survey of Mining listed Guyana as the third best mining jurisdiction with regards to investment attractiveness in the Latin America and Caribbean Basin sub-group. The Guiana Shield is the geographic gold-hosting region and is world-recognized as a premier gold region that is highly prospective, under-explored and has geological continuity with West Africa. Barrick has recently announced that the Giuana Shield will be their priority region for discovery opportunities and early stage exploration.\\* Exxon Recently announced the discovery of 6 billion barrels of offshore oil with production scheduled for first quarter of 2020.

The compilation of these historic drill assays will provide important information that the technical team will use to calibrate drilling on the Property.\n\nThe following assay highlights are from the Mazoa Hill Zone which is approximately one kilometre south west of the Toucan Ridge discovery area:\n\nAssay Highlights of Sutton Resources Diamond Drill Programs 1991-94 - Mazoa Hill Zone:\n\n* \\- MR 91-068 - 6 metres of 29.97 g/t Au; within 72 metres of 5.11 g/t Au  \n\\- MR 91-074 - 15 metres of 15.30 g/t Au; within 75.00 metres of 4.60 g/t Au  \n\\- MR 94-102 - 52 metres of 4.06 g/t Au; within 190 metres of 2.39 g/t Au  \n\\- MR 94-113 - 36 metres of 7.74 g/t Au; within 141 metres of 3.31 g/t Au  \n\\- MR 94-115 - 45 metres of 10.82 g/t Au and 30 metres of 15.16 g/t Au; within 81 metres of 7.71 g/t Au  \n\\- MR 94-120 - 12 metres of 16.65 g/t Au; within 57 metres of 4.51 g/t Au\n\nPlease note: Interval lengths are not true widths.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMineral Resource Estimates\n\nThe Mazoa Hill Zone contains the Company's current mineral resource estimate. Data analyzed suggests that the mineralized zone is open in several directions including at depth.\n\n* \\- 243,300 indicated gold ounces within 3,637,000 tonnes grading 2.1 g/t;  \n\\- 78,800 inferred gold ounces within 1,278,000 tonnes grading 1.9 g/t\n\nFor further information concerning the Mazoa Hill Zone Resource Estimate, readers are encouraged to review \" Technical Report: Marudi Property Mazoa Hill Mineral Resource Estimate \", a technical report prepared for the Company by Global Mineral Resource Services and is available at: [GYA Mazoa Hill Zone 43-101 ](http://www.guyanagoldstrike.com/images/pdf/43101_Report_Guyana_Goldstrike_Mazoa_Hill_Zone_Jan_2018.pdf), at the Company's website [www.guyanagoldstrike.com ](http://www.guyanagoldstrike.com/)and under the Company's profile on [www.sedar.com ](http://www.sedar.com/).\n\nReaders are cautioned that although the Project has a mineral resource estimate and a mining license a production decision has not been reached by the Company in respect of the Project, nor has a feasibility study been completed to assess the economic viability of commercial production at the Project. Also note, mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n\nThe Company also announces that Frontier Flex Marketing (Frontier) continues to provide investor relations and marketing services to the Company. The agreement with Frontier commenced on January 2019, with remuneration of $7,000 per month. The services were put on hiatus for an extended period in 2019. The Company has re-commenced services as of January 2020. This was part of an extension and revision to an original agreement with Frontier Merchant Capital for similar investor relations and marketing services that was signed on January 2018, with remuneration of $5,000 per month. Frontier Merchant Capital were also granted 50,000 stock options of the Company at 25 cents in January 2018 and 150,000 stock options at 30 cents on October 30, 2018.\n\nAbout Guyana Goldstrike Inc.\n\nThe Company is developing the Marudi Gold Project, which has a 17-year mining license and is located in Guyana, South America. Historic diamond drilling completed on the Project by prior operators have delineated two zones of gold mineralization: Mazoa Hill and Marudi North zones. A mineral resource estimate has been completed on the Mazoa Hill Zone. Data analyzed suggests the zone is open to mineralization in multiple directions and at depth.\n\nThrough the recent exploration program, the Company has discovered a third mineralized zone, called Toucan Ridge, which is situated approximately 1000 metres to the northeast of the Mazoa Hill Zone. In addition to the known gold zones and the new Toucan Ridge zone, the Company has over 45 sq. kms of underexplored land and believes the greater land position has excellent upside potential for the discovery of new mineralized zones through the development of previously and newly identified mineralized bedrock targets on the Project.\n\nAbout Guyana\n\nThe Republic of Guyana is located in South America adjacent to Suriname. The country is English speaking and its legal system is based on British common law with a democratically elected government. It has an established mining act and a rich history of gold production. The Fraser Institute's 2016 Annual Survey of Mining listed Guyana as the third best mining jurisdiction with regards to investment attractiveness in the Latin America and Caribbean Basin sub-group. The Guiana Shield is the geographic gold-hosting region and is world-recognized as a premier gold region that is highly prospective, under-explored and has geological continuity with West Africa. Barrick has recently announced that the Giuana Shield will be their priority region for discovery opportunities and early stage exploration.\\* Exxon Recently announced the discovery of 6 billion barrels of offshore oil with production scheduled for first quarter of 2020. This discovery will designate Guyana as having the fastest growing GPD in 2020, estimated to be 86%.\\*\\*\n\n\\*https://www.reuters.com/article/us-barrick-gold-randgold-rsrcs-explorati/barrick-keen-on-guyana-shield-canada-for-exploration-executive-idUSKCN1NL276\n\n\\*\\*https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-02/meet-the-economy-that-the-imf-sees-growing-86-in-2020\n\nQualified Person\n\nLocke Goldsmith, M.Sc., P.

(\u201cAssure\u201d) was founded in Colorado in 2015 to provide intraoperative neuromonitoring (\u201cIONM\u201d) services for spine, ear, nose, throat, cardiovascular, and other surgeries involving a patient\u2019s central nervous system. IONM has been developed and used over the past 20 years and has become a standard of care in the healthcare industry.\u00a0\n\nIONM reduces the risk of central nervous system damage after certain types of surgeries. Injuries stemming from surgeries involving a patient\u2019s central nervous system can be difficult to detect immediately following surgery, so IONM allows physicians to detect injuries before they become so severe that no viable action can be taken. Common risks of surgeries involving the central nervous system include paralysis, muscle weakness, and hearing loss.\n\n# Management Team\n\nIn 2018, Assure\u2019s founder and CEO, Preston Parsons, transitioned to a director on the company\u2019s board, focused on key growth initiatives such as surgical/geographical expansion and strategic acquisitions. Simultaneously, John Farlinger became the company\u2019s CEO. Mr. Farlinger has \\~20 years of experience as a venture capital and private equity executive. It\u2019s worth mentioning that both Mr. Parsons and Mr. Farlinger received total compensation around $350,000 in 2018 with Mr. Parsons owning \\~39% of the company (equivalent to a $16 million stake at today\u2019s stock price of $1.22). As a result, I believe the company\u2019s management team is well incentivized to maximize shareholder value over the long-term. \n\n# Financials\n\nYear-to-date 2019, the company grew revenue 112% to $22.4 million, as well as increasing net income and adjusted EBITDA to $9.3 million and $13.8 million, representing increases of 143% and 154%, respectively. In addition, Assure grew its managed case volume by 95% in Q3 2019. In the first half of 2019, the company completed a $0.7 million tuck-in acquisitions that added a couple hundred cases to Assure\u2019s market share. The company recently announced a $7.0 million acquisition for a company that is slated to close in early 2020. This acquisition has completed 2,500 cases in the last 12 months, 95% of which were derived from commercial insurance payors (compared to \\~50% for Assure). I would expect Assure to continue to pursue more acquisitions as the company continues to scale and is able to gain access to more growth capital to further consolidate the IONM industry. \n\n# Key Risks\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this company is fairly small, with a market cap of approximately $50 million. This means the company historically had a fairly concentrated portion of revenue generated from a single state/surgical procedure, in addition to various other operational/execution risks. For instance, the company suffered from some revenue cycle management and cash collection issues in 2018, which resulted in a large bad debt expense for the year. The company recently hired a VP of strategy and a revenue cycle management director in order to better control cash collections and avoid a similar bad debt expense charge the company recorded in 2018. Out-of-network revenue and cash collections remain key issues to monitor going forward.\n\n# Summary\n\nGiven the company\u2019s progress in 2019, I estimate that Assure will generate revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA of $30 million, $12 million, and $18 million, respectively. This equates to net and EBITDA margins of 40% and 60%, respectively. Practically every financial metric has grown 90%+ in 2019 (compared to pro-forma 2018 figures reflecting the company\u2019s bad debt expense), so I think it is reasonable to conclude that the company is able to grow its top and bottom-line by 30% in 2020. This would result in revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA of $39 million, $15.6 million, and $23.4 million, respectively.\n\nBased off my 2020 projections, the company has a forward price/sales ratio of 1.3x, a P/E ratio of 3x, and an EV/EBITDA ratio of 2x. With 2020 EPS of $0.39 and a P/E ratio of 15 (given a 30% growth profile), the company should be trading at a price of \\~$6.00 per share (\\~4-5x the current stock price of $1.35). Assuming 25% top and bottom line growth in 2021 and 20% top and bottom line growth in 2022, the company should generate EPS of $0.59. At a P/E ratio of 15, the company is likely to trade at $8.85 per share. Given the growth profile of Assure, I would expect the market to attribute a P/E ratio closer to its bottom line growth profile (a company growing earnings by 20% should trade a at a P/E of 20, all else being equal). Of course, the general level of interest rates and other macroeconomic factors impact the multiples certain companies trade at; however, I believe as Assure scales, the company will attract more institutional capital and will trade closer to a P/E ratio around 20x in 2022. Assuming EPS of $0.59, the company should trade at a price of $11.80 (\\~10x the company\u2019s current share price). \n\nI have a long position in ARHH.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 20th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings will decide whether the market continues to hit new highs after another week of records  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/earnings-will-decide-whether-market-continues-to-hit-new-highs.html)**\n*****\n&gt; With the Chinese trade deal out of the way, earnings could be the biggest driver for stocks in the week ahead, as big tech, financial, consumer and industrial companies report.\n*****\n&gt; So far, the early rush of earnings are beating estimates at a pace of about 70%. Just a few dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report in the four-day trading week, including IBM Tuesday and Intel on Thursday. Johnson &amp; Johnson reports Wednesday; Procter &amp; Gamble is Thursday, and American Express releases results Friday. The stock market is closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump travels to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum, where he speaks Tuesday. With the China trade deal signed this past Wednesday, strategists say they are now watching for any signs of a bigger trade row brewing between the U.S. and Europe.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports, including existing home sales Wednesday; leading indicators Thursday, and the Markit PMI data for manufacturing and services on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; But it\u2019s earnings, where investors will take the pulse of corporate America, and decide whether forward guidance is justifying the stock market\u2019s record highs and price earnings ratio of more than 18.5. The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 2% in the past week, its best week since August. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,329 Friday and is now up about 3% since the start of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow and Nasdaq also ended the week at new highs. The Dow ended up 1.9% for the week, at 29,348. The Nasdaq rose 2.3% in the past week, ending at 9,388.\n*****\n&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse, said the fourth quarter could be a turning point for earnings, after a poor performance in 2019. So far, earnings are down about 0.8% this quarter, based on actual releases and estimates, according to Refinitiv. If not for the drag from energy companies, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies would have been 1.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201c2019 was a year of lousy earnings, and the fourth quarter is the end of a lousy year,\u201d said Golub. \u201cI think earnings surprises will be fine, but what the real story here is, it looks like magically the 2020 numbers are going to be much, much stronger than 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said there are two big themes this earnings season. \u201cThe first one is tech-related companies. Many of the mega caps had okay earnings, but their margins were under a lot of pressure and it subtracted earnings growth in 2019. Those trends are supposed to reverse. So what was a negative because of easy comps becomes a positive,\u201d Golub said. \u201cThe same thing with the energy sector which was a disaster in terms of earnings growth in 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market rally can continue in part because investors are not yet on board with the earnings story.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile everybody is looking at the fourth quarter, I think they\u2019re not really reading the right script, and the script they should be reading was this was the last quarter where tech margins and energy sector headwinds are overwhelming the market,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The hearings on Trump\u2019s impeachment are so far ignored by markets and will be underway in the Senate. While the market continues to shrug it off, traders are monitoring the situation for any change in tone.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWill there be new evidence/witnesses at the Senate trial to make it politically significant?,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Alan Ruskin. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that for many voters, the President seems to be the main motivator for voters on both sides of the political spectrum \u2014 for and against. This argument runs along the lines that Trump is running against himself/\u2018the anti-Trump\u2019, and, the election will be heavily impacted by which Democrat candidate least impacts the \u2018anti-Trump\u2019 vote \u2014 a view that some argue tends to support centrists like Biden.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7YCrtpo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9jQCYRG.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXureFC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/3upRv6z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O07l30Z.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BjiCdpH.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/w5fgr9y.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/L81ewyy.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vroSSfA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MMO35Qf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/dCxJl8u.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading Mixed since 1998, But Improving Lately\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 22 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.79% by DJIA to 0.14% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last eight years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef3ff1e52532ea69e189a7cd90e7b27/bf3ce263396269e9-14/s500x750/4fc5ea153df07c1e2ab94f583409f214f2eae3c6.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Closer Look At Election Years\n\n&gt; 2020 is off to a roaring start, picking up right where 2019 left off. Many investors are eyeing the upcoming presidential election as an impending storm for the stock market. In the four-year presidential cycle, pre-election years have tended to be the strongest for stocks, as sitting presidents have taken measures to boost the economy and stock market higher to garner votes. It sure worked out well last year, with the S&amp;P 500 Index\u2019s 31% total return.\n\n&gt; Returns in election years, however, have been quite bifurcated.\n\n&gt; \u201cIf an incumbent president was up for reelection, stocks tended to do extremely well,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOn the other hand, if there was a lame duck president in office, returns were quite muted.\u201d\n\n&gt; Note that a \u201clame duck president\u201d means the sitting president either isn\u2019t running for reelection or has already fulfilled the maximum two terms. It makes sense, as the president could be less motivated to do things to heat up the economy if they know they are leaving office. Possibly, investors may also get cold feet knowing a change is coming. The S&amp;P 500 was down in 2000 and 2008, and the sitting president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d both years.\n\n&gt; In the LPL Chart of the Day, we break down election years by whether the president was running for reelection or a lame duck. The chart shows the S&amp;P 500 up an impressive 11.7% on average if the President was running for reelection, compared to up an average of 2.4% if president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d.\n\n&gt; Given most presidents who have run a second time have tended to win, this could be the market\u2019s way of saying it is comfortable with the status quo over change.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another encouraging historical trend is that the S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t been lower during an election year with an incumbent president up for reelection since 1940. To be clear, stocks have been up during election years when the incumbent president actually lost. In 1980, the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 26%, but Jimmy Carter still lost to Ronald Reagan. In other words, this does support the notion of higher stocks in 2020, but higher stocks can\u2019t always tell you who will win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Q4 Earnings Season is All About 2020\n\n&gt; Fourth quarter earnings season kicked off this week with 24 S&amp;P 500 Index companies slated to report results. Our expectations are for a marginal increase in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis, based on current FactSet consensus estimates (-2% year over year) and the average historical upside of roughly 3 percentage points.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve become accustomed to meager earnings growth. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if fourth quarter results are anywhere near expectations, 2019 will end up as a year with S&amp;P 500 returns of more than 30% and no corporate earnings growth to speak of. That means expanding stock valuations drove the market\u2019s gains last year, a trend we do not expect to continue.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Earnings-blog-011520-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWe expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWith valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Accordingly, the key to this reporting season will be whether the optimistic growth outlook reflected in consensus earnings estimates for this year remains intact after companies issue guidance. Many companies will be commenting on 2020 for the first time. Our estimate of $175 per share in S&amp;P 500 EPS for the entire year represents a 6\u20137% increase from our $165 forecast for 2019. Based on the latest consensus estimates, that growth rate may get pushed up a bit. We still think $175 is attainable if capital investment picks up after stalling last year and wage growth remains stable.\n\n&gt; Trade progress may help. The United States and China will sign the phase-one trade deal later today. While negotiations on the next phase will be tougher and could even stall out, businesses would welcome the additional clarity that de-escalation can provide, something that clearly weighed on corporate profits last year.\n\n*****\n\n# January Off To Stronger Than Usual Start \u2013 But 2nd Half Is Weaker\n\n&gt; Stocks are off to a stronger that usual so far in January 2020 when compared in the chart above to the average performance over the most recent 21-year period. As of today\u2019s close DJIA is up 1.41%, S&amp;P 500 +1.61%, NASDAQ leads the pack +3.11% and the Russell 2000 was in the red until the past two days and is now up 0.44%. This is well above historical average performance in recent Januarys.\n\n&gt; The market was up nicely today until reports hit the newswires at about 1:30 pm ET creating uncertainty that the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed tomorrow between the US and China may be pabulum. The realization that the tariffs on Chinese goods may remain in place until after the election as the review process runs its course drove stocks lower this afternoon. The market gave back most of its early gains with only the Dow and Russell 2000 eking out gains today.\n\n&gt; However, as you can see in the dotted lines so far in 2020 the indices are tracking the last 21-years rather closely. If the pattern continues to pan out this year, look for a little strength over the next two days. Then weakness has been prone to appear just after mid-month after the eleventh trading day with mild average losses from on or around the eleventh trading day to the fourteenth trading day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2f102c5c61bd803b4bc407e8c4812e3/1b34c8a8e7ad3e39-e9/s500x750/829ff7ea82b52109b737d17e4b24cb0a4d28e434.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Jackpot for Stocks\n\n&gt; Solid across the board gains this year have put another January Trifecta Jackpot in our sights for 2020. So far our January Trifecta is two for two. Our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system came in positive up 0.7% on January 8 following up on a positive reading for our Santa Claus Rally (SCR) on January 3. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month\u2019s end.\n\n&gt; We just published an update on The Incredible January Barometer: Only 11 Major Errors in 82 Years that runs through the reasons behind the efficacy of the January. We discuss how the passage of the Twentieth \u201cLame Duck\u201d Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 created the January Barometer. We also compare the January Barometer results along with the full year results, the following eleven months results, and the subsequent twelve months results to all other \u201cMonthly Barometers\u201d using the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite\n\n&gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table below). In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing \u201cLast 11 Mon\u201d years, in the table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 \u201319.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.\n\n&gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain decent. Of the last 10 times since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.\n\n&gt; A positive SCR and FFD are encouraging and further clarity will be gained when the January Barometer (page 16, 2020 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac) reports at month\u2019s end. A positive January Barometer would certainly boost prospects for full-year 2020. The December Low Indicator (2020 STA, page 34) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow\u2019s December Closing Low of 27502.81 on 12/3/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1bcaf64028a60761e27f90b96cd50a5/be57098a98452149-c8/s500x750/8bde32d516bf2811adabb784ab6de926796ad504.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equities Closing In On A Breakout\n\n&gt; Below is a chart of the Bloomberg World Equity Market index, which is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 publicly listed companies around the world (including the US). While the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 15% from its January 2018 high, it's notable that we still haven't seen equities break out on a global scale. As shown, the Bloomberg World Index is now just a hair below its prior all-time highs (22 basis points to be exact).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-BBG-World.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-SP-5-years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Three Months And Counting Since Last 1% Decline\n\n&gt; It has now been over three months since the S&amp;P 500's last decline of 1% or more back on 10/9. While it seems like an eternity, the current streak of 67 trading days is nowhere near any sort of record on either a long or short-term basis. The chart below shows historical streaks without a decline of 1%+ for the S&amp;P 500 dating back to 1928. The record for the longest streak was back in 1963 when the S&amp;P 500 went 174 trading days - a full eight months - without a 1% drop. Even more impressive is the fact that in both the 1950s and 1960s there were numerous streaks of 100 or more days. For a decade that is looked back on as one with a lot of upheaval in the US, the 1960s was a period of relative calm for the equity market.\n\n&gt; More recently, the current streak of 67 trading days doesn't look all that impressive relative to streaks we saw back in 2017 and 2018. Right after the election in 2016 and into March of 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had a 109-day streak without a 1% decline, and then from late 2017 through January 2018, there was another streak of 112 trading days without a 1% drop. Even in October 2018, there was another streak of 74 trading days. In other words, in just the last three years there have been three longer streaks without a 1% decline than the current one.

The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,329 Friday and is now up about 3% since the start of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow and Nasdaq also ended the week at new highs. The Dow ended up 1.9% for the week, at 29,348. The Nasdaq rose 2.3% in the past week, ending at 9,388.\n*****\n&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse, said the fourth quarter could be a turning point for earnings, after a poor performance in 2019. So far, earnings are down about 0.8% this quarter, based on actual releases and estimates, according to Refinitiv. If not for the drag from energy companies, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies would have been 1.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201c2019 was a year of lousy earnings, and the fourth quarter is the end of a lousy year,\u201d said Golub. \u201cI think earnings surprises will be fine, but what the real story here is, it looks like magically the 2020 numbers are going to be much, much stronger than 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said there are two big themes this earnings season. \u201cThe first one is tech-related companies. Many of the mega caps had okay earnings, but their margins were under a lot of pressure and it subtracted earnings growth in 2019. Those trends are supposed to reverse. So what was a negative because of easy comps becomes a positive,\u201d Golub said. \u201cThe same thing with the energy sector which was a disaster in terms of earnings growth in 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market rally can continue in part because investors are not yet on board with the earnings story.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile everybody is looking at the fourth quarter, I think they\u2019re not really reading the right script, and the script they should be reading was this was the last quarter where tech margins and energy sector headwinds are overwhelming the market,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The hearings on Trump\u2019s impeachment are so far ignored by markets and will be underway in the Senate. While the market continues to shrug it off, traders are monitoring the situation for any change in tone.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWill there be new evidence/witnesses at the Senate trial to make it politically significant?,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Alan Ruskin. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that for many voters, the President seems to be the main motivator for voters on both sides of the political spectrum \u2014 for and against. This argument runs along the lines that Trump is running against himself/\u2018the anti-Trump\u2019, and, the election will be heavily impacted by which Democrat candidate least impacts the \u2018anti-Trump\u2019 vote \u2014 a view that some argue tends to support centrists like Biden.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7YCrtpo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9jQCYRG.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXureFC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/3upRv6z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O07l30Z.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BjiCdpH.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/w5fgr9y.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/L81ewyy.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vroSSfA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MMO35Qf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/dCxJl8u.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading Mixed since 1998, But Improving Lately\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 22 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.79% by DJIA to 0.14% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last eight years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef3ff1e52532ea69e189a7cd90e7b27/bf3ce263396269e9-14/s500x750/4fc5ea153df07c1e2ab94f583409f214f2eae3c6.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Closer Look At Election Years\n\n&gt; 2020 is off to a roaring start, picking up right where 2019 left off. Many investors are eyeing the upcoming presidential election as an impending storm for the stock market. In the four-year presidential cycle, pre-election years have tended to be the strongest for stocks, as sitting presidents have taken measures to boost the economy and stock market higher to garner votes. It sure worked out well last year, with the S&amp;P 500 Index\u2019s 31% total return.\n\n&gt; Returns in election years, however, have been quite bifurcated.\n\n&gt; \u201cIf an incumbent president was up for reelection, stocks tended to do extremely well,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOn the other hand, if there was a lame duck president in office, returns were quite muted.\u201d\n\n&gt; Note that a \u201clame duck president\u201d means the sitting president either isn\u2019t running for reelection or has already fulfilled the maximum two terms. It makes sense, as the president could be less motivated to do things to heat up the economy if they know they are leaving office. Possibly, investors may also get cold feet knowing a change is coming. The S&amp;P 500 was down in 2000 and 2008, and the sitting president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d both years.\n\n&gt; In the LPL Chart of the Day, we break down election years by whether the president was running for reelection or a lame duck. The chart shows the S&amp;P 500 up an impressive 11.7% on average if the President was running for reelection, compared to up an average of 2.4% if president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d.\n\n&gt; Given most presidents who have run a second time have tended to win, this could be the market\u2019s way of saying it is comfortable with the status quo over change.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another encouraging historical trend is that the S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t been lower during an election year with an incumbent president up for reelection since 1940. To be clear, stocks have been up during election years when the incumbent president actually lost. In 1980, the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 26%, but Jimmy Carter still lost to Ronald Reagan. In other words, this does support the notion of higher stocks in 2020, but higher stocks can\u2019t always tell you who will win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Q4 Earnings Season is All About 2020\n\n&gt; Fourth quarter earnings season kicked off this week with 24 S&amp;P 500 Index companies slated to report results. Our expectations are for a marginal increase in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis, based on current FactSet consensus estimates (-2% year over year) and the average historical upside of roughly 3 percentage points.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve become accustomed to meager earnings growth. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if fourth quarter results are anywhere near expectations, 2019 will end up as a year with S&amp;P 500 returns of more than 30% and no corporate earnings growth to speak of. That means expanding stock valuations drove the market\u2019s gains last year, a trend we do not expect to continue.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Earnings-blog-011520-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWe expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWith valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Accordingly, the key to this reporting season will be whether the optimistic growth outlook reflected in consensus earnings estimates for this year remains intact after companies issue guidance. Many companies will be commenting on 2020 for the first time. Our estimate of $175 per share in S&amp;P 500 EPS for the entire year represents a 6\u20137% increase from our $165 forecast for 2019. Based on the latest consensus estimates, that growth rate may get pushed up a bit. We still think $175 is attainable if capital investment picks up after stalling last year and wage growth remains stable.\n\n&gt; Trade progress may help. The United States and China will sign the phase-one trade deal later today. While negotiations on the next phase will be tougher and could even stall out, businesses would welcome the additional clarity that de-escalation can provide, something that clearly weighed on corporate profits last year.\n\n*****\n\n# January Off To Stronger Than Usual Start \u2013 But 2nd Half Is Weaker\n\n&gt; Stocks are off to a stronger that usual so far in January 2020 when compared in the chart above to the average performance over the most recent 21-year period. As of today\u2019s close DJIA is up 1.41%, S&amp;P 500 +1.61%, NASDAQ leads the pack +3.11% and the Russell 2000 was in the red until the past two days and is now up 0.44%. This is well above historical average performance in recent Januarys.\n\n&gt; The market was up nicely today until reports hit the newswires at about 1:30 pm ET creating uncertainty that the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed tomorrow between the US and China may be pabulum. The realization that the tariffs on Chinese goods may remain in place until after the election as the review process runs its course drove stocks lower this afternoon. The market gave back most of its early gains with only the Dow and Russell 2000 eking out gains today.\n\n&gt; However, as you can see in the dotted lines so far in 2020 the indices are tracking the last 21-years rather closely. If the pattern continues to pan out this year, look for a little strength over the next two days. Then weakness has been prone to appear just after mid-month after the eleventh trading day with mild average losses from on or around the eleventh trading day to the fourteenth trading day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2f102c5c61bd803b4bc407e8c4812e3/1b34c8a8e7ad3e39-e9/s500x750/829ff7ea82b52109b737d17e4b24cb0a4d28e434.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Jackpot for Stocks\n\n&gt; Solid across the board gains this year have put another January Trifecta Jackpot in our sights for 2020. So far our January Trifecta is two for two. Our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system came in positive up 0.7% on January 8 following up on a positive reading for our Santa Claus Rally (SCR) on January 3. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month\u2019s end.\n\n&gt; We just published an update on The Incredible January Barometer: Only 11 Major Errors in 82 Years that runs through the reasons behind the efficacy of the January. We discuss how the passage of the Twentieth \u201cLame Duck\u201d Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 created the January Barometer. We also compare the January Barometer results along with the full year results, the following eleven months results, and the subsequent twelve months results to all other \u201cMonthly Barometers\u201d using the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite\n\n&gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table below). In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing \u201cLast 11 Mon\u201d years, in the table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 \u201319.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.\n\n&gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain decent. Of the last 10 times since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.\n\n&gt; A positive SCR and FFD are encouraging and further clarity will be gained when the January Barometer (page 16, 2020 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac) reports at month\u2019s end. A positive January Barometer would certainly boost prospects for full-year 2020. The December Low Indicator (2020 STA, page 34) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow\u2019s December Closing Low of 27502.81 on 12/3/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1bcaf64028a60761e27f90b96cd50a5/be57098a98452149-c8/s500x750/8bde32d516bf2811adabb784ab6de926796ad504.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equities Closing In On A Breakout\n\n&gt; Below is a chart of the Bloomberg World Equity Market index, which is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 publicly listed companies around the world (including the US). While the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 15% from its January 2018 high, it's notable that we still haven't seen equities break out on a global scale. As shown, the Bloomberg World Index is now just a hair below its prior all-time highs (22 basis points to be exact).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-BBG-World.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-SP-5-years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Three Months And Counting Since Last 1% Decline\n\n&gt; It has now been over three months since the S&amp;P 500's last decline of 1% or more back on 10/9. While it seems like an eternity, the current streak of 67 trading days is nowhere near any sort of record on either a long or short-term basis. The chart below shows historical streaks without a decline of 1%+ for the S&amp;P 500 dating back to 1928. The record for the longest streak was back in 1963 when the S&amp;P 500 went 174 trading days - a full eight months - without a 1% drop. Even more impressive is the fact that in both the 1950s and 1960s there were numerous streaks of 100 or more days. For a decade that is looked back on as one with a lot of upheaval in the US, the 1960s was a period of relative calm for the equity market.\n\n&gt; More recently, the current streak of 67 trading days doesn't look all that impressive relative to streaks we saw back in 2017 and 2018. Right after the election in 2016 and into March of 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had a 109-day streak without a 1% decline, and then from late 2017 through January 2018, there was another streak of 112 trading days without a 1% drop. Even in October 2018, there was another streak of 74 trading days. In other words, in just the last three years there have been three longer streaks without a 1% decline than the current one. In the S&amp;P 500's history, there have been 26 other streaks that have been as long or longer than the current one, and half of those went on to last at least 100 trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011420-Streaks-Without-a-1-Percent-Decline.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 17th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$TAL** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$TEAM** \n&gt; * **$KMI** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SWKS** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$MBWM** \n&gt; * **$TXN** \n&gt; * **$COF** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$UNP** \n&gt; * **$AMTD** \n&gt; * **$FNB** \n&gt; * **$SBNY** \n&gt; * **$RCI** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$STM** \n&gt; * **$AUB** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$BKR** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$NAVI** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$APH** \n&gt; * **$NTRS** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$TER** \n&gt; * **$ZION**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/cCUTW9b.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/HZqsu6j.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

Profits above $10 million are forecasted a couple of months from now. They just posted over $1 million profit for the past fiscal quarter. It is expected to keep increasing after that as they open the buildings that they're constructing worldwide. Unique company, unique tech, the only company in the world capable of such production for a particular product of much higher quality than all of their competitors.

Lots of potential products and research that has been made by their own team of scientists and they basically sell those product ideas and formulas to client companies. The client companies start producing them as if they are their own idea, basically.\n\nI invested a small amount of money initially. I have \"share recycled\" my way from hundreds of shares bought initially with my own money to over 10,000 shares, most of which I didn't contribute a dime to. I saw a rollercoaster effect in the market on a weekly basis and memorized it for that company. It was like clockwork and I became darned good at predicting it. I'm still doing it to this day and hoping to get to 50K or more shares. I do about 2 trades per week in a Roth IRA via Fidelity. When I see the price spike up about 6-8 cents to what I feel is the \"max\" it will reach given the current waiting status, I sell. I wait for it to drop down to the regular weekly low about 6-8 cents lower than that and I buy back at a much lower price. As the price rises again, I gain money. I can usually gain a good bit by selling. \n\nFor instance, 10,000 shares x .06 cent increase in the stock for the week. I see it and sell. That's $600 of increase that I've old, basically. I do active trading, so I do about one sell and one buy every week or so. It takes 2-3 days sometimes for the cash to post and be available again. Perfectly okay with this method. I buy back when it drops down to x amount, about $0.06 lower. Because of the number shares, that buys about another 2,100 shares. The number of shares that I gain with each trade and the balance itself will of course increase with each trade. Eventually it will be like 5,000 or 10,000 shares gained with each recycle.\n\nOf course, I can't do this forever. But there's an internet forum for that company's stock. Everyone else seems to have bought in at a higher price and just dug in their feet at that price, leaving it. Then they're buying it more on top of that at a similar or higher price. When I posted my share numbers and the low price that I bought it for, they all seem shocked and did the, \"Man, you're going to make some big bucks!\" thing.  I want to take it to 50,000 shares or 100,000 if I can get it up there quickly enough, then stop and wait. When it goes up to the much higher dollar amounts (people are predicting $10 to $20 a share and it may very well hit that and go above it in a year or two), I want to pull out and move half of that money over into a target retirement fund or other safe place to grow a little and yet remain more stable than all stocks. The other half I want to put into a total stock market index fund for growth and move a little at a time over to the more stable fund as it grows with time so that too much isn't in to stocks.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this share recycling method? Apparently no taxes get paid on gains in Roth IRAs. I like that. I don't want to do day trading too quickly, anyway. So am I overlooking anything?\n\nOf course, I can reason that something could go wrong. The company could tank and I could lose most or all of it. I'll take that risk. Also, I could sell all shares during one of the half recycles and the share price could shoot up one day and cause me to have to buy back in at a much higher price and therefore have a lot less shares. I'm willing to take that risk to keep bumping up share numbers. It seems to greatly outweigh that if it grows as fast as other investors in it seem to think it will.\n\nSo...my question is more so, \"Why aren't they doing this?\"  Is there anything else in the background that I need to know about share recycling?
