The valuation looks steep, as Barron\u2019s has noted. But the stock has defied skeptics, and Mizuho sees the shares gaining more than 50% over the next year. Analyst Dan Dolev raised his price target to $300 this week, largely on the strength of Square\u2019s highly profitable and fast-growing Cash App.\n\n\u201cLike good wine\u2014and in theory, marriage too\u2014Cash App\u2019s cohorts are improving over time,\u201d Dolev writes, referring to Cash App\u2019s active user base.\n\nDolev argues that Square is finding attractive new ways to monetize Cash App, which competes with PayPal\u2019s (PYPL) Venmo and other peer-to-peer payment services. Square makes money off the app by charging fees for instant deposit, which accounted for 54% of the app\u2019s gross profits in the third quarter, Dolev estimates. But that is down from 80% in 2018, reflecting faster growth in other areas, including a debit card, business payments, and trading of coin.\n\nDolev increased his gross profit estimates from the app from $2.8 billion in 2020 to $7.7 billion by 2023 as its user base jumps from 32 million to 66 million active users. Cash App is also gaining on Venmo in the 15 most populous states, based on Google searches, he adds. Cash App accounted for 60% of searches in key markets since April, up from 39% in 2018.\n\nOne caveat to all this is coin. Square acts as a broker for coin, buying the digital currency and selling it to customers, who store and trade it on Cash App. Square benefits when coin prices rise and volume increases. Coin prices have more than doubled this year, including a surge of more than 80% since September. But if demand and pricing plummet, so too will Square\u2019s gross profits.\n\nOne other headwind for Square\u2019s stock is valuation: Shares trade at 174 times estimated 2021 earnings. PayPal trades at 42 times earnings. Adyen  \ufffc(ADYEY), a Dutch digital payments stock that is growing rapidly, trades at 121 times earnings, making Square perhaps the most richly valued.\n\nNonetheless, Dolev argues that the shares are undervalued, saying they\u2019re worth $300 or 15 times 2023 sales. That would be more than double Square\u2019s already steep price to sales of 7 times, which may be a stretch even for fans of high-growth stocks.\n\nOne payments stock that\u2019s more of a value play is Fiserv (FISV). The company runs a \u201cmerchant acquiring\u201d business for retailers, setting up and managing their payment systems, and it handles e-commerce and payment processing for banks. The stock is down 2% this year due to pressure on merchant acquiring as retail sales volume shifted further into online channels during the pandemic.\n\nBut that\u2019s the opportunity, argues MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis. She upgraded Fiserv stock to a Buy with a $145 price target this week and raised her earnings estimates for 2021.\n\nWhy get bullish now? Fiserv\u2019s earnings are holding up surprisingly well, she writes, expecting the company to post $4.44 a share this year and $5.44 in 2021, a gain of 23% The stock\u2019s valuation looks appealing at 21 times estimated 2021 earnings, a slight discount to the S&amp;P 500. And merchant acquiring is in a healthier competitive position, she argues, noting that Fiserv should maintain its market share and grow revenues 14% in 2021. Fiserv is making headway with small and midsize businesses with its Clover payments platform, and the company has a \u201cstrong international presence in high growth countries\u201d such as Brazil and India.\n\nEllis expects the stock to earn a higher multiple as earnings and revenue growth reaccelerate, fueled partly by ongoing cost-savings from its big 2019 merger with First Data. Fiserv also has new CEO, Frank Bisignano, who is likely to push the company into new e-commerce areas. And more mergers are likely, Ellis argues, partly because Fiserv looks relatively under-leveraged. Acquisition targets include Worldline \ufffc (WLN.FR) or Nexi  \ufffc(Nexi.IT) in Europe, she notes, along with PagSeguro Digital \ufffc (PAGS) or StoneCo \ufffc (STNE), both based in Brazil.\n\nSource: Barron's", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 918202, "public", "self", "Wall Street Is Getting More Bullish on Square and Fiserv Stock.

The company operates through two divisions, Exploration and Production (E&amp;P), and Midstream. The E&amp;P division produces pipeline quality natural gas primarily to gas wholesalers.

It also owns rights to extract coalbed methane (CBM) in Virginia from approximately 308,000 net CBM acres, as well as 2,122,000 net CBM acres in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and New Mexico. The Midstream division owns, operates, and develops natural gas gathering and other midstream energy assets in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

At 12:22 32,015 18 DEC 20 100C were bought for $11. It\u2019s odd to see the stock decline despite being 13x it\u2019s ADV and have such a high C/P ratio for the day. Most of the calls were bought at the ask. The one major transaction is skewing this percentage a bit \u2013 I\u2019d imagine retail traders followed this and mostly traded at the mid. I will likely invest in this stock tomorrow.**\n\n2.  ***Ticker: CNX \u2013 Short Play***\n\n**Spot Price** **:8.96 -.24, (-2.61%)**\n\n**Sector: Energy**  **Industry : OIL &amp; Gas E&amp;P**\n\n**Company Summary** (from Yahoo Finance)**:** CNX Resources Corporation, an independent oil and gas company, explores for, develops, and produces natural gas properties primarily in the Appalachian Basin. The company operates through two divisions, Exploration and Production (E&amp;P), and Midstream. The E&amp;P division produces pipeline quality natural gas primarily to gas wholesalers.

It also owns rights to extract coalbed methane (CBM) in Virginia from approximately 308,000 net CBM acres, as well as 2,122,000 net CBM acres in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and New Mexico. The Midstream division owns, operates, and develops natural gas gathering and other midstream energy assets in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
