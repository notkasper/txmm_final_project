When my grandpa passed away in March, I inherited $30,000. I had $10,000 saved up as well from working the prior summer and that $10,000 was already invested in the stock market. In high school I found out about stocks in my economics class and the day I turned 18 I invested every penny I had. \n\nOnce again, I am privileged to be able to invest this money at all.. I have a college fund to pay my tuition, I don\u2019t have to worry about when my next meal is coming, and I have the freedom to spend my money as I choose. \n\nAnyways, in March &amp; April when the market crashed I decided it was time to really dive into the stock market. I spent about 5 hours every day researching companies and I\u2019m here to share what I\u2019ve learned. \n\nIn my opinion, **the** **companies** **you** **invest** **in** **should** **be** **an** **extension** **of** **your** **worldview.** Where do you think the world will be in 10 years+ and what industries will prosper from the change. As I was raised in a liberal family and hold these values, I\u2019m quite concerned with **Climate** **Change**. I\u2019ve taken college classes in this realm since and learned more about the risks we face. I believe that any company whose mission revolves around mitigating the climate crisis will prosper in the coming decades. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ll list the companies I hold and a very brief synopsis of what they do and why I hold their stock. **Please** **do** **your** **own** **research**; this is only meant to introduce young investors to a certain mindset that I hold and the companies that I choose to support. \n\n--------------------------\n\n**Tesla** **(TSLA)** \n\nportfolio weight: **22.86%**\n\ngain/loss **1026%** **gain**\n\nYou guys all know what Tesla is about. They are the premier EV company with goals of cutting battery costs by 56% and producing 20,000,000+ cars in the decade. They also have a growing energy business with solar roofs, panels, battery storage and an autobidder software. Tesla is priced insanely high by traditional metrics. If these metrics are your investing style then it\u2019s not for you. If you\u2019re like me, and you look for companies to hold for decades then I believe Tesla is one of the best investments out there. What other company will benefit from the transition to renewables in response to climate change and changing political conditions?\n\n----------------------------------\n\n**MP** **Materials** **(MP)**\n\nportfolio weight: **12.68%**\n\ngain/loss: **197%**  **gain**\n\nMP is the only active rare earth mineral miner in the U.S. They produce neodymium concentrates which are important components in NDPR magnets; used in EV motors, wind turbines, electronics &amp; much more. \n\nI bought MP during their early pre-merger days and have already seen considerable profits in a few months. I\u2019ve been shaving this position to keep it around 10% because it is a commodity play which can be quite risky. That being said, rare earths are expected to appreciate substantially in price as EV demand increases. Furthermore, MP is moving downstream to refine their rare earths themselves, as they currently ship them to China to be refined, and in the future they plan on manufacturing their own NDPR batteries. This will increase their margins greatly. \n\n----------------------------------\n\n**Planet** **13** **(PLNHF)**\n\nportfolio weight **5.35%**\n\ngain/loss: **147.71** **gain**\n\nThis one is a MJ stock and I\u2019m focusing mostly on my Climate Change investments on this post so I\u2019ll keep it brief. They own a superstore in Vegas and have their own brands. I believe the MJ industry is going to explode soon and PLNHF will benefit. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**Jinko** **Solar** **(JKS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **4.91%**\n\ngain/loss: **268.88%** **gain**\n\nJinko Solar is a leading solar panel manufacturer in China. They\u2019ve seen market consolidation in China and are poised to benefit from increasing demand and incentives around solar energy. Specifically, South East Asia is expected to see dramatic growth in renewables as China/India are responsible for a large portion of global emissions and are also seeing considerable growth in GDP and population. It\u2019s a play on the South East Asian economy and renewable industry. \n\n-------------------------------------\n\n**SolarEdge** **(SEDG)**:\n\nportfolio weight: **4.89%**\n\ngain/loss: **108.5%** **gain**\n\nSolarEdge is the global leader in panel inverters, which turn the sun\u2019s D.C. current into usable electricity for households (A.C. current). The inverter space is a much more consolidated industry with higher margins than panels. They trade at a more expensive multiple and are expected to see dramatic top and bottom line growth in the coming years. Solar panels need inverters to perform; simple as that. With fewer companies focused on this space, I expect the top players to have a large market share and grow along with the solar energy market. SEDG is also expanding into the energy storage and EV charging markets with recent acquisitions. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**Enphase** **Energy** **(ENPH)**\n\nportfolio weight: **4.43%** \n\ngain/loss: **203.08%** **gain**\n\nEnphase is also in the inverter market, with their differentiated microinverters. Micro Inverters are generally used in smaller systems and optimal for residential solar. Everything said above about the inverter market is true for Enphase as well. Enphase\u2019s business goes beyond inverters though. They are targeting a full residential energy ecosystem, with storage and their \u201cEnlighten\u201d software App, which will manage home energy usage and sell excess energy back to the grid. Enphase is very much a play on a future decentralized microgrid, with homes trading energy to each other as prices fluctuate. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**Canadian** **Solar** **(CSIQ)**\n\nportfolio weight: **4.42%**\n\ngain/loss: **118.32%** *gain**\n\nCanadian Solar is another panel manufacturing company. They are also seeing growth in market share as smaller players struggle during the pandemic. CSIQ is a low cost producer with residential, commercial and grid level projects. They are planning on expanding their recurring revenue stream through full and partial ownership of solar projects. You can read more about this on the IR page. CSIQ is a pure solar play with an international footprint and vast management expertise. They will certainly benefit from any movement towards renewables, especially if legislation is passed to set a price on carbon. \n\n--------------------------\n\n**Lemonade** **LMND** \n\nportfolio weight: **3.93%**\n\ngain/loss: **112.52** **gain**\n\nLemonade is not a climate change related investment. It\u2019s highly speculative but I think their management team and business model is really cool so I put some money in (and quickly more than doubled it). I\u2019ll be brief here, but basically they are a home/renter/pet insurance company that takes a flat 25% cut of premiums as revenue and uses the remaining money to pay out claims. They aim to align incentives by donating anything left over beyond the 25% to a charity of customers choosing. Also, their use of AI makes the registration and claims process seamless and \u201cdelights\u201d customers. \n\n----------------------------\n\n**TPI** **Composites** **(TPIC)**\n\nportfolio weight: **3.73%**\n\ngain/loss: **153.99%** **gain**\n\nTPIC manufacturers wind blade composites. They supply the top five wind turbine companies outside of China. I wrote about them on prior posts so I\u2019ll just copy &amp; paste here:\n63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with Workhorse to manufacture vehicle parts for them.\n-----------------------------\n\n**Skyworks** **Solutions** **(SWKS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.83%**\n\ngain/loss: **60.57%** **gain**\n\nSkyworks is a semiconductor focused on connectivity chips for all kinds of devices. They aren\u2019t climate change related which is the point of this post so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Tattooed** **Chef** **(TTCF)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.65%**\n\ngain/loss: **55.90** **gain**\n\nTattooed Chef is a play on the rising plant-based food trend. They make a variety of frozen food items, widely available in Walmart, Costco and Target. They are expanding into Whole Foods, Trader Joe\u2019s and many more stores, where I expect them to be very successful. The plant based market is exploding for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there is more research on the health benefits of a plant based diet, with athletes such as Chris Paul &amp; Todd Gurley endorsing these brands. Also, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the threat of climate change and how avoiding red meat can have a positive impact on the planet. I expect TTCF to benefit off of these trends and continue innovating in the plant-based space. I bought in 3 weeks ago and the price has exploded since then. \n\n-------------------------\n\n**Workhorse** **(WKHS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.60%**\n\ngain/loss: **35.90%** **gain**\n\nWorkhorse is an electric delivery van company. They manufacture last mile electric vehicles and are developing drones to further decrease last mile delivery costs. They are a play on the e-commerce industry and electrification of vehicles. I\u2019m invested in them because last mile delivery is responsible for a large chunk of transportation carbon emissions and in desperate need of electrification. I also believe that Workhorse will get a large chunk of the upcoming USPS contract which will provide a stable revenue stream.\n---------------------\n\n**Aphria** **(APHA)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.45%**\n\ngain/loss: **53%** **gain**\n\nAphria is another MJ play for me. Once again they aren\u2019t a climate change investment so I\u2019ll keep it brief. They just finalized a merger with Tilray, making them the biggest cannabis producer in the world. They are based in Canada and I believe they will be the market leader in Europe, due to their infrastructure advantage through owning CC Pharma.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Vestas** **Wind** **Systems** **(VWDRY)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.40%**\n\ngain/loss: **197.44%** **gain**\n\nVestas is the global leader in wind turbine manufacturing and installation. They are one of the few pure wind plays in the stock market, making them an attractive choice for anybody looking to get exposure to wind. A big driver if future growth will be their service and maintainace business, which their management team has been focused on in recent quarters. This is a higher margin business with consistent recurring revenues. \n\n----------------------------\n\n**Facebook** **(FB)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.38%**\n\ngain/loss: **20.61%** **gain\n\nI\u2019m selling out of FB very soon but I still hold them for now. FB is an incredible business and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll see growth in the future, but it just isn\u2019t for me (anymore). I consider ethics a lot in my investments, which many of you may consider stupid but idc. \n\n---------------------------\n\n**Hannon** **Armstrong** **(HASI)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.18%**\n\ngain/loss: **57.40%** **gain**\n\nHASI is a REIT, which solely makes climate change related investments. They invest in the land under solar projects, energy efficient buildings and much more. HASI is a great dividend play and I expect their stock price to appreciate as climate change worries are exacerbated in the future. \n\n---------------------------\n\n**Beyond** **Meat** **(BYND)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.10%**\n\ngain/loss: **21.24%** **gain**\n\nI made a post with some DD earlier this year on Beyond so I\u2019ll just link that below:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/if9tmj/beyond_meat_bynd_fundamental_analysis_with_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n---------------------------\n\n**Brookefield** **Renewable** **Partners** **(BEPC)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.06%**\n\ngain/loss: **87.23%** **gain**\n\nBEPC owns and operates a portfolio of renewable energy assets. Earlier this year they completed a merger with Terraform Power, expanding their solar &amp; wind footprint. They are also the primer owner of hydroelectric power plants, which produce a consistent source of electricity. BEPC has a strong management team and owns valuable assets that will greatly appreciate in value as government incentives expand around renewable energy consumption. They also pay a nice dividend. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Disney** **(DIS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.03%**\n\ngain/loss: **50.06%** **gain** \n\nI\u2019m invested in Disney mostly for some portfolio diversity. I\u2019m a big fan of their streaming platform and business strategy revolving around that. This one isn\u2019t climate change related so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**First** **Solar** **(FSLR)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.84%**\n\ngain/loss: **70.47%** **gain**\n\nFirst Solar is an American based panel manufacturer and projects operator. They used differentiated technology with Cadmoum Telluride panels, which are supposed to increase output and lifetime at a higher cost. FSLR is just another play on the growing solar industry, and being U.S. based seems to reward them a higher earnings multiple in the market than their peers. They also have a beautiful balance sheet. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Trulieve** **Cannabis** **(TCNFF)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.44%**\n\ngain/loss: **5.33%** **gain**\n\nTrulieve is another Cannabis play. This one based in the U.S. with a large medical market in Florida. Nuff said. (Do your own research) \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**Star** **Peak** **Energy** **Transition** **(STPK)**\n\nportfolio weight **1.43%**\n\ngain/loss: **55.45%** **gain**\n\nStar peak is a brand new holding for me and already shot up like crazy. It\u2019s one of these merger companies (the word is censored on this subreddit). merging with Stem energy storage. Stem is involved in the battery storage industry, with mostly grid level storage systems. They currently have an even larger market share than Tesla and my reason for holding this stock is mostly as a hedge against Tesla\u2019s energy business. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Shopify** **(SHOP)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.10%**\n\ngain/loss: **18.19%** **gain**\n\nShopify is an eCommerce platform, which allows customers to seamlessly design their own website and process payments.

When my grandpa passed away in March, I inherited $30,000. I had $10,000 saved up as well from working the prior summer and that $10,000 was already invested in the stock market. In high school I found out about stocks in my economics class and the day I turned 18 I invested every penny I had. \n\nOnce again, I am privileged to be able to invest this money at all.. I have a college fund to pay my tuition, I don\u2019t have to worry about when my next meal is coming, and I have the freedom to spend my money as I choose. \n\nAnyways, in March &amp; April when the market crashed I decided it was time to really dive into the stock market. I spent about 5 hours every day researching companies and I\u2019m here to share what I\u2019ve learned. \n\nIn my opinion, **the** **companies** **you** **invest** **in** **should** **be** **an** **extension** **of** **your** **worldview.** Where do you think the world will be in 10 years+ and what industries will prosper from the change. As I was raised in a liberal family and hold these values, I\u2019m quite concerned with **Climate** **Change**. I\u2019ve taken college classes in this realm since and learned more about the risks we face. I believe that any company whose mission revolves around mitigating the climate crisis will prosper in the coming decades. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ll list the companies I hold and a very brief synopsis of what they do and why I hold their stock. **Please** **do** **your** **own** **research**; this is only meant to introduce young investors to a certain mindset that I hold and the companies that I choose to support. \n\n--------------------------\n\n**Tesla** **(TSLA)** \n\nportfolio weight: **22.86%**\n\ngain/loss **1026%** **gain**\n\nYou guys all know what Tesla is about. They are the premier EV company with goals of cutting battery costs by 56% and producing 20,000,000+ cars in the decade. They also have a growing energy business with solar roofs, panels, battery storage and an autobidder software. Tesla is priced insanely high by traditional metrics. If these metrics are your investing style then it\u2019s not for you. If you\u2019re like me, and you look for companies to hold for decades then I believe Tesla is one of the best investments out there. What other company will benefit from the transition to renewables in response to climate change and changing political conditions?\n\n----------------------------------\n\n**MP** **Materials** **(MP)**\n\nportfolio weight: **12.68%**\n\ngain/loss: **197%**  **gain**\n\nMP is the only active rare earth mineral miner in the U.S. They produce neodymium concentrates which are important components in NDPR magnets; used in EV motors, wind turbines, electronics &amp; much more. \n\nI bought MP during their early pre-merger days and have already seen considerable profits in a few months. I\u2019ve been shaving this position to keep it around 10% because it is a commodity play which can be quite risky. That being said, rare earths are expected to appreciate substantially in price as EV demand increases. Furthermore, MP is moving downstream to refine their rare earths themselves, as they currently ship them to China to be refined, and in the future they plan on manufacturing their own NDPR batteries. This will increase their margins greatly. \n\n----------------------------------\n\n**Planet** **13** **(PLNHF)**\n\nportfolio weight **5.35%**\n\ngain/loss: **147.71** **gain**\n\nThis one is a MJ stock and I\u2019m focusing mostly on my Climate Change investments on this post so I\u2019ll keep it brief. They own a superstore in Vegas and have their own brands. I believe the MJ industry is going to explode soon and PLNHF will benefit. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**Jinko** **Solar** **(JKS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **4.91%**\n\ngain/loss: **268.88%** **gain**\n\nJinko Solar is a leading solar panel manufacturer in China. They\u2019ve seen market consolidation in China and are poised to benefit from increasing demand and incentives around solar energy. Specifically, South East Asia is expected to see dramatic growth in renewables as China/India are responsible for a large portion of global emissions and are also seeing considerable growth in GDP and population. It\u2019s a play on the South East Asian economy and renewable industry. \n\n-------------------------------------\n\n**SolarEdge** **(SEDG)**:\n\nportfolio weight: **4.89%**\n\ngain/loss: **108.5%** **gain**\n\nSolarEdge is the global leader in panel inverters, which turn the sun\u2019s D.C. current into usable electricity for households (A.C. current). The inverter space is a much more consolidated industry with higher margins than panels. They trade at a more expensive multiple and are expected to see dramatic top and bottom line growth in the coming years. Solar panels need inverters to perform; simple as that. With fewer companies focused on this space, I expect the top players to have a large market share and grow along with the solar energy market. SEDG is also expanding into the energy storage and EV charging markets with recent acquisitions. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**Enphase** **Energy** **(ENPH)**\n\nportfolio weight: **4.43%** \n\ngain/loss: **203.08%** **gain**\n\nEnphase is also in the inverter market, with their differentiated microinverters. Micro Inverters are generally used in smaller systems and optimal for residential solar. Everything said above about the inverter market is true for Enphase as well. Enphase\u2019s business goes beyond inverters though. They are targeting a full residential energy ecosystem, with storage and their \u201cEnlighten\u201d software App, which will manage home energy usage and sell excess energy back to the grid. Enphase is very much a play on a future decentralized microgrid, with homes trading energy to each other as prices fluctuate. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**Canadian** **Solar** **(CSIQ)**\n\nportfolio weight: **4.42%**\n\ngain/loss: **118.32%** *gain**\n\nCanadian Solar is another panel manufacturing company. They are also seeing growth in market share as smaller players struggle during the pandemic. CSIQ is a low cost producer with residential, commercial and grid level projects. They are planning on expanding their recurring revenue stream through full and partial ownership of solar projects. You can read more about this on the IR page. CSIQ is a pure solar play with an international footprint and vast management expertise. They will certainly benefit from any movement towards renewables, especially if legislation is passed to set a price on carbon. \n\n--------------------------\n\n**Lemonade** **LMND** \n\nportfolio weight: **3.93%**\n\ngain/loss: **112.52** **gain**\n\nLemonade is not a climate change related investment. It\u2019s highly speculative but I think their management team and business model is really cool so I put some money in (and quickly more than doubled it). I\u2019ll be brief here, but basically they are a home/renter/pet insurance company that takes a flat 25% cut of premiums as revenue and uses the remaining money to pay out claims. They aim to align incentives by donating anything left over beyond the 25% to a charity of customers choosing. Also, their use of AI makes the registration and claims process seamless and \u201cdelights\u201d customers. \n\n----------------------------\n\n**TPI** **Composites** **(TPIC)**\n\nportfolio weight: **3.73%**\n\ngain/loss: **153.99%** **gain**\n\nTPIC manufacturers wind blade composites. They supply the top five wind turbine companies outside of China. I wrote about them on prior posts so I\u2019ll just copy &amp; paste here:\n63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with Workhorse to manufacture vehicle parts for them.\n-----------------------------\n\n**Skyworks** **Solutions** **(SWKS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.83%**\n\ngain/loss: **60.57%** **gain**\n\nSkyworks is a semiconductor focused on connectivity chips for all kinds of devices. They aren\u2019t climate change related which is the point of this post so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Tattooed** **Chef** **(TTCF)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.65%**\n\ngain/loss: **55.90** **gain**\n\nTattooed Chef is a play on the rising plant-based food trend. They make a variety of frozen food items, widely available in Walmart, Costco and Target. They are expanding into Whole Foods, Trader Joe\u2019s and many more stores, where I expect them to be very successful. The plant based market is exploding for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there is more research on the health benefits of a plant based diet, with athletes such as Chris Paul &amp; Todd Gurley endorsing these brands. Also, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the threat of climate change and how avoiding red meat can have a positive impact on the planet. I expect TTCF to benefit off of these trends and continue innovating in the plant-based space. I bought in 3 weeks ago and the price has exploded since then. \n\n-------------------------\n\n**Workhorse** **(WKHS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.60%**\n\ngain/loss: **35.90%** **gain**\n\nWorkhorse is an electric delivery van company. They manufacture last mile electric vehicles and are developing drones to further decrease last mile delivery costs. They are a play on the e-commerce industry and electrification of vehicles. I\u2019m invested in them because last mile delivery is responsible for a large chunk of transportation carbon emissions and in desperate need of electrification. I also believe that Workhorse will get a large chunk of the upcoming USPS contract which will provide a stable revenue stream.\n---------------------\n\n**Aphria** **(APHA)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.45%**\n\ngain/loss: **53%** **gain**\n\nAphria is another MJ play for me. Once again they aren\u2019t a climate change investment so I\u2019ll keep it brief. They just finalized a merger with Tilray, making them the biggest cannabis producer in the world. They are based in Canada and I believe they will be the market leader in Europe, due to their infrastructure advantage through owning CC Pharma.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Vestas** **Wind** **Systems** **(VWDRY)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.40%**\n\ngain/loss: **197.44%** **gain**\n\nVestas is the global leader in wind turbine manufacturing and installation. They are one of the few pure wind plays in the stock market, making them an attractive choice for anybody looking to get exposure to wind. A big driver if future growth will be their service and maintainace business, which their management team has been focused on in recent quarters. This is a higher margin business with consistent recurring revenues. \n\n----------------------------\n\n**Facebook** **(FB)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.38%**\n\ngain/loss: **20.61%** **gain\n\nI\u2019m selling out of FB very soon but I still hold them for now. FB is an incredible business and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll see growth in the future, but it just isn\u2019t for me (anymore). I consider ethics a lot in my investments, which many of you may consider stupid but idc. \n\n---------------------------\n\n**Hannon** **Armstrong** **(HASI)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.18%**\n\ngain/loss: **57.40%** **gain**\n\nHASI is a REIT, which solely makes climate change related investments. They invest in the land under solar projects, energy efficient buildings and much more. HASI is a great dividend play and I expect their stock price to appreciate as climate change worries are exacerbated in the future. \n\n---------------------------\n\n**Beyond** **Meat** **(BYND)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.10%**\n\ngain/loss: **21.24%** **gain**\n\nI made a post with some DD earlier this year on Beyond so I\u2019ll just link that below:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/if9tmj/beyond_meat_bynd_fundamental_analysis_with_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n---------------------------\n\n**Brookefield** **Renewable** **Partners** **(BEPC)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.06%**\n\ngain/loss: **87.23%** **gain**\n\nBEPC owns and operates a portfolio of renewable energy assets. Earlier this year they completed a merger with Terraform Power, expanding their solar &amp; wind footprint. They are also the primer owner of hydroelectric power plants, which produce a consistent source of electricity. BEPC has a strong management team and owns valuable assets that will greatly appreciate in value as government incentives expand around renewable energy consumption. They also pay a nice dividend. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Disney** **(DIS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.03%**\n\ngain/loss: **50.06%** **gain** \n\nI\u2019m invested in Disney mostly for some portfolio diversity. I\u2019m a big fan of their streaming platform and business strategy revolving around that. This one isn\u2019t climate change related so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**First** **Solar** **(FSLR)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.84%**\n\ngain/loss: **70.47%** **gain**\n\nFirst Solar is an American based panel manufacturer and projects operator. They used differentiated technology with Cadmoum Telluride panels, which are supposed to increase output and lifetime at a higher cost. FSLR is just another play on the growing solar industry, and being U.S. based seems to reward them a higher earnings multiple in the market than their peers. They also have a beautiful balance sheet. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Trulieve** **Cannabis** **(TCNFF)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.44%**\n\ngain/loss: **5.33%** **gain**\n\nTrulieve is another Cannabis play. This one based in the U.S. with a large medical market in Florida. Nuff said. (Do your own research) \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**Star** **Peak** **Energy** **Transition** **(STPK)**\n\nportfolio weight **1.43%**\n\ngain/loss: **55.45%** **gain**\n\nStar peak is a brand new holding for me and already shot up like crazy. It\u2019s one of these merger companies (the word is censored on this subreddit). merging with Stem energy storage. Stem is involved in the battery storage industry, with mostly grid level storage systems. They currently have an even larger market share than Tesla and my reason for holding this stock is mostly as a hedge against Tesla\u2019s energy business. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Shopify** **(SHOP)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.10%**\n\ngain/loss: **18.19%** **gain**\n\nShopify is an eCommerce platform, which allows customers to seamlessly design their own website and process payments. I\u2019ve used Shopify in the past and am a big fan of the business, which is a big part of why I\u2019m invested. They have a steep valuation but I plan on holding for 10+ years. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTotal gain: **181.52%**\n\n(Note: I\u2019ve taken some profits on a few of my stocks so the unrealized gain from my current holdings is less than my \u201ctotal\u201d gain by a few % points.)\n\n--------------------------\n\nYes, I\u2019m young and idealistic and have a lot to learn but I do know a few things.

Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market.**\n\n **\\~Very Long Post\\~** \n\nHello everyone and Good Morning!  So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the tech heavy [Nasdaq](https://ibb.co/ryVyyKt) up more than 0.5% and closing at a new all-time high, while the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/X31XLDq) finished down 0.21% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qB2m8Jm) lagged behind, finishing the day with a 200 points loss, its biggest loss in December. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Qkw3MBK) trending down after that huge spike in volatility on Monday as more than 50% of companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/QXzWV6h) as even more companies continue to move below the 50-day moving average on about average volume. We saw only 2 [sectors](https://ibb.co/cT4Z90m) finishing in the green yesterday (Technology &amp; Real Estate) while the biggest losers were in the Energy, Financial and Communications sectors as small caps continue their outperformance in the past weeks especially growth companies, while large-cap value plays lagged the market on [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/9VGmwtC).\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/34wtTb6) from yesterday, and you can that [Apple](https://ibb.co/dmNdcRy) pushed even higher, gaining almost 3% again after the reports earlier in the week of the company moving towards an EV or Self-Driving Technology play while [Tesla](https://ibb.co/r6d3Zvp) is approaching correction territory very fast as we also saw a lot more companies losing ground with big losers like Alibaba, Chevron, FB and many more.\n\nWe also got some economic data numbers yesterday as the consumer [confidence](https://ibb.co/PTT4BbQ) dropped to under 90, way below the 97 levels expected and 92.9 in the previous month. This was a result of a decline in the present situation confidence of the consumers due to the more uncertainty in the cold months. With home [sales](https://ibb.co/9TNmp0B) also falling more than expected but are still more than 25% up from a year ago with price also increasing by more than 14%.\n\nBut we did see an [improved](https://ibb.co/VxtKTwR) Q3 GDP revision up 0.3%, with most of the growth coming from [private](https://ibb.co/dcV1HkX) good &amp; services, with 21 of the 22 industry [groups](https://ibb.co/LJDSsLW) contributing as Durable Good and Health Care helped the most, while utilities did almost nothing and mining was a negative for the US Economy.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/3cGf7HN) we have tons of economic data coming in, starting with initial and continuing jobless claims, consumer spending, core inflation, consumer sentiment index and many more, this might give the stock market some direction depending on how the data comes in.\n\nSo, we saw a stunning turn of events late yesterday as Trump signed a [stopgap](https://ibb.co/ctsF0pn) bill again to fund the US agencies for another week, but threatened to not sign the [stimulus](https://ibb.co/9Wf6n9P) bill and [demanded](https://ibb.co/sFvMkNv)  bigger stimulus checks up to $2000 for individual Americans. I think this is really more of a bluff from him, as I don\u2019t think he can do anything at this point. Even if he doesn\u2019t sign this deal, it is very likely that Congress will act quickly as the necessary veto-proof votes have been reached in both the Senate and the House, as I think, it\u2019s rather unlikely, they can negotiate more than this, as Republicans will demand something in return. Senate Leader McConell has [already](https://ibb.co/Fsn4BQy) set up a veto override effort for next Tuesday in case Trump does veto the bill, so we will have to wait and see what Trump does today, as my belief is that he did whole thing just so people wouldn\u2019t talk about the pardons he gave out yesterday.\n\nIn some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/KDDZ01D), we also saw Vaccine companies like Moderna and BioNTech continue to drop after they were hugely bought as a reaction to the vaccine news in the last months, as the new strain is causing some doubt in them, but I don\u2019t think this is going to be a problem for them, but I do still think they are way to expensive at the moment, as I said in a previous post, I think Moderna doesn\u2019t deserve more than a $100 price at the moment. And I don\u2019t even believe that Pfizer which is nearing another [deal](https://ibb.co/ggtmmXc) to provide even more doses to the US is poised for big growth ahead, the one that I am keeping an eye on is JNJ, as their vaccine only needs 1 dose and is due to have some data for release early in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile Boeing received some good [news](https://ibb.co/c8d8xFj) as Alaska Airlines announced a better deal with the company to acquire 68 planes with options for another 52 in the future. This is very good news for the company as they have had a big number of orders canceled in 2020. Alaska looked to take advantage of the reduced order backlog and probably a good discount on the deal. So yeah, full disclosure I own Boeing and I think they will do better in the next years as they are still trading well below all time-highs.\n\nWe also got news from Store Capital as they announced [rent](https://ibb.co/YLpLZVg) collections of 90% in December, on par with the last months, this is a good read on the economy, as most business manage to survive these last few months of lockdowns before things will get better and return to a more normal life &amp; business cycle.\n\nAnd one last good piece of [news](https://ibb.co/NCB5bxJ) for us retail investors is that the NYSE approved the direct listing plan for IPOs, this will level the playing field for us everyday investors and will also provide companies with another path of going public.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/CPD8t3h) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 &amp; Nasdaq Composite leading the way.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

Biggest growth driver is as the primary System of Engagement for SMID sized businesses, which is something that few social media companies can rival (e.g. Pinterest and Etsy's audience are much more limited, which is not necessarily a bad thing but does mean those will not be used by say a local restaurant or contractor company, etc.).

Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco &amp; more. Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.\n\nWe saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.\n\nWe saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.\n\nToday we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.\n\nAlongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.\n\nOne good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week.\n\nInvestors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still\u2026 there is to much of a concentration in the bull\u2019s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.\n\nPositive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they\u2019re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.\n\nWhile on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.\n\nSo, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino\u2019s and many others from the food industry.\n\nAnd by the way, don\u2019t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.\n\nOne of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.\n\nWith the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can\u2019t get enough of this stock\u2019s, I don\u2019t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.\n\nToday we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don\u2019t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.\n\nSome other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don\u2019t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.\n\nWhile [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.\n\nAlso, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.\n\nI expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it\u2019s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.\n\nLikewise, [Dave &amp; Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren\u2019t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.\n\nWhile [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium.\n\nAdobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?\n\nSo, guys, don\u2019t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0).\n\nInvestors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%.

Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco &amp; more. Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.\n\nWe saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.\n\nWe saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.\n\nToday we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.\n\nAlongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.\n\nOne good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week.\n\nInvestors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still\u2026 there is to much of a concentration in the bull\u2019s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.\n\nPositive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they\u2019re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.\n\nWhile on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.\n\nSo, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino\u2019s and many others from the food industry.\n\nAnd by the way, don\u2019t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.\n\nOne of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.\n\nWith the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can\u2019t get enough of this stock\u2019s, I don\u2019t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.\n\nToday we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don\u2019t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.\n\nSome other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don\u2019t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.\n\nWhile [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.\n\nAlso, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.\n\nI expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it\u2019s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.\n\nLikewise, [Dave &amp; Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren\u2019t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.\n\nWhile [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium.\n\nAdobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?\n\nSo, guys, don\u2019t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0).\n\nInvestors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.\n\nJust be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP &amp; UP.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content!

Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco &amp; more. Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.\n\nWe saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.\n\nWe saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.\n\nToday we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.\n\nAlongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.\n\nOne good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week. \n\nInvestors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still\u2026 there is to much of a concentration in the bull\u2019s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.\n\nPositive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they\u2019re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.\n\nWhile on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.\n\nSo, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino\u2019s and many others from the food industry.\n\nAnd by the way, don\u2019t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.\n\nOne of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.\n\nWith the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can\u2019t get enough of this stock\u2019s, I don\u2019t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.\n\nToday we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don\u2019t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.\n\nSome other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don\u2019t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.\n\nWhile [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.\n\nAlso, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.\n\nI expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it\u2019s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.\n\nLikewise, [Dave &amp; Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren\u2019t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.\n\nWhile [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium. \n\nAdobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?\n\nSo, guys, don\u2019t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0). \n\nInvestors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.\n\nJust be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP &amp; UP.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content!

You can also see a lot of red in this map as not many companies did good yesterday except big tech names.\n\nSo, some TESLA [news](https://ibb.co/QpNsY6H), yesterday the company spiked to a new all time high at over 640$ as the stock soared over 7% again.

Tesla also just [announced](https://ibb.co/CJLCnW9) a sell of shares worth of $5B again as the company continues to raise more capital to fund the new factories and firm up the balance sheet while reducing the debt of the company.

Last week I closed out half my positions and left a few on the table waiting for them to hit my targets. Since I still have some of my positions open from last week I made my watchlist longer for this week to keep an eye out on plays that become within my level. I've also had a lot of DMs asking for plays that can be used on a smaller account so I've included some tickers that require less capital to sell cash-secured-puts. These are simply positions I might be entering based on my own due diligence and analysis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What am I doing?**\n\nI do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 4 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.\n\nI watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.\n\n# Here's a few things regarding my strategy\n\n**1.** I don't over-leverage with spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a \"Theta Gang\" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.\n\n**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.\n\n**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.\n\n**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling and shares!\n\nHonestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.\n\n# Open Positions From Last Week\n\n**FB:** 1x 18 Dec, 2020 $260 put sold to open. Up 50% on this option I sold, looking to sell early this week if we get a good pop and close it out at 60-70%.\n\n**MSFT:** Holding 100 shares. Up 1.75% on the position. Stock sitting at $215, my short-term price target is around $218-220 before I look into selling the position.\n\n**NVDA:** 30 shares. Up 0.24% on the position. Looking for $550 here.\n\n**PTON:** 1x 11 Dec 2020 $101 put sold to open. Up 25% here will look to close at around 50-70% profit range.\n\n# Chart Rules\n\n**Pink Lines** = Trading range &amp; channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.\n\n**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.\n\n# Master Plays This Week (Stock price in parenthesis)\n\n**CRM Salesforce ($248) - Earnings theta yolo**\n\n[CRM CHART](https://imgur.com/uTjMgNF)\n\nCRM has been the powerhouse is customer relations management throughout covid. High quality product that is converting more and more businesses into clients. Earnings are coming up this week so premiums will be juicy. The stock has been consolidating in a volatile range for about 2 months now. Uptrend still intact and close to the $240 support level where we will find some buyers. I'll be looking to enter a position here.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 11 2020, $240 strike put, sold to open for $7.60 or $760 premium. Return: 3% in 2 weeks. \\*I'm selling the 0.33 delta put here. You can go to a lower strike and lower delta, maybe even $235 here and still get decent return.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT to $280.\n\n**TDOC Teladoc ($196)**\n\n[TDOC CHART](https://imgur.com/NC6WSKs)\n\nI entered TDOC a couple weeks ago and made a quick 2-3% return on my play in just 2 or 3 days after the stock price shot up. It's trading a little higher than when I entered my position last time, but still near the bottom of the trend channel (pink lines). I think anything close to $190 is a good entry point. I'll be keeping an on it and look to sell a 0.30 delta put option 4 weeks out if the timing is right.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $185 strike put, sold to open for $7.00 or $700 premium. Return: 3.7% in 4 weeks.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT to $210-$215\n\n**PTON Peloton ($109)**\n\n[PTON CHART](https://imgur.com/Rl0L7pJ)\n\nI already have a position in PTON open. I sold a put when it was down 6% in a single day last week. I think anywhere sub-$100 level there will be buying pressure to keep it up. When it broke out to $140 it quickly reversed back to the mean stock price and into the channel. Weird how that works ;) Looking at the chart would you buy the stock when it the stock price was going vertically up from $100 to $140? I try to avoid buying on vertical lines unless it's a vertical line down on a stock ticker I like. The trend is still up here even though it has wild swings. Eventually this ticker will lose it's juicy premiums when volatility goes down. I'll try to capture some theta in the mean time.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $101 strike put, sold to open for $4.45 or $445 premium. Return: 4.4% in 4 weeks.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT back to $120.\n\n**FSLY Fastly ($85)**\n\n[FSLY CHART](https://imgur.com/x0QFpVj)\n\nFSLY also trading in a range approaching that $85 resistance level. It might take off, but if it doesn't I will look to sell a put option around the $78 strike where I think we can find some buyers for the stock. This is another ticker that has volatile swings, but also has been trading steady in a range. Looking at charts like this helps me see where the stock is going and what it is doing. If you look at the daily or intraday you lose sight of these things because it has such wide swings. This will lead you to easily being spooked out of your positions or selling too soon.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $78 strike put, sold to open for $3.75 or $375 premium. Return: 4.8% in 4 weeks.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT up to $95.\n\n**PRPL Purple Mattress ($30)**\n\n[PRPL CHART](https://imgur.com/ccdQhGV)\n\nPRPL is outside the trend lines and outperforming and also right at the resistance line. Sounds cliche, but the stock will either continue up and outside the range, where I will not touch it, or come back down to the $26-28 range where I will look to sell some puts. IV is still high on this ticker and makes premiums good to sell on. Will need to see where the stock goes this week before any decisions are made.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\nWaiting for a dip and for the stock price to come back into the channel. Waiting.\n\n**GME Gamestop ($16)**\n\n[GME CHART](https://imgur.com/LjpQ9Ie)\n\nThe possibilities where this stock can go are infinite. Premiums sky high. Strong support at $11 and we have some at the $14 range. If we get another up day of 10% tomorrow I won't touch this stock, otherwise I might sell some puts 4-6 weeks out and try to capitalize on the crazy IV this ticker has. This is a higher risk, higher reward play that I am willing to take. Why? Short interest is sky high. When the stock price increases, shorts will cover their losses which will squeeze the stock higher. If the stock price goes down, we will see some dip buyers and also potentially some shorts closing positions for break-even.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** I will look to sell puts at an appropriate strike when the time comes. If the stock is up 10% Monday I won't chase it.\n\n# Long-term holds I am watching\n\nPLTR (Palantir) and AAPL (Apple Inc). Unfortunately AAPL has terrible premiums so I can't collect any theta on it, but I do like the pricing point going into the holidays. Some of the main tech stocks have been under-performing for some time. I think there is a good opportunity to get some before they begin to take-off again.\n\nI did some research on Palantir stock this weekend and I gotta say I like it.

And just between us, I\u2019m about to add a new high-momentum holding that\u2019s the talk of Wall Street. Who knew investing through an S&amp;P 500 index fund could turn me into such a market swashbuckler?\n\nMy standouts, of course, are tech\u2019s Bunyanesque five: Apple \ufffc (ticker: AAPL), Microsoft \ufffc (MSFT), Amazon.com \ufffc (AMZN), Alphabet \ufffc (GOOGL), and Facebook  \ufffc(FB). The S&amp;P 500 weights companies by size, which means when I jump into a trend trade without realizing it, I apparently like to go big. Earlier this month, these five briefly made up 25% of my index fund. That dwarfs the 18% weighting held by the stars of the dot-com stock bubble two decades ago.\n\nNow here comes Tesla \ufffc (TSLA). The caretakers of the S&amp;P 500 say they will add the stock to the index just before Christmas. By all appearances, they\u2019re not so much rolling out a welcome mat as they are diving out of the way while Tesla founder Elon Musk jumps a CybertruckDukes-of-Hazzard-style over the security gate and through the front door.\n\nSee, just over a year ago, when Tesla passed General Motors \ufffc (GM) to become the most valuable U.S. car company, its absence in the S&amp;P 500 was already glaring. But Tesla wasn\u2019t yet consistently profitable. What if its stock value turned out to be temporary market puffery? S&amp;P passed. Since then, customer demand for Tesla has been fierce, and profits, convincing. Also, Tesla stock is up another 775%.\n\nTesla is now more valuable than most major car makers combined. A year ago, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway \ufffc (BRK.B) could have paid cash to buy Tesla\u2014twice. This past week, the car maker passed Berkshire Hathaway in market value to become the sixth-largest U.S. company.\n\nI\u2019m trying not to resort to using outdated investing tools, like skepticism and math. But now that S&amp;P is about to make Tesla one of my top retirement holdings, I\u2019m wondering two things. First, what does the bull case look like from here? Tesla\u2019s value is now so high that car-making profits alone, even looking out a decade and assuming massive market-share gains, might not be enough. Where will the other money come from? And second, if Tesla\u2019s stock rise falters, can my S&amp;P 500 fund still shine?\n\nAs for bull cases, those are becoming a bit easier to find. Among analysts who cover Tesla, 35% now say to buy shares, recently near $600. That\u2019s up from 19% who said to buy back during the March stock downturn, when Tesla fell below $100, split-adjusted.\n\nAdam Jonas at Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight on Nov. 18, predicting 22% upside, to $540. The stock delivered that in just four days. Not to worry: Jonas also has a separate \u201cbull case\u201d price target, which assumes things go even better than the \u201cbase case\u201d behind his Overweight rating. That price target is $1,068, suggesting plenty of upside potential left.\n\nMore interesting than targets is the thinking behind them. Jonas\u2019 base case for Tesla assumes its sales will rise to 3.8 million vehicles in the year 2030, with operating margins of just over 12%. Bull case: eight million vehicles, with 20% margins. Compare either of those with the one million electric vehicles Jonas expects General Motors to sell in 2030, and you get a sense of why GM recently announced a surge in EV spending.\n\nMore interesting still is that Tesla\u2019s core car business accounts for only 43% of Jonas\u2019s bull-case target. He expects that Tesla will eventually make more profit per vehicle selling network services and insurance than from selling the vehicles themselves. Tesla buyers today can pay thousands extra for full self-driving capability, or to unlock faster acceleration, or to upgrade infotainment systems on older vehicles. There\u2019s talk of a subscription plan for battery charging. And so on.\n\nAll of that starts to sound rather Apple-like. One thing that has helped propel the iPhone maker\u2019s shares from 15 times earnings two years ago to nearly 30 times earnings now is that it has ramped up sales of high-margin services, such as cloud storage and streaming, to its vast user base, and it takes a cut of software sales through its App Store.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives says Tesla\u2019s gains have also been driven by explosive growth in China, where it has a massive new factory to make Model 3 sedans and Model Y midsize SUVs. Ives says China could account for 40% of demand in just two years. That adds risk of a trade breakdown between the U.S. and China, of course. Ives also expects sales to surge in Europe amid a regulatory push for lower carbon emissions. \u201cWe\u2019re going into a golden age of EV demand,\u201d he says.\n\nThat makes me feel a little better about being force-fed Tesla stock via index fund next month. But what if it turns out I\u2019m getting in at the top? Maybe value stocks can help make up for it. Value stocks have been outperforming the rest of the S&amp;P 500 since Pfizer \ufffc (PFE) announced excellent results for an experimental Covid-19 vaccine earlier this month.\n\nIf life begins returning to normal sometime next year, the thinking goes, Old Economy stocks that have been hit hard by the pandemic can rebound. Goldman Sachs recently calculated that if shares of the aforementioned five tech giants fall 10% from here, while shares of the remaining S&amp;P 500 members rise 10%, the net result would be a gain for the overall index of 5%. If the tech giants merely stall instead of decline, and the rest rise 20%, the index would gain 16%.\n\nI\u2019m still working the numbers on what happens if Tesla stock climbs another 700% by Easter, while everything else falls. One thing\u2019s for sure: I plan to brag that I bought low.\n\nSource: Barron's", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 933287, "public", "self", "Tesla Storms the S&amp;P 500.

I updated my plays on Monday morning with my positions.\n\nDue to the short trading week I will be looking to HODL all these positions until next week and maybe close out Monday if we get another pop. I'll still be putting together my game-plan on Sunday for stocks to keep an eye on just incase I close some positions Friday or Monday and free up some capital.\n\nKeep in mind Monday after I entered these positions they all continued to dip. **I was down $600** by mid-day of the Monday trading day, but I wasn't even sweating. I have good entry points and am prepared to HODL shares as always. Yesterday and today was some nice price action for my account as yesterday I regained my losses from Monday and reclaimed the green side and today also gave me a nice jump. Up $1,200 just today on my positions.\n\nThese are currently 'unrealized' gains because I haven't sold my positions yet and anything can happen.\n\n**New Position**\n\n**PTON:** Yesterday PTON dipped hardcore down 6%. It was too tempting to resist and sold a put to open when it was down 4%. It continued to dip some more, but I am ok with that. \n\nI sold the December 11 2020 $101 strike put for $3.6 or $360 in premium. Break-even point is going to be if the stock dips below $97.40, which I dont think it will get that far. If it does I'm completely ok wheeling this stock. It's got strong fundamentals and also a nice IV to collect premium.\n\n**Current Positions**\n\n**PTON:** Mentioned above.\n\n**FB:** Had a nice gain here, will look to close out next week if it continues going up. My strike is pretty safe here and I don't think it will be getting contested.\n\n**KR:** Shares + covered calls. This thing barely moves, but I do expect a very slow grind up.\n\n**LULU:** Going to exit this position next week if I can squeeze out another 10% gain. It's December 18 expiration so it still has a long time to go just for that 30% gain.\n\n**MSFT:** Shares. Slow and steady grind hoping I can get closer to my price target of $220 where it will meet the armed guards of the resistance.\n\n**NVDA:** Shares. Had a good little pop today, I still think this can get up to $550 before I close out my shares and look for new opportunities.\n\n**SHOP:** Shares. SHOP had a great today. Started the week at the bottom of the trend/channel and is starting it's grind up to the upper side. Looking for $1,050 before I consider exiting my shares.\n\n[Positions Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/4ZlNIfI)", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 926959, "public", "self", "I draw with crayons so you don't have to.

I updated my plays on Monday morning with my positions.\n\nDue to the short trading week I will be looking to HODL all these positions until next week and maybe close out Monday if we get another pop. I'll still be putting together my game-plan on Sunday for stocks to keep an eye on just incase I close some positions Friday or Monday and free up some capital.\n\nKeep in mind Monday after I entered these positions they all continued to dip. **I was down $600** by mid-day of the Monday trading day, but I wasn't even sweating. I have good entry points and am prepared to HODL shares as always. Yesterday and today was some nice price action for my account as yesterday I regained my losses from Monday and reclaimed the green side and today also gave me a nice jump. Up $1,200 just today on my positions.\n\nThese are currently 'unrealized' gains because I haven't sold my positions yet and anything can happen.\n\n**New Position**\n\n**PTON:** Yesterday PTON dipped hardcore down 6%. It was too tempting to resist and sold a put to open when it was down 4%.

I normally post in the Options sub-reddit but just like my portfolio that is diversified in 4 stocks, I'm diversifying where I post my plays. This week I have a few positions where I will be buying shares. I thought maybe you guys would like to see my plays.\n\n**Here are the last 3 weeks of returns**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Week**|Buying Power|Profit/Loss|Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|$75,000|$4,000|5%|\n|2|$79,000|$1,600|2%|\n|3|$81,000|$1,500|1.9%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What am I doing?**\n\nI do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 3 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.\n\nI watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**\n\n**1.** I don't do spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see spreads as a \"Theta Gang\" play and is still very high risk.\n\n**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss. \n\n**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.\n\n**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling!\n\nHonestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.\n\n# Open Positions From Last Week\n\n**LULU:** 1x LULU 18 Dec 2020 PUT @ $310 strike. Currently up 45% on the play.\n\nThis is holding a lot of my buying power. I'm already up 45% on the play on the run-up it's had so far last week. Waiting for the last 40-50% profit might be laborious since the option will begin to lose theta &amp; delta as the stock price increases. Up 45% in a few days why wait another 2 weeks for the remaining 40%? I will be looking to sell this option once it hits 60% profit or so.\n\n# Chart Rules\n\n**Pink Lines** = Trading range &amp; channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.\n\n**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.\n\n# Master Plays This Week\n\n**FB - Facebook**\n\nFacebook has been on a slow and steady uptrend staying within the pink channel. It's tested support a couple times on weakness and bounced cleanly off them each time. Stock price at $269 (nice) is currently at the lower range of the uptrend channel. I think we'll see some continued momentum upward. If we get another re-test of some lows I think we will find some support at $260 and again at $250. IV is pretty low for facebook, so buying shares and selling weekly covered calls at 0.15 delta for a little extra premium might be better return than put-selling.\n\n**Positions on the watch:**\n\nDec 18 $260 PUT sold to open. Premium collected: $610, return: 1.5% in 4 weeks. \n\nBreak-even price would be if the stock closes below $253.90 by December 18 (currently $270).\n\nOR\n\n100x shares \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**KR - Kroger**\n\nKroger has always been a boring stock. I've labeled in purple where Buffet announced his stake. The stock shot up after the news and has been range-bound staying between $31-$34 with a slight uptrend. I think KR will react somewhat similar to WMT's stock price with a slow and steady upward grind. If so, we are at the bottom of the channel looking for continued momentum upward. Kroger reports earnings in 2 weeks and might provide a little extra premium on some plays.\n\n**Plays on the watch:**\n\nDec 11 $31.50 PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $65, return: 2% in 3 weeks.\n\nOR\n\nIV is low again, so owning some shares and selling CC against might also be a good move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MSFT - Microsoft**\n\nClassic Microsoft, not really doing much until it does. This chart only displays the last 6 months, but zooming further out you will see MSFT only goes up, albeit rather slowly. Last 3 months it's been in a slight uptrend bouncing between the $200 and $215/220 levels. Currently at the bottom of the trend channel, and might see some continued momentum going up. Big time support at $200 if we do see a little dip.\n\n**Positions on the watch:**\n\nDec 18 $200 strike PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $240, return: 1.2% in 3 weeks.\n\nOR\n\nBuying shares and selling covered calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NVDA - Nvidia**\n\nI am very bullish on NVDA in long-term. This is another ticker that will benefit as the world shifts even more-so on the tech side of things. They have been server revenue massively and they are no longer just a gaming chip company. Very bullish uptrend even if another round of covid quarantines and lockdowns hit. I think we can see this ticker re-test the $560 level and have another break-out. Otherwise we might see downtrend back to $500 or $510. \n\n**Positions on the watch:**\n\nOptions are pretty expensive here. Best play in my opinion is to be purchasing shares outright.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SHOP - Shopify**\n\nShopify has been within the same range since June. A few times it almost broke out of the $100 level, but was pulled right back in. The stock price is sitting at the lower end of the uptrend channel and close to the $1,000 support/resistance. If it breaks through this time look for some confirmation up above and into the $1,100 zone. I do like e-commerce long-term and think SHOP is at the very top of this list when you think e-commerce.\n\n**Positions on the watch:**\n\nOptions here are also very expensive, I think I might purchase some shares and look for a quick 3-4% pop this or next week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll be posting an update tomorrow morning with more potential theta plays and what I've entered.\n\nTime to dial in your trading, let's get this bread.", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 920464, "public", "self", "I draw with crayons so you don't have to.

Still, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs, the five largest U.S. tech companies actually aren\u2019t overvalued.\n\nFirst off, these stocks\u2014Facebook \ufffc (ticker: FB), Apple \ufffc (AAPL), Amazon \ufffc (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft \ufffc (MSFT)\u2014are up about 49% year-to-date on average. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 is up just under 12% for the year. Before Sept. 2, these five stocks had an average multiple on the next two years of earnings of roughly 35 times, against 12 times for the other 495 stocks on the S&amp;P 500, according to Goldman Sachs data. That was the widest valuation gap between the group and the broader market since 2000\u2014before the tech bubble burst.\n\nLately, investors have taken note of the drastic surge in the five stocks\u2019 valuations. Since September 2, the group is down about 3% on average. Meanwhile, large-cap value stocks, judging by the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (VOOV), have climbed 5.2%. Now, the so-called FAAMG group is trading at roughly 31 times earnings, compared with 20 times for the other 495 stocks.\n\nMany on Wall Street are wary of big tech as these multiples would seem bound to continue falling after their meteoric rise this year, and as interest rates rise when the economy starts to see a more solid recovery. Tech stocks, after all, would see less of a benefit from a firming economy. Mostly, growth stocks such as these five tend to have idiosyncratic revenue drivers that aren\u2019t affected by changes in the economy\u2014while the revenues of value stocks like consumer discretionary are very much tied to consumer spending trends and economic growth.\n\nEvercore strategists recently said they only see S&amp;P 500 gains of roughly 5% in the next year or so because they don\u2019t expect big tech to outperform the way it has in recent history.\n\nBut David Kostin, Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief US equity strategist, argues in a note that \u201cfundamentals support higher valuation for FAAMG.\u201d\n\nKostin noted that the near-term earnings outlook for FAAMG stocks supports the current valuations. Goldman is looking for S&amp;P 500 companies to post a median annual earnings per share growth of 8% for the next few years. The tech group is expected to see EPS growth of about 17%.\n\nComparing these companies\u2019 earnings multiples to their near-term earnings growth rates\u2014which many analysts do to determine how fair a valuation is\u2014further justifies Kostin\u2019s point. Facebook\u2019s PEG ratio\u2014calculated by taking the stock\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio and dividing by its projected earnings growth rate\u2014is 1.2 times, roughly in line with in its five-year average of 1.1, according to data from FactSet. Amazon\u2019s PEG ratio is 1.6 times, notably lower than its five-year average of 2.4. Alphabet\u2019s PEG is at 1.9 against an average of 1.5, although its five-year high is above 2. Microsoft\u2019s PEG is 2, in line with its average. Apple is the most overvalued by the metric, with a PEG of 2.6 against an average of 1.5.\n\nWith the exception of Apple, these companies are expected to see EPS compound an annual rate between the midteens in percentage terms to above 30%. If investors are willing to pay top dollar for these stocks, earnings growth could continue to take them higher.\n\nAll five have dominant platforms that create seemingly endless synergies. Amazon\u2019s new online drug business, for example, offers perks to their roughly 70 million Prime members. This can drive adoption of the new offering, but can also drive new prime customers.\n\nThe point is tech stocks are pricey for good reason\u2014don\u2019t count them out.\n\nSource: Barron's", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 915427, "public", "self", "Facebook, Apple and Other Big Tech Stocks Aren\u2019t Too Expensive.

The tech group is expected to see EPS growth of about 17%.\n\nComparing these companies\u2019 earnings multiples to their near-term earnings growth rates\u2014which many analysts do to determine how fair a valuation is\u2014further justifies Kostin\u2019s point. Facebook\u2019s PEG ratio\u2014calculated by taking the stock\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio and dividing by its projected earnings growth rate\u2014is 1.2 times, roughly in line with in its five-year average of 1.1, according to data from FactSet. Amazon\u2019s PEG ratio is 1.6 times, notably lower than its five-year average of 2.4. Alphabet\u2019s PEG is at 1.9 against an average of 1.5, although its five-year high is above 2. Microsoft\u2019s PEG is 2, in line with its average. Apple is the most overvalued by the metric, with a PEG of 2.6 against an average of 1.5.\n\nWith the exception of Apple, these companies are expected to see EPS compound an annual rate between the midteens in percentage terms to above 30%. If investors are willing to pay top dollar for these stocks, earnings growth could continue to take them higher.\n\nAll five have dominant platforms that create seemingly endless synergies. Amazon\u2019s new online drug business, for example, offers perks to their roughly 70 million Prime members. This can drive adoption of the new offering, but can also drive new prime customers.\n\nThe point is tech stocks are pricey for good reason\u2014don\u2019t count them out.\n\nSource: Barron's", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 915427, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Facebook, Apple and Other Big Tech Stocks Aren\u2019t Too Expensive.

This was an awkward quarter for Apple. Investors are buzzed about the new iPhone 12 line, but the phones have just started shipping, and weren\u2019t available in the September quarter. Apple CEO Tim Cook said iPhone sales in the quarter beat internal expectations, but they were a little shy of Wall Street consensus estimates. Worrisome was a sharp drop in sales in \u201cGreater China.\u201d They fell 29% from a year ago. The apparent issue: China is ahead of the U.S. on 5G, and other phone makers already have 5G phones on the market. Would you buy a 4G phone now? Didn\u2019t think so.\n\nApple didn\u2019t give formal guidance, but it gave some solid hints. It expects iPhone sales to rise year over year, despite the late start for the new iPhones, with double-digit revenue growth for every other hardware line and services. Apple also expects a return to growth in China. And, by the way: Macs, iPads, and Wearables together generated almost $24 billion in sales in the quarter, up a combined 30% year over year. On a run-rate basis, Apple\u2019s non-iPhone hardware this quarter will surpass $100 billion. Services is approaching $60 billion. Apple bought back $18 billion of stock in the quarter. Stop worrying; Apple will be fine.\n\nShop! In the Name of Love: U.S. online holiday shopping is expected to grow 33% this year to $189 billion, according to a report last week from Adobe Systems \ufffc, based on data gathered from 80 of the 100 largest online retailers. Amazon (AMZN) didn\u2019t need to read that report. The e-commerce giant posted 39% sales growth in North America in the September quarter. But profit-margin guidance for the fourth quarter gave investors pause: Amazon expects to have $4 billion in Covid-related costs in the quarter, up from $2.5 billion in the third quarter. Also, this year Prime Day fell in the fourth quarter; Amazon notes that those aren\u2019t the company\u2019s highest-margin sales. But let\u2019s not forget that Amazon crushed operating-income guidance for the September quarter. It wouldn\u2019t be shocking if it did it again. Amazon vowed last week to hire 100,000 temporary workers for the holidays. No company has benefited more from the acceleration in online shopping.\n\nBuy Stuff Now! Online-ad platforms are also benefiting from the e-commerce surge. Amazon had \u201cother revenue\u201d\u2014mostly ads\u2014of $5.4 billion in the quarter, up 50%. eBay \ufffc\u2019s [EBAY] ad revenue rose 77% in the period. Snap \ufffc [SNAP] and Pinterest \ufffc [PINS] recently posted ad-driven earnings beats, spurring huge stock moves. So it was no surprise that both Alphabet [GOOGL] and Facebook [FB] blew away top-line estimates. Remember the Facebook ad boycott? Heh. It\u2019s not working. Google parent Alphabet has been the megacap laggard this year, with a gain of under 20%, but it was the star Thursday. YouTube alone had $5 billion in ad sales, up 32%. And then there\u2019s Google Cloud.\n\nIn Clouds We Trust: All that hype about the public cloud? It\u2019s understated. Microsoft \ufffc [MSFT] said its commercial cloud business was up 31% in the September quarter\u2014and Azure was up 48%. Amazon Web Services revenue rose 29%; Google Cloud\u2019s jumped 45%. The German enterprise-software giant SAP \ufffc [SAP] slashed its revenue outlook this past week, declaring itself determined to accelerate its cloud transition, and the stock lost more than a quarter of its value. There is a lack of pure plays on the public cloud. You could do worse than owning a basket of Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nDeciphering Jeff: A standard part of every earnings press release is the CEO quote. Usually the boss waxes poetic about the quarter, or raves about the company\u2019s engineers or huge addressable market. Amazon\u2019s release this quarter quotes CEO Jeff Bezos saying that retailers everywhere should match the company\u2019s $15-an-hour minimum-wage rate: \u201cWe hope other large employers will also make the jump to $15. Now would be a great time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a strange quote for an earnings release. A PR move to show Amazon is a solid corporate citizen? An attempt to embarrass lower-paying rivals?

Volatility has dominated markets in the last few weeks, with investors spooked by the uncertainty of the US presidential elections, a record number of coronavirus infections in the US and Europe, and a new wave of lockdowns across Europe.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) performed the worst, ended the day 2.54% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) ended the day 1% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) 0.52% down.\n\nYesterday after-hours, heavily-weighted tech companies, like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) reported their quarterly earnings. Though most reported third-quarter results that exceeded expectations, shares of these companies (except Alphabet) pulled back steeply today. After the strong performance of these stocks compared to the broader market this year, market participants had set their expectations exceptionally high. In other words, traders expected these companies to beat expectations by a much greater margin than they did. The earnings results for all these companies can be found in yesterday\u2019s issue of the daily recap. \n\nToday, the Federal Reserve announced it lowered the minimum loan size for its Main Street lending program to $100,000 from $250,000 and that \u201cfees have been adjusted to encourage the provision of these smaller loans\u201d. Demand for the lending program has been weak thus far, with the Fed having offered just 400 loans totaling $3.7 billion, out of the total $600 billion capacity. As many pundits have pointed out, many small- and mid-sized businesses have stayed on the sidelines from taking on more loans that they would eventually need to pay back during the pandemic.\n\nUnfortunately, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, there were 88,521 new coronavirus infections reported in the US yesterday, another record, and 9,540 more cases than were reported Wednesday. The trend this week is worrying, given that only last Friday, the US set its previous record for daily new infections. According to the Washington Post, The total number of infections reported nationwide since February is virtually guaranteed to reach 9 million on Friday, just 15 days after the tally hit 8 million. At least 228,000 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in the country.\n\nEurope is in the thralls of a second surge in coronavirus, with the continent now accounting for 46% of global cases and nearly a third of total deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO) Spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris, compared to last week, daily cases in Europe have risen by \u201cabout a third\u201d and daily deaths by \u201cclose to 40%\u201d this week. This month, both France and Spain have declared states of emergency, imposing more restrictions to try to ease up pressure on hospital ICU departments. In France, the worst-hit country, more than half of ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.\n\nToday is the last Friday before the US presidential election on Tuesday. Regardless of political leanings, the results of this election are sure to have a massive effect on the stock market, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how markets react to whatever the US decides.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an announcement Friday that it will allow U.S. cruise ships to begin a phased approach to resume sailing in U.S. waters starting this Sunday. \u201cAfter expiration of CDC\u2019s No Sail Order (NSO) on October 31, 2020, CDC will take a phased approach to resume cruise ship passenger operations in U.S. waters,\u201d according to the CDC\u2019s newly published \u201cFramework for Conditional Sailing Order for Cruise Ships.\u201d Cruise stocks spiked immediately following the announcement.\n* Electric automaker Fisker completed its merger and debuted at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. \n* Alphabet's Google must tell a district court how it will respond to a federal antitrust lawsuit by mid-November, with the two sides making initial disclosures later in the month, U.S. Judge Amit Mehta said in a brief order on Friday.\n* Netflix (NFLX) on Thursday announced a price increase for U.S. subscribers. The price of a standard Netflix plan climbs by $1 a month to $13.99, from $12.99. The price for premium plans jumps by $2 a month to $17.99 from $15.99. The single-stream, non-HD basic plan remains $8.99.\n* LG Chem, Ltd, a company that supplies battery materials to Tesla, announced it was given the go-ahead to the company\u2019s management to spin-off its battery business into a new entity,\n* Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday at the company's quarterly earnings call that private messaging continues to be the fastest-growing form of communication \u2014 with WhatsApp alone seeing the exchange of 100 billion messages each day.

Comes after US equities rebounded on Thursday from a big Wednesday selloff. However, S&amp;P on pace for worst week since early September, Nasdaq since March. Weakness largely chalked up to renewed coronavirus concerns, election uncertainty and lack of fiscal stimulus. All sectors lower with tech (AAPL-US ), consumer discretionary (AMZN-US ) trailing. Healthcare, financials, comm services (GOOGL-US ) faring somewhat better. Treasuries little changed to a bit weaker in belly of the curve. Dollar little changed on the major crosses. Gold up 0.6%. WTI crude down 1.8%, on pace for \\~11% weekly decline, worst since late April.\n* **Big tech results have received a lot of the blame for the pullback** even though the group reported beat on revenue and EPS and there did not seem to be any meaningful shift in the very upbeat fundamental and secular growth narratives. In terms of some of the sticking points, **AAPL-US** missed on iPhone sales and the later iPhone 12 launch weighed on China, **AMZN-US** guided Q4 operating income below on another $4B of coronavirus investments and **FB-US** highlighted looming risks surrounding engagement, platform changes and regulatory. **GOOGL-US** has bucked the trend with the focus on an ad spending recovery, expense control and upcoming cloud disclosures.\n* Busy earnings outside of big tech. **SBUX-US** beat and saw sequential comp improvement. **SYK-US** saw continued recovery in elective procedures but no guidance. **ATVI-US** beat but Q4 EPS guidance missed. **TEAM-US** revenue growth decelerated. **TWTR-US** beat on ad strength but mDAUs missed and it guided for higher costs. **CVNA-US** missed slightly on retail units. **HIG-US** beat on better margins. **FIVN-US** beat and raised on enterprise momentum. **DECK-US** had a big beat on strength in UGG and HOKA. **COLM-US** missed and guided below. **DVN-US** raised production guidance. **CAKE-US** beat and said comps have improved in Q4.\n* Nothing particularly incremental surrounding some of the higher-profile themes outside of earnings. **Worsening coronavirus trends** in Europe and US continue to grab a lot of headlines and have raised concerns about recovery headwinds. **Election uncertainty** another overhang as Biden's lead in the polls offset by the potential for Trump to deliver another 2016 surprise. **Fiscal stimulus** on the backburner other than the seeming breakdown in the Pelosi-Mnuchin relationship. **Central bank policy support** another area of focus following the ECB though there also continue to be worries about both depleted arsenals and fatigue.\n\n**Notable Gainers:**\n\n* \\+6.2% **RMD-US** (ResMed): FQ1 earnings and revenue beat;

organic growth ahead on big Latin America, Europe upside; guided net and organic sales up MSD against consensus for 2.1% growth; also guided GM ahead; analysts noted GM expansion a record which allowed strong brand investments.\n* \\+2.4% **FIVN-US** (Five9): Q3 EPS, EBITDA, revenue beat on billings upside; announced acquisition of Inference Solutions, terms not disclosed; guided Q4 revenue midpoint ahead, EPS slightly better; upgraded to overweight from equal-weight at Stephens, citing improve revenue growth visibility, faster mid-market/enterprise adoption.\n* \\+1.6% **UAA-US** (Under Armour): Q3 revenue, operating income, EPS all ahead; guided FY20 EPS, revenue ahead of Street; management also highlighted margin growth vs 2019 on channel mix benefits, supply chain efficiencies; analysts positive on MyFitnessPal spinoff as sign of focus on core business, management focus on brand elevations and profitability.\n\n**Notable Decliners:**\n\n* \\-19.5% **TWTR-US** (Twitter): Q3 earnings and revenue beat on stronger advertising though monetizable daily active users sharply missed heightened expectations;

noted store traffic well below prior years, supply chain constraints related to Covid, cost containment actions; analysts highlighted weak implied gross margins in Q4 due to expected promotions though larger inventories than peers a potential benefit going into holiday season.\n* \\-9.3% **TEAM-US** (Atlassian): FQ1 earnings and revenue beat; new-customer growth and billings among the bright spots; next-Q guidance a bit weaker than the Street; analysts noted report generally positive but concerns about decelerating growth and lumpiness amid cloud transition.\n* \\-7.5% **MGM-US** (MGM Resorts): Q3 EPS and revenue missed; analysts characterized Las Vegas results as soft though Macau better; noted LV strip recovery remains highly uncertain due to reliance on air travel and group/convention business.\n* \\-6.1% **FB-US** (Facebook): Q3 beat big on key metrics with recovery in demand for digital ads the widely discussed tailwind on SMB, eComm, Retail, CPG strength;

Comes after US equities rebounded on Thursday from a big Wednesday selloff. However, S&amp;P on pace for worst week since early September, Nasdaq since March. Weakness largely chalked up to renewed coronavirus concerns, election uncertainty and lack of fiscal stimulus. All sectors lower with tech (AAPL-US ), consumer discretionary (AMZN-US ) trailing. Healthcare, financials, comm services (GOOGL-US ) faring somewhat better. Treasuries little changed to a bit weaker in belly of the curve. Dollar little changed on the major crosses. Gold up 0.6%.

Market participants digested a record increase in third-quarter GDP for the US, a better-than-expected weekly unemployment report, new coronavirus restrictions in the US and Europe and a slew of corporate earnings for massive companies.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.75% today, the best performing of the major indices. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.05% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.44%.\n\nAfter coming off one of the worst quarters in US history, the economy rebounded, growing at its fastest pace ever. Gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the total goods and services produced from July to September of this year, expanded at a 33.1% annualized pace, according to the report by the Department of Commerce. The gain came after a 31.4% plunge in the second quarter and was better than the 32% estimate from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The previous record was the post-World War II 16.7% surge in the first quarter of 1950.\n\nToday, the US Department of Commerce released its weekly unemployment report, showing that another 751,000 individuals filed initial jobless claims, better than the 770,000 estimated by analysts.  Continuing claims, which refer to individuals that are currently receiving unemployment benefits who filed for unemployment benefits at least two weeks ago, was 7.75 million, slightly better than the 7.77 million expected. According to Yahoo Finance, this report represents the ninth-straight week initial unemployment claims have remained below 1 million and continuing claims below 10 million, a key indicator that the economy is recovering, though not as fast as many would like.\n\nIn Europe, countries are still struggling to contain the recent surge in coronavirus infections. Both France and Germany announced renewed lockdowns spanning for about the next month, though the restrictions stopped short of the draconian measures announced earlier on during the pandemic. In the US, the seven-day average of daily new cases rose to a record 70,000 as of yesterday, according to data compiled by the Washington Post.\n\nOn the vaccine front, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, said he believed it would take until at least January for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine. There are five companies (Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (ELY), and BioNTech (BNTX)) in the final stages of study for a coronavirus vaccine, with Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. having fully enrolled their trials, Fauci said. \n\nSome analysts consider the recent pull-back in the stock market a healthy inevitability, given the strong rally that took many stocks to all-time highs earlier in the Month. Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in a note to clients, \u201cMarkets have been baking in a lot of optimism: that the pandemic was under control, that the economy was healing, and that things would be back to something approaching normal in 2021. Those assumptions were always optimistic, though, and what we are seeing now is a reality-based repricing. As such, this drop is both necessary and healthy. Markets should reflect the most likely future path, not the most optimistic, and that is where we are headed.\u201d \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Today is going to be a huge day in earnings:\n   * Amazon (AMZN) reported better-than-expected earnings.\n      * EPS of $12.37 vs $7.41 estimate\n      * Revenue of $96.1 billion vs $92.7 billion expected\n   * Apple (AAPL) reported better-than-expected earnings\n      * EPS of $0.73 vs $0.70 estimate\n      * Revenue of $64.7 billion vs $63.7 billion estimate.\n   * Alphabet (GOOG) reported better-than-expected earnings and went up 5% in after-hours\n      * EPS of $16.40 vs $11.42 expected\n      * Revenue of $38.01 billion vs $35.35 billion\n   * Facebook (FB) reported better than expected earnings.\n      * EPS of $2.71 vs $1.91 estimate\n      * Revenue of $2.74 billion vs $2.7 billion estimate.\n      * Daily Active Users of 1.82 billion vs 1.78 billion expected\n   * Twitter (TWTR) missed user-growth expectations and as a result, the stock dropped 9% in after-hours. \n      * EPS of $0.19 cents vs $0.06 estimate\n      * Revenue of $936 million vs $777.15 million estimate\n      * Daily Active User of 187 million vs 195.2 million estimate\n* Disney (DIS) is closing its Disneyland Paris theme park at the end of the day as France initiates a fresh round of restrictions meant to curb a rising number of new Covid-19 cases. \n* Pinterest (PINS) exploded after beating-earnings up 26% at the time of writing\n* Pinterest (PINS) with several price target increases from Barclays, Wedbush, and Robert W.

After adjusting for stock-based compensation and other factors, the company reported earnings of 13 cents a share, up from adjusted earnings of a penny a share a year ago. Analysts on average expected adjusted earnings of 4 cents a share on sales of $383 million.\n\nPinterest shares jumped more than 25% in after-hours trading following the report, after closing with a 7.1% decline at $48.78. Shares were topping $63 in the extended session after closing with a 6.2% decline at $49.25; Pinterest shares have never traded for higher than $53.87 in regular trading.\n\nPinterest shares have more than doubled to record highs since the social-media company\u2019s last earnings report, which predicted much higher revenue and user growth than previously expected. The online-advertising market seems to have found strength despite the pandemic, as strong third-quarter financial results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP sent stocks in ad-supported online companies higher across the board.\n\nOnline-ad stocks also experienced a jump after Pinterest\u2019s report, which arrived 24 hours ahead of quarterly reports from online-ad powerhouses Facebook Inc. FB , Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG and Twitter Inc. TWTR . Twitter shares gained more than 5% in the extended session Wednesday, while Facebook stock increased more than 2% and Google parent Alphabet added about 1%.\n\nPinterest executives said they expect revenue to grow around 60% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, roughly in line with the 58% growth in the third quarter. Pinterest reported revenue of $400 million in last year\u2019s holiday period, so the guidance suggests sales of about $640 million this year, which again trounces expectations. Analysts on average predicted fourth-quarter revenue of $541 million, according to FactSet.\n\nPinterest stock has gained 165% so far this year, and more than 106% in the past three months, as the S&amp;P 500 SPX index has gained 5% and 5.4% in those periods.\n\n[Source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/surge-in-pandemic-pinterest-users-continues-stock-jumps-more-than-20-toward-more-record-highs-11603916620)", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 891335, "public", "self", "Pinterest\u2019s pandemic surge continues, stock jumps more than 25% toward fresh record highs", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jk0lug/pinterests_pandemic_surge_continues_stock_jumps/", "all_ads", 6, 1603930032.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Brothanogood", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_d29iz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1603933632, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jk0lug/pinterests_pandemic_surge_continues_stock_jumps/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jk0lug", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "news", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "866eb162-65e6-11e5-a903-1252b640afe9", "link_flair_text": "News", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 29, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/jk0lug/pinterests_pandemic_surge_continues_stock_jumps/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "pzjvKZqg07OHTGHk7SN6c558D34KYt7hxrObJcZENys", "resolutions": [{"height": 54, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/5Wo8st17YvBCNjdg9YAUFRcIzQmTUAAps0oZ8JejX5M.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c9c1c8f401f261e7a5eb1e35d5993f56c1d9634", "width": 108}, {"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/5Wo8st17YvBCNjdg9YAUFRcIzQmTUAAps0oZ8JejX5M.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41d81a82a55d9fe0d3248719f5942add43fb959b", "width": 216}, {"height": 160, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/5Wo8st17YvBCNjdg9YAUFRcIzQmTUAAps0oZ8JejX5M.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ecd138f2077df1c3ffbc288d20d2e6981ce1819", "width": 320}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/5Wo8st17YvBCNjdg9YAUFRcIzQmTUAAps0oZ8JejX5M.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a492b7c579eb0d9ca57da6d5558b928f02f9198e", "width": 640}, {"height": 480, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/5Wo8st17YvBCNjdg9YAUFRcIzQmTUAAps0oZ8JejX5M.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc66d6671d59ac093c0ad2eca60581347f6d77c0", "width": 960}, {"height": 540, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/5Wo8st17YvBCNjdg9YAUFRcIzQmTUAAps0oZ8JejX5M.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b7118a6602abbe8b3343f37d5dad09462dad0ab", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 640, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/5Wo8st17YvBCNjdg9YAUFRcIzQmTUAAps0oZ8JejX5M.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=676387f2e41199f9f1e9fba8c356261c46955fe5", "width": 1280}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1603933643, "score": 1, "selftext": "Pinterest thrashes earnings estimates while adding another 26 million active users, stock again heads for big gains after earnings and pushes Twitter and Facebook shares higher too.\n\nPinterest Inc. continued to experience a surge in new users during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to larger-than-expected profit and revenue growth this summer, according to a Wednesday earnings report that sent shares on another ride toward fresh record highs.\n\nPinterest PINS reported a third-quarter loss of $94.2 million, or 16 cents a share, on revenue of $442.6 million, up from $280 million a year ago. After adjusting for stock-based compensation and other factors, the company reported earnings of 13 cents a share, up from adjusted earnings of a penny a share a year ago. Analysts on average expected adjusted earnings of 4 cents a share on sales of $383 million.\n\nPinterest shares jumped more than 25% in after-hours trading following the report, after closing with a 7.1% decline at $48.78. Shares were topping $63 in the extended session after closing with a 6.2% decline at $49.25; Pinterest shares have never traded for higher than $53.87 in regular trading.\n\nPinterest shares have more than doubled to record highs since the social-media company\u2019s last earnings report, which predicted much higher revenue and user growth than previously expected. The online-advertising market seems to have found strength despite the pandemic, as strong third-quarter financial results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP sent stocks in ad-supported online companies higher across the board.\n\nOnline-ad stocks also experienced a jump after Pinterest\u2019s report, which arrived 24 hours ahead of quarterly reports from online-ad powerhouses Facebook Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 26th, 2020.\n\n# **There\u2019s a big week ahead for the market with an earnings deluge, GDP data and stimulus negotiations  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/theres-a-big-week-ahead-for-the-market-with-an-earnings-deluge-gdp-data-and-stimulus-negotiations.html)**\n*****\n&gt; About a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings, including Apple and Microsoft, but uncertainty around stimulus and the presidential election could loom larger for markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There is also important economic data on the calendar, with a first look at third-quarter gross domestic product Thursday. After the second quarter\u2019s shocking 31.4% decline following coronavirus shutdowns, the economy bounced back with growth of 32.5% expected in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly 170 companies report earnings in the coming week, with a diverse group of blue chips among them, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell, and Merck. There is also a big showing from large tech names. Microsoft reports Tuesday, and Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all report in a small window just after the market close on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFor some of these stocks that have run a long way, the bar for those stock to respond to good earnings is higher,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivative strategy at BTIG.\n*****\n&gt; So far about 85% of S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings beat estimates, about 20 percentage points more than the long term average. Companies have been reporting earnings more than 16% above estimates, and the expectation is that earnings overall will be down about 18%, based on actual results and forecasts, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.95% for the week, breaking a 3-week win streak as coronavirus fiscal negotiations dragged on and tech shares declined.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve offered compromises, the speaker on a number of issues is still dug in,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday. \u201cIf she wants to compromise, there will be a deal. But we\u2019ve made lots of progress in lots of areas, but there\u2019s still some significant areas that we\u2019re working through.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; His comments knocked stocks down a bit midday Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s been a muted reaction to earnings overall,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cSo I\u2019m disappointed, in a way, as a fundamentally focused chief investment officer, that the stimulus saga seems to be what it\u2019s all about day in and day out, hour by hour. It\u2019s the stimulus saga, the election looming and the Covid resurgence. Those three things have sort of made earnings a page four story.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; With a week to go before the Nov. 3 election, the market could be a bit more volatile, especially if the outcome looks increasingly less certain.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to focus on the state of stimulus. It\u2019s going to focus on whether the polls are tightening or widening with regard to the probability of having an unclear outcome, contested outcome or both,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s lead has narrowed slightly but he is still ahead in swing state polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe are experiencing a little bit of the calm before the storm here. I do think we are going to get some 1%, 2% daily moves depending on the news...I think you could see a 3% to 5% down opening the following day [after the election] pretty easily,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cI think the market has grown increasingly comfortable with a cleaner result, even if the cleaner result is an all blue result, which potentially would result in a higher tax regime.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market began to focus more on the possibility of a Democratic sweep, where Democrats take the White House and Congress. That could mean a bigger stimulus package, and some strategists believe tax hikes would be delayed until the economy is on more solid ground.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs we get closer to the election, we\u2019re likely to see more volatility no matter what the outcome,\u201d said Grohowski.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said investors are not adequately hedged for an uncertain outcome. \u201cActive managers have the most net long positions they\u2019ve had in a number of years because they\u2019re fearful of missing a year-end rally,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe options market in no way, shape or form is telling you people are hedged right here. The market is discounting a slight volatility, not expected to be persistent into year end.\u201d\n*****\nEmanuel said the options market indicates investors do expect some volatility but not through year end, as some investors began hedging for several months ago.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat we see by and large is again the bump in volatility. It\u2019s really only anticipating a 2% or 3% move in the market either way, after the election, and then the expectation is to likely moderate after that,\u201d Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; The final trading day of October is on Friday, so there could also be some added volatility as fund managers readjust their portfolios between bonds and stocks. In the past week, Treasury yields broke out of a four-month range. The 10-year yield rose above 0.80% for the first time since June, and while it could move higher, strategists expect its move to be contained.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/67jHHD1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/M13Rd10.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ROEcV0O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zqElHD7.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9iotJBk.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lrNGV86.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xGvBBYL.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tR0QKgZ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iXkAMua.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/80umQkP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4BQenwD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rZFBz4D.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq vs. Dow Outperformance\n\n&gt; You may not realize it, but while the Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up a ridiculous 28% so far in 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still in the red on the year.\n\n&gt; Below is a table showing the Dow and Nasdaq's annual percentage change since 1972 when the Nasdaq came into existence. Were the year to end now, the Nasdaq would be outperforming the Dow by 28.65 percentage points. This would be the third strongest outperformance for the Nasdaq on record and the strongest since 1999 when the spread was 60 percentage points!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/dowavg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/downazpctchg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/spreaduse.png))**\n\n&gt; Below are all years since 1972 in which the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by at least ten percentage points. The Nasdaq has posted an annual gain of 20%+ in seventeen different years, but never in a year when the Dow was in the red. Probably the year that most resembles 2020 in terms of the performance spread is 1979 when the Nasdaq rose 28.11% and the Dow rose just 4.19%. Following that year in 1980, both the Dow and Nasdaq surged again and the Nasdaq outperformed by another 18.9 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Interestingly, of the twelve years where the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by more than ten percentage points, the Nasdaq went on to beat the Dow again in the next year eleven out of twelve times. The only time we've seen the Nasdaq crumble versus the Dow in the following year was in 2000 after 1999's outperformance. In 1999, the Nasdaq beat the Dow by a humongous 60 percentage points. After that large gap, though, the Nasdaq ran out of gas in 2000 and underperformed the Dow by 33 percentage points when the Dot Com Bubble finally burst.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/outperfo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Show Slowing Pace of Economic Recovery\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) Beige Book presented qualitative data that suggested the pace of the economic recovery had been tapering, as we discussed in the LPL Research blog, Beige Book Shows Pace of Recovery is Moderating, but now we have quantitative data that is confirming the survey data. The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) increased 0.7% month over month in September to beat Bloomberg consensus expectations of 0.6%, but slowed after rising 1.4% in August and 2% in July.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the leading indicators are still growing, but at a slower rate than the blistering pace seen in the initial months after emerging from lockdowns.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.23.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Growth in the LEI in September was primarily driven by the improvement in jobless claims, as well as continued strength in building permits for new private housing\u2014a trend that matches the behavioral shifts to accommodate work from home conditions during the pandemic. The pullback in stock prices last month and manufacturers\u2019 new orders were the lone detractors from the LEI in September.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt comes as no surprise that growth began to level off after the surge over the summer, and the softer LEI print is suggesting the economy could be losing momentum heading into the fourth quarter,\u201d said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cHowever, despite the slowing momentum, we still expect solid economic growth in Q4, just not quite at the same rate in Q3.\u201d\n\n&gt; The decline in manufacturers\u2019 new orders is likely in relation to election uncertainty, which should prove transitory. However, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in both Europe and the United States may cause business activity to slow, even if no additional lockdowns are mandated. As we head into the fourth quarter, we will continue to monitor real-time data for any additional clues about the pace of the economic recovery.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Halloween Trading Strategy: S&amp;P 500 Up 85% of the Time\n\n&gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 26 years. From the tables above &amp; below:\n\n&gt; * Dow up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.05%.\n&gt; * S&amp;P up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.11%.\n&gt; * NASDAQ up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.67%.\n&gt; * Russell 2000 up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.31%.\n\n&gt; Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course \u201cSell in May\u201d. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac that most of the market\u2019s gains have been made from October 31 to April 30, while the market tends to go sideways to down from May through October.\n\n&gt; Recent market weakness has held off our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal so far, but it could trigger anytime now. Uncertainty abounds with surging covid-19 cases, a heated presidential election and persistently elevated unemployment. However, each day that passes is one day closer to a covid-19 vaccine. Interest rates are low and ample liquidity is available to support the market and the economy. Additional fiscal stimulus also appears to be coming soon. Debate continues on the amount, but both parties do appear to agree it is needed in one form or another.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/79a067fc10d5ee40688ccec4ecb3fe2d/5899f7da34b8b8c0-e3/s500x750/4b0222300348a79e152bf80a85a41faf34984e3e.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/120a6a895b102be90ac05d6d5cbcdf2a/5899f7da34b8b8c0-26/s500x750/94df00168310f90a644b7aaa6f94820f807a4080.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/545ec0f231cb05daf30bc162745dc559/5899f7da34b8b8c0-25/s500x750/d84cab3903b5c92e70d470a07c469e2d646d38b8.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a59dd0402f777bcb3f8fd3fb014a35ed/5899f7da34b8b8c0-82/s500x750/f54029e610ed2abc990f8b7c6ea9678925bc0a5a.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # \"Quitters\"\n\n&gt; Like an old pair of \"quitters\" that keep falling down because their elasticity is shot, the market has had its own trouble staying up over the last few trading days. Today isn't over yet, but if the S&amp;P 500 finishes around current levels it will mark the fourth straight day of finishing down at least half of one percent from its intraday high. Compared to the three days before, today's pullback from an intraday high has actually been pretty mild up to this point. Following Monday's 2%+ decline from the intraday high shortly after the open, yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 traded down close to 1% from its afternoon high. These two reversals followed Friday's late-day sell-off when the S&amp;P 500 finished the day down 0.75% from its intraday high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Last-Four-Days1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it's disheartening to see the market erasing early gains as the day goes on, it's helpful to put the last four trading days into perspective. Over the last 25 years, it hasn't been uncommon for the S&amp;P 500 to finish the day down at least 0.5% from an intraday high for four days in a row. The current streak, if it holds, would be the 158th such streak of four or more days. That works out to more than six a year. There have also been a number of streaks that were much longer than the current one. In fact, it was only a month ago that the S&amp;P 500 went 11 straight days of finishing the day down at least 0.5% from its intraday high, and besides that streak, there have been five other streaks that spanned ten or more trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Streaks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # October Optimism For Homebuilders\n\n&gt; Given housing inventories remain historically low thanks to still strong demand, homebuilders have plenty to be optimistic about. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has continued to show this strength as its monthly sentiment survey set a record high for the month of October. Back in August, the index tied the previous record level of 78 from December of 1998. Over the past two months, it has only raised that bar, coming in at 85 this month; 2 points above forecasts and last month's reading of 83.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The rise in the index comes on broad strength across each of the sub-indices. Present Sales, Future Sales, and Traffic all matched or made record highs in October. The only sub-index that was not higher was for Traffic, though, it was unchanged at a record high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Table1.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the look across each of the four US regions, the West and Northeast both saw sizeable upticks to new records, but sentiment in the Midwest and South were actually slightly lower. For the Northeast, this is the third record in a row. Meanwhile, the West's record high in October finally surpassed the prior high of 91 from October of 2005. Finally, even though sentiment fell in the Midwest and South, both remain at higher levels now than any month other than September's record highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Regions.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 23rd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.25.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$TWLO** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$FSLY** \n&gt; * **$PINS** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$MRNA** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$ETSY** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$LGND** \n&gt; * **$FVRR** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$RTX** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$OSTK** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$ATVI** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$SHW** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$NVS** \n&gt; * **$NRZ** \n&gt; * **$MRK**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8wcVG2D.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.26.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AaPzlgn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9GgF3Hb.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rwj1IS3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/k4Rx5gI.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YjH86d9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LUzqajk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/NcPneVZ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/AMyjDf6.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/312QBRU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/mjgt9Gs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZJ4Y4Vk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3pFmMuz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SZg9uyc.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IGm07VC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IRNiQEm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SLRmoZE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.30.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7OhLjkG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Apple, Inc. $115.04\n**Apple, Inc.

After the second quarter\u2019s shocking 31.4% decline following coronavirus shutdowns, the economy bounced back with growth of 32.5% expected in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly 170 companies report earnings in the coming week, with a diverse group of blue chips among them, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell, and Merck. There is also a big showing from large tech names. Microsoft reports Tuesday, and Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all report in a small window just after the market close on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFor some of these stocks that have run a long way, the bar for those stock to respond to good earnings is higher,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivative strategy at BTIG.\n*****\n&gt; So far about 85% of S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings beat estimates, about 20 percentage points more than the long term average. Companies have been reporting earnings more than 16% above estimates, and the expectation is that earnings overall will be down about 18%, based on actual results and forecasts, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.95% for the week, breaking a 3-week win streak as coronavirus fiscal negotiations dragged on and tech shares declined.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve offered compromises, the speaker on a number of issues is still dug in,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday. \u201cIf she wants to compromise, there will be a deal. But we\u2019ve made lots of progress in lots of areas, but there\u2019s still some significant areas that we\u2019re working through.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; His comments knocked stocks down a bit midday Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s been a muted reaction to earnings overall,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cSo I\u2019m disappointed, in a way, as a fundamentally focused chief investment officer, that the stimulus saga seems to be what it\u2019s all about day in and day out, hour by hour. It\u2019s the stimulus saga, the election looming and the Covid resurgence. Those three things have sort of made earnings a page four story.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; With a week to go before the Nov. 3 election, the market could be a bit more volatile, especially if the outcome looks increasingly less certain.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to focus on the state of stimulus. It\u2019s going to focus on whether the polls are tightening or widening with regard to the probability of having an unclear outcome, contested outcome or both,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s lead has narrowed slightly but he is still ahead in swing state polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe are experiencing a little bit of the calm before the storm here. I do think we are going to get some 1%, 2% daily moves depending on the news...I think you could see a 3% to 5% down opening the following day [after the election] pretty easily,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cI think the market has grown increasingly comfortable with a cleaner result, even if the cleaner result is an all blue result, which potentially would result in a higher tax regime.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market began to focus more on the possibility of a Democratic sweep, where Democrats take the White House and Congress. That could mean a bigger stimulus package, and some strategists believe tax hikes would be delayed until the economy is on more solid ground.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs we get closer to the election, we\u2019re likely to see more volatility no matter what the outcome,\u201d said Grohowski.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said investors are not adequately hedged for an uncertain outcome. \u201cActive managers have the most net long positions they\u2019ve had in a number of years because they\u2019re fearful of missing a year-end rally,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe options market in no way, shape or form is telling you people are hedged right here. The market is discounting a slight volatility, not expected to be persistent into year end.\u201d\n*****\nEmanuel said the options market indicates investors do expect some volatility but not through year end, as some investors began hedging for several months ago.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat we see by and large is again the bump in volatility. It\u2019s really only anticipating a 2% or 3% move in the market either way, after the election, and then the expectation is to likely moderate after that,\u201d Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; The final trading day of October is on Friday, so there could also be some added volatility as fund managers readjust their portfolios between bonds and stocks. In the past week, Treasury yields broke out of a four-month range. The 10-year yield rose above 0.80% for the first time since June, and while it could move higher, strategists expect its move to be contained.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/67jHHD1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/M13Rd10.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ROEcV0O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zqElHD7.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9iotJBk.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lrNGV86.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xGvBBYL.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tR0QKgZ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iXkAMua.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/80umQkP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4BQenwD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rZFBz4D.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq vs. Dow Outperformance\n\n&gt; You may not realize it, but while the Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up a ridiculous 28% so far in 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still in the red on the year.\n\n&gt; Below is a table showing the Dow and Nasdaq's annual percentage change since 1972 when the Nasdaq came into existence. Were the year to end now, the Nasdaq would be outperforming the Dow by 28.65 percentage points. This would be the third strongest outperformance for the Nasdaq on record and the strongest since 1999 when the spread was 60 percentage points!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/dowavg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/downazpctchg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/spreaduse.png))**\n\n&gt; Below are all years since 1972 in which the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by at least ten percentage points. The Nasdaq has posted an annual gain of 20%+ in seventeen different years, but never in a year when the Dow was in the red. Probably the year that most resembles 2020 in terms of the performance spread is 1979 when the Nasdaq rose 28.11% and the Dow rose just 4.19%. Following that year in 1980, both the Dow and Nasdaq surged again and the Nasdaq outperformed by another 18.9 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Interestingly, of the twelve years where the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by more than ten percentage points, the Nasdaq went on to beat the Dow again in the next year eleven out of twelve times. The only time we've seen the Nasdaq crumble versus the Dow in the following year was in 2000 after 1999's outperformance. In 1999, the Nasdaq beat the Dow by a humongous 60 percentage points. After that large gap, though, the Nasdaq ran out of gas in 2000 and underperformed the Dow by 33 percentage points when the Dot Com Bubble finally burst.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/outperfo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Show Slowing Pace of Economic Recovery\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) Beige Book presented qualitative data that suggested the pace of the economic recovery had been tapering, as we discussed in the LPL Research blog, Beige Book Shows Pace of Recovery is Moderating, but now we have quantitative data that is confirming the survey data. The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) increased 0.7% month over month in September to beat Bloomberg consensus expectations of 0.6%, but slowed after rising 1.4% in August and 2% in July.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the leading indicators are still growing, but at a slower rate than the blistering pace seen in the initial months after emerging from lockdowns.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.23.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Growth in the LEI in September was primarily driven by the improvement in jobless claims, as well as continued strength in building permits for new private housing\u2014a trend that matches the behavioral shifts to accommodate work from home conditions during the pandemic. The pullback in stock prices last month and manufacturers\u2019 new orders were the lone detractors from the LEI in September.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt comes as no surprise that growth began to level off after the surge over the summer, and the softer LEI print is suggesting the economy could be losing momentum heading into the fourth quarter,\u201d said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cHowever, despite the slowing momentum, we still expect solid economic growth in Q4, just not quite at the same rate in Q3.\u201d\n\n&gt; The decline in manufacturers\u2019 new orders is likely in relation to election uncertainty, which should prove transitory. However, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in both Europe and the United States may cause business activity to slow, even if no additional lockdowns are mandated. As we head into the fourth quarter, we will continue to monitor real-time data for any additional clues about the pace of the economic recovery.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Halloween Trading Strategy: S&amp;P 500 Up 85% of the Time\n\n&gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year.

These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac that most of the market\u2019s gains have been made from October 31 to April 30, while the market tends to go sideways to down from May through October.\n\n&gt; Recent market weakness has held off our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal so far, but it could trigger anytime now. Uncertainty abounds with surging covid-19 cases, a heated presidential election and persistently elevated unemployment. However, each day that passes is one day closer to a covid-19 vaccine. Interest rates are low and ample liquidity is available to support the market and the economy. Additional fiscal stimulus also appears to be coming soon. Debate continues on the amount, but both parties do appear to agree it is needed in one form or another.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/79a067fc10d5ee40688ccec4ecb3fe2d/5899f7da34b8b8c0-e3/s500x750/4b0222300348a79e152bf80a85a41faf34984e3e.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/120a6a895b102be90ac05d6d5cbcdf2a/5899f7da34b8b8c0-26/s500x750/94df00168310f90a644b7aaa6f94820f807a4080.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/545ec0f231cb05daf30bc162745dc559/5899f7da34b8b8c0-25/s500x750/d84cab3903b5c92e70d470a07c469e2d646d38b8.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a59dd0402f777bcb3f8fd3fb014a35ed/5899f7da34b8b8c0-82/s500x750/f54029e610ed2abc990f8b7c6ea9678925bc0a5a.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # \"Quitters\"\n\n&gt; Like an old pair of \"quitters\" that keep falling down because their elasticity is shot, the market has had its own trouble staying up over the last few trading days. Today isn't over yet, but if the S&amp;P 500 finishes around current levels it will mark the fourth straight day of finishing down at least half of one percent from its intraday high. Compared to the three days before, today's pullback from an intraday high has actually been pretty mild up to this point. Following Monday's 2%+ decline from the intraday high shortly after the open, yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 traded down close to 1% from its afternoon high. These two reversals followed Friday's late-day sell-off when the S&amp;P 500 finished the day down 0.75% from its intraday high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Last-Four-Days1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it's disheartening to see the market erasing early gains as the day goes on, it's helpful to put the last four trading days into perspective. Over the last 25 years, it hasn't been uncommon for the S&amp;P 500 to finish the day down at least 0.5% from an intraday high for four days in a row. The current streak, if it holds, would be the 158th such streak of four or more days. That works out to more than six a year. There have also been a number of streaks that were much longer than the current one. In fact, it was only a month ago that the S&amp;P 500 went 11 straight days of finishing the day down at least 0.5% from its intraday high, and besides that streak, there have been five other streaks that spanned ten or more trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Streaks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # October Optimism For Homebuilders\n\n&gt; Given housing inventories remain historically low thanks to still strong demand, homebuilders have plenty to be optimistic about. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has continued to show this strength as its monthly sentiment survey set a record high for the month of October. Back in August, the index tied the previous record level of 78 from December of 1998. Over the past two months, it has only raised that bar, coming in at 85 this month; 2 points above forecasts and last month's reading of 83.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The rise in the index comes on broad strength across each of the sub-indices. Present Sales, Future Sales, and Traffic all matched or made record highs in October. The only sub-index that was not higher was for Traffic, though, it was unchanged at a record high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Table1.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the look across each of the four US regions, the West and Northeast both saw sizeable upticks to new records, but sentiment in the Midwest and South were actually slightly lower. For the Northeast, this is the third record in a row. Meanwhile, the West's record high in October finally surpassed the prior high of 91 from October of 2005. Finally, even though sentiment fell in the Midwest and South, both remain at higher levels now than any month other than September's record highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Regions.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 23rd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.25.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$TWLO** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$FSLY** \n&gt; * **$PINS** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$MRNA** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$ETSY** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$LGND** \n&gt; * **$FVRR** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$RTX** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$OSTK** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$ATVI** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$SHW** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$NVS** \n&gt; * **$NRZ** \n&gt; * **$MRK**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8wcVG2D.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.26.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AaPzlgn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9GgF3Hb.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rwj1IS3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/k4Rx5gI.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YjH86d9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LUzqajk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/NcPneVZ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/AMyjDf6.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/312QBRU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/mjgt9Gs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZJ4Y4Vk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3pFmMuz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SZg9uyc.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IGm07VC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IRNiQEm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SLRmoZE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.30.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7OhLjkG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Apple, Inc. $115.04\n**Apple, Inc.

Market participants continue to closely monitor developments from Washington regarding stimulus, a better-than-expected unemployment report, and third-quarter corporate earnings. \n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) underperformed today, finishing the day even. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.56% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 0.62% up.\n\nHouse Speaker Pelosi once again expressed optimism that an additional round of fiscal could be passed before the November 3 election, even as disagreements on key provisions remain in the White House. Pelosi said, \u201cWe\u2019re just about there. The president wants a bull. That\u2019s part of the opportunity we have. Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were scheduled to speak on Thursday to discuss the deal, and the White House\u2019s last public offer stood at around $1.88 trillion for a stimulus proposal, versus the $2.2 trillion plan put forth by House Democrats.\n\nHowever, the proximity of the election and the lack of support for a bill in the GOP have market participants increasingly doubtful that a bill will be passed, fueling further volatility and uncertainty in the market. \n\nThe Department of Labor released its weekly unemployment report, which showed that another 787,000 Americans filed for first-time unemployment claims, much better than the 870,000 expected by analysts. However, it is important to note an increasing number of individuals have exhausted state unemployment and have rolled into longer-term pandemic-related assistance programs. This shows the devastating effect the pandemic has had on the labor market. \n\nToday is the second and final presidential debate between President Trump and Joe Biden. The debate will take place in Nashville, Tennessee and will begin at 9 p.m. Eastern time and run for 90 minutes. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is seizing tens of millions of dollars from top executives after agreeing to pay a $2.8 billion settlement to the US Justice Department for their role in the Malaysian investment fund scandal, commonly known as 1MDB. \n* General Electric (GE) stocks charged up 5.2% today,setting four month highs, after a Bloomberg report that the industrial conglomerate could sell off its majority stake in a steam power business in China.

Though Pelosi\u2019s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is \u201coptimistic\u201d about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.\n\nDespite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell\u2019s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump\u2019s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.\n\nIn other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans\u2019 attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in \u201call-or-nothing obstruction\u201d as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she \u201chas a prospect for an agreement\u201d with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. \u201cThere will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent \u2014 my goal \u2014 or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.\u201d It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Snapchat (SNAP) rocketed up today after posting better than expected quarterly earnings report.

The money will go to opioid treatment and abatement programs. DEA Assistant Administrator Tim McDermott said, \u201cPurdue Pharma actively thwarted the US\u2019 efforts to ensure compliance and prevent diversions.

However, also noted that big differences remain. While White House increased its offer to nearly $1.9T, Pelosi is sticking to a $2.2-2.4T range. Pelosi also noted earlier that the two sides have not bridged their differences on issues such as state and local government funding and liability protections. These are the same issues that have weighed on stimulus talks for months. Even if the two sides are able to reach a deal, there is significant resistance to a large stimulus package among Senate Republicans. Senate Majority Leader McConnell reportedly waned the White House not to make a big stimulus deal before the election ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/10/20/trump-economic-stimulus-pelosi/)).\n\n**AstraZeneca vaccine trial may resume in US as early as this week:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-astrazeneca-usa-ex/exclusive-astrazeneca-u-s-covid-19-vaccine-trial-may-resume-as-soon-as-this-week-sources-idUSKBN2752C5) reported AstraZeneca's (AZN-US) coronavirus vaccine trial in the US could resume as early as this week after the FDA completed its review of a serious illness. Trial has been on hold in the US since early September after a participant in the company's UK trial became ill with what was suspected to be transverse myelitis. However, it has resumed elsewhere, including the UK. Follows comments from Moderna (MRNA-US) CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel, who said the FDA could grant emergency use authorization to the company's coronavirus vaccine in December if it gets positive interim results in November from a large clinical trial. Despite some recent trial pauses, vaccine optimism has remained elevated. Pfizer (PFE-US) reiterated last week that it may know if its coronavirus vaccine is effective by the end of the month and could file for emergency use authorization by late November.\n\n**September housing starts missed on multifamily weakness while building permits beat:**\n\n* September **housing starts** came in at 1.415M SAAR, below consensus for 1.457M and August's 1.388M downwardly revised pace (was 1.416M). Up 1.9% m/m and up 11.1% y/y. Single-family starts up 8.5% m/m. Northeast and South stronger and Midwest weaker. Multifamily starts fell 14.7% m/m. September **building permits** at 1.553M SAAR above consensus for 1.515M and August's revised 1.476M level (previously 1.470M). Up 5.2% m/m and 8.1% y/y. Strength was similarly concentrated in single family permits. Comes after a record **NAHB housing market index** for October released yesterday. Coming up are Sep **existing home sales** (cons 6.25M, prior 6M) on Thursday, Sep **new home sales** (cons 1M, 1.011M prior) on Monday, Sep **pending home sales** (cons and prior 132.8K) next Thursday.\n\n**Earnings activity picks up:**\n\n* Following the latest batch of Q3 results, just over 13% of the S&amp;P 500 has now reported Q3 results. According to FactSet, 88% of reporters have surpassed consensus EPS expectations, well above the 73% one- and five-year averages. In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings more than 18% above expectations, much better than the 8% and 5.6% one- and five-year average positive surprise rates. Following the record beat rate for Q2 earnings and positive revision trends during Q3, there has been some focus on a higher bar. Companies leveraged to at-home trends continue to report some of the strongest results. The Street remains upbeat on margin expansion/protection given the softer macro backdrop. Guidance raises have also been fairly well received amid lingering Q4 uncertainty. Capital return announcements have been another bright spot.\n\n**All sectors higher, with energy, financials the leaders:**\n\n* **Energy** led the market, with E&amp;Ps and oil-services names rallying. **Financials** outperformed on strength from banks (particularly regionals) after latest batch of earnings. **Communication services** was boosted by the megacap internets (a bit of drag from telecom space). **Consumer discretionary** beat the tape with help from autos/suppliers, multiline retailers, and hotels/leisure. Transports, building product helped **industrials**, but A&amp;D was mixed (LMT-US ). **Tech** sector was mixed. Some strength from AAPL-US and MSFT-US but semis saw some decliners and IBM-US was down on its report. **Materials** was an underperformer amid some weakness in steel (STLD-US) and agrochemicals. Pharma was a weak spot in **healthcare**. **Consumer staples** was the only sector lower, with tobacco a weight (PM-US down after its report).\n\n**Biden up 9 points over Trump in latest national poll but Trump narrows gap in Pennsylvania:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/biden-trump-times-poll.html) noted that the latest NY Times/Sienna College poll showed Joe Biden up 9 points over President Trump. Added that Biden has a modest or wide lead over Trump on all of the most pressing issues at stake in the election, except the economy, where voters are now evenly split after long favoring Trump. While Biden has long held a solid lead over Trump in the national polls, the battleground polls have been tighter and fit with thoughts that the race is by no means over. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-battlegrounds-poll/trump-appears-to-cut-into-bidens-lead-in-pennsylvania-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN2742P9) noted that the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Biden's lead in Pennsylvania fall to 4 points from 7 points last week. In addition, Biden's lead in Florida halved to 2 points. However, Biden saw his lead over Trump expand in Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina, and remain unchanged at 8 points in Michigan.\n\n**DoJ set to file suit against Alphabet over Google antitrust:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-to-file-long-awaited-antitrust-suit-against-google-11603195203) reported Justice Department to file an antitrust suit today against Alphabet (GOOGL-US), alleging that Google engaged in anticompetitive conduct to preserve monopolies in search and search-advertising. Comes amid broader regulatory scrutiny on tech giants, with nearly all state attorneys general separately investigating Google, and House antitrust subcommittee releasing report that Google, Facebook (FB-US), Apple (AAPL-US), and Amazon (AMZN-US) all wield monopoly power ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-panel-calls-for-congress-to-break-up-tech-giants-11602016985?mod=hp_lead_pos3)).

Noted that with companies having already cut back drilling, laid off workers and written off assets, they are increasingly focused on M&amp;A to reduce costs. These trends have been driven by the demand headwinds from the pandemic. Industry has also faced pressure from years of elevated debt loads, lackluster shareholder returns, value-destroying deals, and climate change concerns. All of these dynamics have weighed on takeover prices as more than half of the shale deals this year came with a premium of less than 10% over already depressed stock prices. Following Cononco's $9.7B acquisition of Concho Resources on Monday, [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pioneer-natural-resources-is-in-talks-to-buy-parsley-energy-11603153466?mod=hp_lista_pos2) reported Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD-US) is in talks to acquire Parsley Energy (PE-US).\n\n**Democrats will go big on spending in the event of a November sweep:**\n\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/19/democrats-budget-plans-november-win-430169) and [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/upshot/biden-stimulus.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage) discussed how a Democratic sweep in November could unleash a big wave of government spending. The former noted that Democrats are already eyeing a special legislative vehicle known as reconciliation to disperse trillions of dollars in policy priorities, including infrastructure, clean energy, child care and more. The latter discussed how cognizant of failures of Obama-era stimulus, Biden and Democrats will look to go big on coronavirus relief measures. It pointed out that the package would likely be similar to the $3T+ measure House Democrats passed in the spring. This compares to the estimated \\~$600B of pandemic-related stimulus that would follow a Trump victory and Republican retention of Senate control. Both articles also fit with calls for a greater focus on the Senate races than the presidential contest.\n\n**Some high-frequency indicators suggest US economic rebound losing momentum:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/recovery-tracker/?sref=L75TRUmI) said that a number of indicators on its weekly dashboard of high-frequency, alternative and market-based data suggest the US economic rebound is losing momentum. These include jobless claims and restaurant bookings. Flagged waning stimulus, rising coronavirus cases and cooler weather as headwinds. Also discussed continued softness in public transportation and air travel. However, it did point out that a weekly measure of retail sales has continued to advance and housing remains a recovery bright spot. Morgan Stanley has said that even without stimulus, there is enough momentum in the recovery to keep the US economy on pace to return to pre-Covid levels of real GDP by the middle of next year.

It pointed out that the package would likely be similar to the $3T+ measure House Democrats passed in the spring. This compares to the estimated \\~$600B of pandemic-related stimulus that would follow a Trump victory and Republican retention of Senate control. Both articles also fit with calls for a greater focus on the Senate races than the presidential contest.\n\n**Some high-frequency indicators suggest US economic rebound losing momentum:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/recovery-tracker/?sref=L75TRUmI) said that a number of indicators on its weekly dashboard of high-frequency, alternative and market-based data suggest the US economic rebound is losing momentum. These include jobless claims and restaurant bookings. Flagged waning stimulus, rising coronavirus cases and cooler weather as headwinds. Also discussed continued softness in public transportation and air travel. However, it did point out that a weekly measure of retail sales has continued to advance and housing remains a recovery bright spot. Morgan Stanley has said that even without stimulus, there is enough momentum in the recovery to keep the US economy on pace to return to pre-Covid levels of real GDP by the middle of next year.

Fastly down 30%+ after a revenue warning. And Zoom rose to a record after its Zoomtopia analyst event. The year of 2020 has once again amazed me. I guess I \u2018m getting old.\n\nFastly reports preliminary Q3 revenue 70-71 mil, which is 5.6% lower than estimated 74.7 mil (Bloomberg number). This 5.6% drop in revenue triggered a 31% selloff, but I was not surprised about that. I knew this would happen one day. As I quote a [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/fastly-plunge-is-reminder-of-valuation-excesses-in-software) \u201cFastly\u2019s slowdown highlights the precariousness of lofty software valuations. **Massive share plunges are the price paid when these businesses fall short of perfection**.\u201d Exactly, **a perfect dream is destined to end in our imperfect world**.\n\n**Even though the FSLY lesson has come out, investors are not learning anything at all.**\n\n# Zoomtopia\n\nZM\u2019s meteoric rise surprised me. Ahead of the Zoomtopia event, on Monday, ZM\u2019s price was 491.54. Today it traded at a high of 563, a 14%+ rise. So what happened on the Zoomtopia event that has caused such a ZM euphoria?\n\nZM announced a couple of new features. One is the \u201cOnZoom\u201d , which allow users to sell tickets for their Zoom calls, so they can teach classes, hold concerts etc. for a profit. Basically, ZM is moving into the paid live streaming business. The other new thing is \u201cZapps\u201d, apps that run inside Zoom. For example Slack, now you no longer need to open Slack in parallel to Zoom, you can simply use Slack inside Zoom (with reduced functionality). **So basically, this saves you a couple mouse clicks** when conferencing. These announcements are certainly positive. The company would do better with them than without. But just how much better? Just a reminder, no matter how fancy the new features are, if they don\u2019t help make money, they would not matter at all. So let\u2019s think about how much money will these new features help Zoom make.\n\n# Long $ZM has become a new pandemic\n\nOn Wednesday, I was watching the analyst\u2019s call, via the Zoom link they provided. There were quite several ass-kissing questions, like what is Zoom\u2019s culture, philosophy, futures of our world blah blah. One practical question finally appears, when an analyst asked about **how Zoom plans to monetize on the new OnZoom and Zapps feature**. And the CFO\u2019s answer was, \u201c**This is new. We are not sure. We are looking at it. We will probably find out in next several quarters**.\u201d FYI, **Zoom is not taking a cut from the ticket sales. (**[**https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360050178332#h\\_01EMH8B5ND84F6XSSTPVKY75E7**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360050178332#h_01EMH8B5ND84F6XSSTPVKY75E7)**)** There is no evidence Zoom will take a cut in the future. **There is no evidence Zoom will charge third-parties to develop Zapps either**.\n\nHmm, Ms. CFO, you are not telling us much, How much money on earth are your new features worth?\n\n**When the profitability is an uncertainty to the company\u2019s own insider CFO, it has not been an uncertainty to the financial analysts**. A slew of analysts upgraded their target prices. RBC upgraded from 450 to 600. D.A Davidson upgraded from 457 to 600. And **Berstein, they upgraded from 228 to 612, a stunning 383$ per share increase, or a 75 billion dollar increase in valuation** (ZM has about 200mil shares outstanding). Ok folks WOW. In a professional analyst's opinion, **An online ticketing feature, plus an app feature that pretty much only saves you a couple of mouse clicks, are worth 75 billion USD**. Hey, remember how much money Oracle offered to buy TikTok? 20 billion. This values TikTok at about $50b ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bytedance-tiktok-exclusive-idUSKCN24U1M9](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bytedance-tiktok-exclusive-idUSKCN24U1M9))  **One Zoomtopia event, just pumped ZM\u2019s valuation by 1.5x TikTok.**\n\nIf Ms. CFO does not tell us how much more money ZM expect to make. Let\u2019s make some comparisons with existing, well-established companies doing similar business. Paid online courses website Udemy, one of the biggest, is valued at 2 billion. ([https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/online-learning-marketplace-udemy-raises-50m-at-a-2b-valuation-from-japanese-publisher-benesse/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/online-learning-marketplace-udemy-raises-50m-at-a-2b-valuation-from-japanese-publisher-benesse/)) Popular streaming services like Twitch, is worth 15 billion. ([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/amazon-media-assets-worth-500-billion-almost-as-much-as-aws-needham.html#:\\~:text=To%20get%20to%20%24500%20billion,says%2C%20is%20worth%20%24127%20billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/amazon-media-assets-worth-500-billion-almost-as-much-as-aws-needham.html#:~:text=To%20get%20to%20%24500%20billion,says%2C%20is%20worth%20%24127%20billion)). How can a feature in its infancy, increase ZM's valuation by more than the total worth of huge established companies? **Zoom\u2019s uncertainty has become better than other company\u2019s reality.**\n\nIf you say these companies are not comparable to Zoom's new ticketing feature, I've got another example. Facebook added [ticketed live streaming feature](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/626637251511853?id=1123223941353904) on Aug 14 ([https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2020/08/facebook-adds-ticketed-live-streams-waives-all-fees.html](https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2020/08/facebook-adds-ticketed-live-streams-waives-all-fees.html)), **pretty much exactly what ZM is offering**, And last time I checked, FB has more users than ZM? FB stock dropped on Aug 14 and 15. So why should ZM rise 14%?\n\nThere are also more rational and skeptical analysts apart from the Bernstein dude. Credit Suisse\u2019s new target stands at 315$ and Morgan Stanley at 350$. (tbh, I have not even heard of Bernstein or DA Davidson before. Morgan and Credit Suisse of course everybody knows). **But nobody is mentioning these. That is what people want to believe. Zoom has become their religion.** From twitter to stocktwits. the story of \u201cZoom to the moon\u201d is getting infectious. **Long Zoom has become a new pandemic.**\n\n# Tesla is saving the earth. Is Zoom too?\n\nMy story is not over. The massive increase in ZM's valuation is not the only absurd thing here, its valuation before Zoomtopia, was already insanity. **Zoom\u2019s FORWARD P/E ratio is at 211.9** (Bloomberg EEO next 4 qtrs est), and trailing P/E ratio is 518.47. In case you do not know what forward P/E ratio means, it is the P/E ratio for the next 4 quarters based on earnings projections, so it has accounted for the benefit ZM received from the pandemic. **Wait a sec. Tesla\u2019s FORWARD P/E is only 160.58.** ZM\u2019s forward P/E is higher than Tesla? Our world is warming, is on fire, and EV is saving the earth by reducing fossile fuel consumption. **Is Zoom, a video conferencing company, going to save our planet too?** Plus, **Tesla\u2019s P/E is high because its growth is yet to be realized. EV sales are expected to explode over next few years. How is ZM's growth going to explode after the pandemic is over?**\n\nOr do you really believe in a permanent WFH world? Do you really believe in a world where everybody is at home, downtown area is empty, offices are all vacant? There are success stories in battling Covid, like China or Singapore, where most people are back in office already. Also today **Pfizer just announced today its vaccine may be put in use as early as late November (**[https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-could-apply-for-emergency-use-of-covid-19-vaccine-by-late-november-11602842906](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-could-apply-for-emergency-use-of-covid-19-vaccine-by-late-november-11602842906)) But apparently, **market thinks this has no impact on Zoom at all**. It\u2019s true that some big tech firms can afford to have employees work permanently from home. But many of them do not use Zoom. Microsoft and Google both use inhouse tools (Team and Duo) and ban Zoom. Even if they WFH forever, does it benefit ZM? Moreover, **customers with fewer than 10 employees represent 36% of ZM\u2019s Q2 revenue** (Goldman Sachs research).

Fastly down 30%+ after a revenue warning. And Zoom rose to a record after its Zoomtopia analyst event. The year of 2020 has once again amazed me. I guess I \u2018m getting old.\n\nFastly reports preliminary Q3 revenue 70-71 mil, which is 5.6% lower than estimated 74.7 mil (Bloomberg number). This 5.6% drop in revenue triggered a 31% selloff, but I was not surprised about that. I knew this would happen one day. As I quote a [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/fastly-plunge-is-reminder-of-valuation-excesses-in-software) \u201cFastly\u2019s slowdown highlights the precariousness of lofty software valuations. **Massive share plunges are the price paid when these businesses fall short of perfection**.\u201d Exactly, **a perfect dream is destined to end in our imperfect world**.\n\n**Even though the FSLY lesson has come out, investors are not learning anything at all.**\n\n# Zoomtopia\n\nZM\u2019s meteoric rise surprised me. Ahead of the Zoomtopia event, on Monday, ZM\u2019s price was 491.54. Today it traded at a high of 563, a 14%+ rise. So what happened on the Zoomtopia event that has caused such a ZM euphoria?\n\nZM announced a couple of new features. One is the \u201cOnZoom\u201d , which allow users to sell tickets for their Zoom calls, so they can teach classes, hold concerts etc. for a profit. Basically, ZM is moving into the paid live streaming business. The other new thing is \u201cZapps\u201d, apps that run inside Zoom. For example Slack, now you no longer need to open Slack in parallel to Zoom, you can simply use Slack inside Zoom (with reduced functionality). **So basically, this saves you a couple mouse clicks** when conferencing. These announcements are certainly positive. The company would do better with them than without. But just how much better? Just a reminder, no matter how fancy the new features are, if they don\u2019t help make money, they would not matter at all. So let\u2019s think about how much money will these new features help Zoom make.\n\n# Long $ZM has become a new pandemic\n\nOn Wednesday, I was watching the analyst\u2019s call, via the Zoom link they provided. There were quite several ass-kissing questions, like what is Zoom\u2019s culture, philosophy, futures of our world blah blah. One practical question finally appears, when an analyst asked about **how Zoom plans to monetize on the new OnZoom and Zapps feature**. And the CFO\u2019s answer was, \u201c**This is new. We are not sure. We are looking at it. We will probably find out in next several quarters**.\u201d FYI, **Zoom is not taking a cut from the ticket sales. (**[**https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360050178332#h\\_01EMH8B5ND84F6XSSTPVKY75E7**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360050178332#h_01EMH8B5ND84F6XSSTPVKY75E7)**)** There is no evidence Zoom will take a cut in the future. **There is no evidence Zoom will charge third-parties to develop Zapps either**.\n\nHmm, Ms. CFO, you are not telling us much, How much money on earth are your new features worth?\n\n**When the profitability is an uncertainty to the company\u2019s own insider CFO, it has not been an uncertainty to the financial analysts**. A slew of analysts upgraded their target prices. RBC upgraded from 450 to 600. D.A Davidson upgraded from 457 to 600. And **Berstein, they upgraded from 228 to 612, a stunning 383$ per share increase, or a 75 billion dollar increase in valuation** (ZM has about 200mil shares outstanding). Ok folks WOW. In a professional analyst's opinion, **An online ticketing feature, plus an app feature that pretty much only saves you a couple of mouse clicks, are worth 75 billion USD**. Hey, remember how much money Oracle offered to buy TikTok? 20 billion. This values TikTok at about $50b ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bytedance-tiktok-exclusive-idUSKCN24U1M9](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bytedance-tiktok-exclusive-idUSKCN24U1M9))  **One Zoomtopia event, just pumped ZM\u2019s valuation by 1.5x TikTok.**\n\nIf Ms. CFO does not tell us how much more money ZM expect to make. Let\u2019s make some comparisons with existing, well-established companies doing similar business. Paid online courses website Udemy, one of the biggest, is valued at 2 billion. ([https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/online-learning-marketplace-udemy-raises-50m-at-a-2b-valuation-from-japanese-publisher-benesse/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/online-learning-marketplace-udemy-raises-50m-at-a-2b-valuation-from-japanese-publisher-benesse/)) Popular streaming services like Twitch, is worth 15 billion. ([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/amazon-media-assets-worth-500-billion-almost-as-much-as-aws-needham.html#:\\~:text=To%20get%20to%20%24500%20billion,says%2C%20is%20worth%20%24127%20billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/amazon-media-assets-worth-500-billion-almost-as-much-as-aws-needham.html#:~:text=To%20get%20to%20%24500%20billion,says%2C%20is%20worth%20%24127%20billion)). How can a feature in its infancy, increase ZM's valuation by more than the total worth of huge established companies? **Zoom\u2019s uncertainty has become better than other company\u2019s reality.**\n\nIf you say these companies are not comparable to Zoom's new ticketing feature, I've got another example. Facebook added [ticketed live streaming feature](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/626637251511853?id=1123223941353904) on Aug 14 ([https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2020/08/facebook-adds-ticketed-live-streams-waives-all-fees.html](https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2020/08/facebook-adds-ticketed-live-streams-waives-all-fees.html)), **pretty much exactly what ZM is offering**, And last time I checked, FB has more users than ZM? FB stock dropped on Aug 14 and 15. So why should ZM rise 14%?\n\nThere are also more rational and skeptical analysts apart from the Bernstein dude. Credit Suisse\u2019s new target stands at 315$ and Morgan Stanley at 350$. (tbh, I have not even heard of Bernstein or DA Davidson before. Morgan and Credit Suisse of course everybody knows). **But nobody is mentioning these. That is what people want to believe. Zoom has become their religion.** From twitter to stocktwits. the story of \u201cZoom to the moon\u201d is getting infectious. **Long Zoom has become a new pandemic.**\n\n# Tesla is saving the earth. Is Zoom too?\n\nMy story is not over. The massive increase in ZM's valuation is not the only absurd thing here, its valuation before Zoomtopia, was already insanity. **Zoom\u2019s FORWARD P/E ratio is at 211.9** (Bloomberg EEO next 4 qtrs est), and trailing P/E ratio is 518.47. In case you do not know what forward P/E ratio means, it is the P/E ratio for the next 4 quarters based on earnings projections, so it has accounted for the benefit ZM received from the pandemic. **Wait a sec. Tesla\u2019s FORWARD P/E is only 160.58.** ZM\u2019s forward P/E is higher than Tesla? Our world is warming, is on fire, and EV is saving the earth by reducing fossile fuel consumption. **Is Zoom, a video conferencing company, going to save our planet too?** Plus, **Tesla\u2019s P/E is high because its growth is yet to be realized. EV sales are expected to explode over next few years. How is ZM's growth going to explode after the pandemic is over?**\n\nOr do you really believe in a permanent WFH world? Do you really believe in a world where everybody is at home, downtown area is empty, offices are all vacant? There are success stories in battling Covid, like China or Singapore, where most people are back in office already. Also today **Pfizer just announced today its vaccine may be put in use as early as late November (**[https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-could-apply-for-emergency-use-of-covid-19-vaccine-by-late-november-11602842906](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-could-apply-for-emergency-use-of-covid-19-vaccine-by-late-november-11602842906)) But apparently, **market thinks this has no impact on Zoom at all**. It\u2019s true that some big tech firms can afford to have employees work permanently from home. But many of them do not use Zoom. Microsoft and Google both use inhouse tools (Team and Duo) and ban Zoom. Even if they WFH forever, does it benefit ZM? Moreover, **customers with fewer than 10 employees represent 36% of ZM\u2019s Q2 revenue** (Goldman Sachs research). Even if tech WFH forever, do you think teams smaller than 10 will too? **How does ZM retain this 36% of earnings?**\n\n# ZM, the next FSLY?\n\nOne last note on the numbers. **Before FSLY\u2019s 30% tumble, its price to sales ratio was 35. Nasdaq index\u2019s  average P/S ratio is 5.1. ZM today is at 54.59** (Bloomberg BEST\\_PX\\_SALES\\_RATIO). ZM is going to report Q3 earnings on Dec 6. It\u2019s estimated EPS is 0.753, a 736.32% YOY growth. If similar to FSLY, its revenue misses by 5.6%, do we expect a 31% drop too?\n\nHere\u2019s my question to my dear r/stocks friends. **When people finally realize the future is not that rosy for ZM.

In addition, Europe now accounts for about one-third of new cases reported worldwide ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/world/europe/europe-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage)). This has led to a flurry of new mitigation measures, including strict 9pm-6am curfew for Paris and eight other big French cities ([FT](https://www.ft.com/content/e3e6d790-c767-4d07-a158-cb2e8d5a5899)), and Londoners prohibited from mixing with other households beginning this weekend ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-15/london-households-will-be-banned-from-mixing-as-rules-tightened?sref=L75TRUmI)). However, countries are still trying to avoid the more draconian measures seen in the initial phase of the pandemic ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/europe-covid-restrictions-lockdown-second-wave-fbb4952a-632c-4b83-9e8d-c9ab5e2aff82.html)). In the US, new cases rose above 59K, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with several Midwestern states reporting elevated levels in recent days ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-latest-updates-10-15-2020-11602749198)). The seven-day average of 51,038 as of Tuesday was also the highest since mid-August, while hospitalizations were at the highest level since 28-Aug as of Wednesday.\n\n**Stimulus skepticism:**\n\n* Multiple reports in recent days have flagged the heightened skepticism surrounding the prospects for a bipartisan agreement on a fifth coronavirus relief package before the election. While the gap between the proposals from House Democrats ($2.2T) and White House ($1.8T) has narrowed to just \\~$400B, there continue to be myriad stumbling blocks. These include the level of enhanced unemployment benefits and additional state and local government funding (and how these funds would be dispersed), a strategic coronavirus plan, liability protections for businesses, healthcare aid and apportion tax credits. In addition, Senate Majority Leader McConnell said he would only put $500B package on the floor (Politico via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1316760383999410177)), despite prodding from Trump. House Speaker Pelosi said today stimulus relief won't wait until January, and Democrats would address needs if no deal is made, though didn't offer any detail on what that would look like, as Pelosi previously said Democrats will not support targeted measures.\n\n**Sector performance mixed with value groups ahead but FAANG complex a weight:**\n\n* **Energy** the leader, with E&amp;Ps and services among the best groups. Banks better in **financials** after latest round of reports. **REITs** ahead. **Industrials** beat the tape with help from trucking and rails. AMZN-US a bit lower in **consumer discretionary**, but retailers, restaurants, were homebuilders are mostly higher. **Consumer staples** saw some cushion from drug stores (particularly WBA-US on its beat). **Materials** an underperformer, with precious metals miners, aluminum (AA-US earnings) among the worst performers. **Tech** saw weakness in software and semis, while AAPL-US and were MSFT-US both down as well. **Communication services** trailed with the megacap internets lower (especially FB-US ). **Healthcare** the worst performer on pharma, biotech (particularly VRTX-US on update).\n\n**Initial jobless claims higher but drop in continuing; manufacturing surveys mostly better:**\n\n* Weekly **initial jobless claims** at 898K in the week ending 10-Oct, versus consensus of 825K and prior week's reading 845k (revised up 5k). Largest increases in FL, IL, MA; largest decreases in NJ, KS, PA. Four-week average was 866K, up 8K. **Continuing claims** for the week ending 3-Oct were well lower at 10.018M vs consensus 10.500M and prior week's 11.183M (revised up by 207K). Elsewhere, October **NY Fed Empire manufacturing** survey of 10.5 versus consensus 14 and last month's 17. New orders, shipments and employment indicators rose further into more positive territory, however expectations for general business and capex less positive. October **Philadelphia Fed manufacturing** index of 32.3 vs consensus and prior reading of 15. New orders, shipments and employee workweek grew faster while number of employees slowed a bit. Expectations strengthened.\n\n**Biden leads Trump by 11 points in latest national poll:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-has-11-point-lead-over-trump-less-than-three-weeks-to-election-day-11602734461?mod=hp_lead_pos2) said the latest WSJ/NBC News national poll has Joe Biden 11 points ahead of President Trump, down from a 14-point lead in the immediate aftermath of the debate, but still better than the 8-point lead in September. Comes ahead of the candidates' dueling town hall events tonight. According to [RealClear Politics average of recent polls](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/elections/trump-vs-biden-top-battleground-states/), Biden holds a 4.9-point lead over Trump in the top battleground states. Morgan Stanley recently said that with polls, betting markets, and polling-based models pointing to a sizable advantage for Biden in the presidential election, investors should focus much more on the Senate given the potential for a Democratic sweep to lead to meaningful fiscal stimulus. According to [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/senate/), Democrats are currently slight favorites to win the Senate.\n\n**Vaccine hesitancy remains elevated:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ahead-of-covid-19-vaccine-half-of-americans-indicate-reluctance-wsj-nbc-poll-finds-11602734460?mod=hp_lead_pos7) noted that WSJ/NBC News poll revealed that \\~70% of registered voters surveyed said they would take a coronavirus vaccine. However, only 20% said they would take a vaccine as soon as one becomes available, while about half said they wanted to wait until they learned more about the shot. Added that 17% said they would not take a vaccine at all and 10% said they would eventually take a vaccine, but only if it was mandatory. Pointed out that the 27% who said they would not want to get vaccinated compares to other polls that have found about a third of people surveyed opposed. Paper highlighted the importance of vaccinations in efforts to achieve herd immunity. Anti-vax momentum, an issue even before the pandemic, seemingly exacerbated by the politicization and speed of the current coronavirus vaccine push.\n\n**More income cliff concerns, more signs consumer spending is holding up:**\n\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/14/millions-workers-face-jobless-benefits-cliff-with-lifeline-set-to-expire-429532) discussed how the US is nearing a 31-Dec deadline when several key federal jobless programs established under the CARES Act in March will end completely. Noted that if Congress does not pass new stimulus legislation, more than half of those receiving unemployment benefits - \\~13.4M people - will be left with no income. Article said that economists and lawmakers have warned that should these programs be allowed to lapse, the resulting blow to states and workers could unleash a downward spiral. At the same time, the fiscal cliff concerns that dominated the headlines this summer never really seemed to come fruition.

In addition, Europe now accounts for about one-third of new cases reported worldwide ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/world/europe/europe-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage)). This has led to a flurry of new mitigation measures, including strict 9pm-6am curfew for Paris and eight other big French cities ([FT](https://www.ft.com/content/e3e6d790-c767-4d07-a158-cb2e8d5a5899)), and Londoners prohibited from mixing with other households beginning this weekend ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-15/london-households-will-be-banned-from-mixing-as-rules-tightened?sref=L75TRUmI)). However, countries are still trying to avoid the more draconian measures seen in the initial phase of the pandemic ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/europe-covid-restrictions-lockdown-second-wave-fbb4952a-632c-4b83-9e8d-c9ab5e2aff82.html)). In the US, new cases rose above 59K, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with several Midwestern states reporting elevated levels in recent days ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-latest-updates-10-15-2020-11602749198)). The seven-day average of 51,038 as of Tuesday was also the highest since mid-August, while hospitalizations were at the highest level since 28-Aug as of Wednesday.\n\n**Stimulus skepticism:**\n\n* Multiple reports in recent days have flagged the heightened skepticism surrounding the prospects for a bipartisan agreement on a fifth coronavirus relief package before the election. While the gap between the proposals from House Democrats ($2.2T) and White House ($1.8T) has narrowed to just \\~$400B, there continue to be myriad stumbling blocks. These include the level of enhanced unemployment benefits and additional state and local government funding (and how these funds would be dispersed), a strategic coronavirus plan, liability protections for businesses, healthcare aid and apportion tax credits. In addition, Senate Majority Leader McConnell said he would only put $500B package on the floor (Politico via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1316760383999410177)), despite prodding from Trump. House Speaker Pelosi said today stimulus relief won't wait until January, and Democrats would address needs if no deal is made, though didn't offer any detail on what that would look like, as Pelosi previously said Democrats will not support targeted measures.\n\n**Sector performance mixed with value groups ahead but FAANG complex a weight:**\n\n* **Energy** the leader, with E&amp;Ps and services among the best groups. Banks better in **financials** after latest round of reports. **REITs** ahead. **Industrials** beat the tape with help from trucking and rails. AMZN-US a bit lower in **consumer discretionary**, but retailers, restaurants, were homebuilders are mostly higher. **Consumer staples** saw some cushion from drug stores (particularly WBA-US on its beat). **Materials** an underperformer, with precious metals miners, aluminum (AA-US earnings) among the worst performers. **Tech** saw weakness in software and semis, while AAPL-US and were MSFT-US both down as well. **Communication services** trailed with the megacap internets lower (especially FB-US ). **Healthcare** the worst performer on pharma, biotech (particularly VRTX-US on update).\n\n**Initial jobless claims higher but drop in continuing; manufacturing surveys mostly better:**\n\n* Weekly **initial jobless claims** at 898K in the week ending 10-Oct, versus consensus of 825K and prior week's reading 845k (revised up 5k). Largest increases in FL, IL, MA; largest decreases in NJ, KS, PA. Four-week average was 866K, up 8K. **Continuing claims** for the week ending 3-Oct were well lower at 10.018M vs consensus 10.500M and prior week's 11.183M (revised up by 207K). Elsewhere, October **NY Fed Empire manufacturing** survey of 10.5 versus consensus 14 and last month's 17. New orders, shipments and employment indicators rose further into more positive territory, however expectations for general business and capex less positive. October **Philadelphia Fed manufacturing** index of 32.3 vs consensus and prior reading of 15. New orders, shipments and employee workweek grew faster while number of employees slowed a bit. Expectations strengthened.\n\n**Biden leads Trump by 11 points in latest national poll:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-has-11-point-lead-over-trump-less-than-three-weeks-to-election-day-11602734461?mod=hp_lead_pos2) said the latest WSJ/NBC News national poll has Joe Biden 11 points ahead of President Trump, down from a 14-point lead in the immediate aftermath of the debate, but still better than the 8-point lead in September. Comes ahead of the candidates' dueling town hall events tonight. According to [RealClear Politics average of recent polls](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/elections/trump-vs-biden-top-battleground-states/), Biden holds a 4.9-point lead over Trump in the top battleground states. Morgan Stanley recently said that with polls, betting markets, and polling-based models pointing to a sizable advantage for Biden in the presidential election, investors should focus much more on the Senate given the potential for a Democratic sweep to lead to meaningful fiscal stimulus. According to [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/senate/), Democrats are currently slight favorites to win the Senate.\n\n**Vaccine hesitancy remains elevated:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ahead-of-covid-19-vaccine-half-of-americans-indicate-reluctance-wsj-nbc-poll-finds-11602734460?mod=hp_lead_pos7) noted that WSJ/NBC News poll revealed that \\~70% of registered voters surveyed said they would take a coronavirus vaccine. However, only 20% said they would take a vaccine as soon as one becomes available, while about half said they wanted to wait until they learned more about the shot. Added that 17% said they would not take a vaccine at all and 10% said they would eventually take a vaccine, but only if it was mandatory. Pointed out that the 27% who said they would not want to get vaccinated compares to other polls that have found about a third of people surveyed opposed. Paper highlighted the importance of vaccinations in efforts to achieve herd immunity. Anti-vax momentum, an issue even before the pandemic, seemingly exacerbated by the politicization and speed of the current coronavirus vaccine push.\n\n**More income cliff concerns, more signs consumer spending is holding up:**\n\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/14/millions-workers-face-jobless-benefits-cliff-with-lifeline-set-to-expire-429532) discussed how the US is nearing a 31-Dec deadline when several key federal jobless programs established under the CARES Act in March will end completely. Noted that if Congress does not pass new stimulus legislation, more than half of those receiving unemployment benefits - \\~13.4M people - will be left with no income. Article said that economists and lawmakers have warned that should these programs be allowed to lapse, the resulting blow to states and workers could unleash a downward spiral. At the same time, the fiscal cliff concerns that dominated the headlines this summer never really seemed to come fruition. BofA said today that while aggregated credit and debit card data shows a slowdown in spending for the population that received unemployment insurance, overall consumer spending has continued to grow at a stable pace since mid-July.\n\n**Quarles says Fed may have to stay involved in Treasury market for a long time:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-14/the-treasury-market-may-be-so-big-that-the-fed-can-t-step-away?sref=L75TRUmI) cited comments from Fed Governor Quarles, who said that the Treasury market has become so large that the Fed may have to continue its asset purchases for a long time to help support market functioning.

Said he will stop negotiating until after the election, expecting that he will pass a major stimulus bill after he is reelected. Added Senate Majority Leader McConnell should focus on upcoming confirmation hearings for his SCOTUS nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. Abrupt end to stimulus talks comes after a weeks-long back and forth between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin that did not seem to be closing the gap between Democrats' offer and the White House's $1.6T. Pelosi criticized Trump's move, saying it shows the White House is in complete disarray. However, still a lot of focus on whether more stimulus could come in January in the event Democrats win the White House and control in the Senate.\n\n**Most sectors lower with big tech, energy the big underperformers:**\n\n* Pullback in FAANG names after a strong session Monday was a weight on **consumer discretionary**, **communication services**, and **tech**.

Airlines were a weight on **industrials**, but machinery was mixed. **Financials** saw credit cards down but regional banks were not so bad overall. **Consumer staples** saw some help from HPCs. **Utilities** was the only sector in the green.\n\n**Trump says will hit campaign trail soon, will participate in next week's debate:**\n\n* President Trump said today he would be back on the campaign trail soon, while his campaign said that he intends to be ready to participate in the second presidential debate scheduled for Thursday, 15-Oct in Miami ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/trump-looking-forward-to-second-debate-with-biden-after-covid-diagnosis.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain)). [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-06/trump-is-considering-televised-speech-after-return-from-hospital?srnd=premium) reported Trump wants to return to the Oval Office today, and while some aides don't want the president to leave the residence, they're unsure how long he'll continue to isolate himself. Elsewhere, General Milley, top US military official, among members of Joint Chiefs of Staff in self-quarantine after Coast Guard's vice commandant tested positive ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-06/military-s-chief-to-quarantine-after-an-admiral-tests-positive?srnd=premium&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B)). Comes after President Trump was discharged from Walter Reed Medical Center on Monday evening and returned to the White House, tweeted a video in which he said he was feeling better and urged Americans not to be afraid of the coronavirus. Trump's physician today said the president reported no symptoms after first night back at White House.\n\n**Powell cautiously optimistic, again makes case for further support:**\n\n* No big surprises from Fed Chair Powell's [keynote speech](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20201006a.htm) at the NABE annual conference today. Noted combination of fiscal and monetary actions have for now muted recessionary dynamics, but cautioned outlook remains highly uncertain due to the coronavirus. Warned about risk rapid reopening gains could transition to a longer-than-expected slog back, noting in particular increase in permanent job losses. Suggested risks of policy intervention are asymmetric, with too little leading to unnecessary hardship while relief that proves greater than needed will still not go to waste. His comments on monetary policy and forward guidance were tightly in line with recent Fed pronouncements and broke no new ground.\n\n**Biden 16 points ahead of Trump in new national poll:**\n\n* [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/politics/cnn-poll-biden-trump-2020-election/index.html) said that a new nationwide CNN Poll conducted by SSRS showed that Joe Biden's advantage over President Trump has widened to 16 points, his largest of the cycle. The prior survey at the beginning of September showed Biden with an 8-point lead. Report noted that similar to a recently released WSJ-NBC News poll, the CNN poll suggests Biden likely received a bump from the first presidential debate. However, it also pointed out that the poll does not show any meaningful pullback in support for Trump. It said Trump's core backers remain as supportive of him as they have been, if not more. It also stressed that the election will ultimately come down to a handful of swing stakes, where Biden has a narrower lead. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-battlegrounds-poll/reuters-ipsos-poll-shows-biden-leading-in-pennsylvania-wisconsin-idUSKBN26Q2ZT) said Reuters/Ipsos polls out on Monday showed Biden 5 points ahead of Trump in Pennsylvania and 6 points ahead in Wisconsin, while today's [Monmouth](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_pa_100620.pdf/) poll showed Biden holding a 12-point lead across registered voters in Pennsylvania.\n\n**White House agrees to FDA guidance for two-month vaccine followup:**\n\n* The US FDA today released expected [guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download) saying that data from phase 3 studies for coronavirus vaccine candidates should include two months of follow-up data in order to qualify for emergency use authorization (EUA), meaning it is most likely a vaccine will not be cleared for use until after the 3-Nov presidential election. Recall that the Trump administration had voiced objections to the FDA's likely guidance, with Trump himself saying the FDA needed to move quickly and hinting he \"may or may not\" approve such guidance, saying it seemed like a political move. However, the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-agrees-to-fdas-guidelines-for-vetting-covid-19-vaccines-11602011953) reported today that the White House has endorsed the guidelines. For its part, the FDA said it hoped the guidance will help the public understand that its practices help ensure quality, safety, and efficacy for any vaccine it authorizes.\n\n**Democrats on House panel to recommend measures that could make it easier to break up big tech platforms:**\n\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/05/gop-democrats-tech-antitrust-proposals-426528) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-05/house-panel-to-recommend-breakup-of-tech-giants-republican-says?srnd=premium&amp;sref=L75TRUmI) reported that Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee are poised to propose sweeping reforms that could make it easier to break up big tech platforms. However, these proposals have already been previewed by Representative David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat leading the investigation. He said back in August that his panel's inquiry confirmed Google (GOOGL-US ), Apple (AAPL-US ), Amazon (AMZN-US ) and Facebook (FB-US ) are abusing their market power to crush competitors and Congress needs to respond. Republican Representative Ken Buck of Colorado said that while he agrees with Cicilline on the need to rein in the power of big tech and provide more resources for antitrust enforcers, the more aggressive proposals like legislation creating structural separation are \"non-starters\" for Republicans. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/scoop-house-dems-briefing-biden-team-on-tech-antitrust-report-843b1d7d-fbc1-43b4-b425-96bcc872bd93.html) also reported House Judiciary Democrats to brief Biden's team today.\n\n**Central banks focused on need for fiscal stimulus but face decisions on QE:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-cenbanks/mid-recovery-coronavirus-spreading-global-central-bankers-take-stock-idUSKBN26R0JS) discussed how leading central bankers are expected to continue to stress the need for additional fiscal policy support to cushion the global economy from the coronavirus pandemic. However, it also pointed out that the Fed, ECB and BOJ all face decisions in the coming weeks over their next crisis-fighting measures, particularly when it comes to the question of whether and how to expand the amounts and types of assets they are buying each month. One of the disappointments coming out of the September FOMC meeting was that while the Fed tweaked the QE rationale to include helping to foster accommodative financial conditions, it did not adjust the size or composition of the asset purchase program. The Fed's Mester said on Monday she does not see a current need for more bond buying (Fed's Evans was also cautious last week) but wants the option to extend duration.", false, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 868043, "public", "self", "Top Stories - Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2020", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j6chyx/top_stories_tuesday_oct_6_2020/", "all_ads", 6, 1602011270.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "spacej3di", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_kdm2ull", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1602014870, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j6chyx/top_stories_tuesday_oct_6_2020/", "gildings": {}, "id": "j6chyx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "resources", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "a376614c-65e6-11e5-b6e7-123c7cc7e97b", "link_flair_text": "Resources", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/j6chyx/top_stories_tuesday_oct_6_2020/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Ptp7NpWYrlVad3rOJ1SZRbeyyLhs1-ReJ7rOaKgyQrs", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kNn-VUL_WDT2fli5KjAY1_sfQ9UUFDD-62N_yt6iQ-4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c031fb0494affe012dc3651121742690d35a49ab", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kNn-VUL_WDT2fli5KjAY1_sfQ9UUFDD-62N_yt6iQ-4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e7d9e9531981df6a1bbee0deff47372d0633251", "width": 216}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kNn-VUL_WDT2fli5KjAY1_sfQ9UUFDD-62N_yt6iQ-4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=127b51ab3933b005daa4bf19ca1b5099f828bfd1", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 400, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kNn-VUL_WDT2fli5KjAY1_sfQ9UUFDD-62N_yt6iQ-4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d6d70346b02c13e65b977992ffa9f82e4af5d161", "width": 400}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1602014880, "score": 1, "selftext": "Summarized to save you time.\n\n**Trump says he is done negotiating with Democrats over stimulus:**\n\n* President Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1313551794623127552) he has rejected House Speaker Pelosi's $2.4T proposal for a fifth round of coronavirus stimulus, suggesting much of the amount would be used to bail out Democratic-run states.

His comments on monetary policy and forward guidance were tightly in line with recent Fed pronouncements and broke no new ground.\n\n**Biden 16 points ahead of Trump in new national poll:**\n\n* [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/politics/cnn-poll-biden-trump-2020-election/index.html) said that a new nationwide CNN Poll conducted by SSRS showed that Joe Biden's advantage over President Trump has widened to 16 points, his largest of the cycle. The prior survey at the beginning of September showed Biden with an 8-point lead. Report noted that similar to a recently released WSJ-NBC News poll, the CNN poll suggests Biden likely received a bump from the first presidential debate. However, it also pointed out that the poll does not show any meaningful pullback in support for Trump. It said Trump's core backers remain as supportive of him as they have been, if not more. It also stressed that the election will ultimately come down to a handful of swing stakes, where Biden has a narrower lead. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-battlegrounds-poll/reuters-ipsos-poll-shows-biden-leading-in-pennsylvania-wisconsin-idUSKBN26Q2ZT) said Reuters/Ipsos polls out on Monday showed Biden 5 points ahead of Trump in Pennsylvania and 6 points ahead in Wisconsin, while today's [Monmouth](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_pa_100620.pdf/) poll showed Biden holding a 12-point lead across registered voters in Pennsylvania.\n\n**White House agrees to FDA guidance for two-month vaccine followup:**\n\n* The US FDA today released expected [guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download) saying that data from phase 3 studies for coronavirus vaccine candidates should include two months of follow-up data in order to qualify for emergency use authorization (EUA), meaning it is most likely a vaccine will not be cleared for use until after the 3-Nov presidential election. Recall that the Trump administration had voiced objections to the FDA's likely guidance, with Trump himself saying the FDA needed to move quickly and hinting he \"may or may not\" approve such guidance, saying it seemed like a political move. However, the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-agrees-to-fdas-guidelines-for-vetting-covid-19-vaccines-11602011953) reported today that the White House has endorsed the guidelines. For its part, the FDA said it hoped the guidance will help the public understand that its practices help ensure quality, safety, and efficacy for any vaccine it authorizes.\n\n**Democrats on House panel to recommend measures that could make it easier to break up big tech platforms:**\n\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/05/gop-democrats-tech-antitrust-proposals-426528) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-05/house-panel-to-recommend-breakup-of-tech-giants-republican-says?srnd=premium&amp;sref=L75TRUmI) reported that Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee are poised to propose sweeping reforms that could make it easier to break up big tech platforms. However, these proposals have already been previewed by Representative David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat leading the investigation. He said back in August that his panel's inquiry confirmed Google (GOOGL-US ), Apple (AAPL-US ), Amazon (AMZN-US ) and Facebook (FB-US ) are abusing their market power to crush competitors and Congress needs to respond. Republican Representative Ken Buck of Colorado said that while he agrees with Cicilline on the need to rein in the power of big tech and provide more resources for antitrust enforcers, the more aggressive proposals like legislation creating structural separation are \"non-starters\" for Republicans. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/scoop-house-dems-briefing-biden-team-on-tech-antitrust-report-843b1d7d-fbc1-43b4-b425-96bcc872bd93.html) also reported House Judiciary Democrats to brief Biden's team today.\n\n**Central banks focused on need for fiscal stimulus but face decisions on QE:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-cenbanks/mid-recovery-coronavirus-spreading-global-central-bankers-take-stock-idUSKBN26R0JS) discussed how leading central bankers are expected to continue to stress the need for additional fiscal policy support to cushion the global economy from the coronavirus pandemic. However, it also pointed out that the Fed, ECB and BOJ all face decisions in the coming weeks over their next crisis-fighting measures, particularly when it comes to the question of whether and how to expand the amounts and types of assets they are buying each month. One of the disappointments coming out of the September FOMC meeting was that while the Fed tweaked the QE rationale to include helping to foster accommodative financial conditions, it did not adjust the size or composition of the asset purchase program. The Fed's Mester said on Monday she does not see a current need for more bond buying (Fed's Evans was also cautious last week) but wants the option to extend duration.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 868043, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Top Stories - Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2020", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j6chyx/top_stories_tuesday_oct_6_2020/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1602011270.0}], [[], false, "Smart-Weird", null, [], null, "text", "t2_5ifseipu", false, false, [], false, false, 1602008346, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j6ad5k/what_to_do_with_rsu/", {}, "j6ad5k", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "advicerequest", [], "75a227ec-65e6-11e5-96ee-12d48f46797b", "Advice Request", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 4, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/j6ad5k/what_to_do_with_rsu/", false, 6, 1602008357, 1, "I was given bunch of stocks as vested RSU\nFinal numbers (as of today\u2019s market) ~ 400 stock units.\nThe company is a stable tech company, and probably little overvalued ( think one of FB/G/AAPL/MSFT/NFLX/AMZN stock).\nWhat should I do.\nSell at current value as even after tax it\u2019s a good money ?\nOr Keep as is hoping it would even get better ?", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 867927, "public", "self", "What To Do With RSU", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j6ad5k/what_to_do_with_rsu/", "all_ads", 6, 1602004746.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Smart-Weird", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5ifseipu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1602008346, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j6ad5k/what_to_do_with_rsu/", "gildings": {}, "id": "j6ad5k", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "advicerequest", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "75a227ec-65e6-11e5-96ee-12d48f46797b", "link_flair_text": "Advice Request", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/j6ad5k/what_to_do_with_rsu/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1602008357, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was given bunch of stocks as vested RSU\nFinal numbers (as of today\u2019s market) ~ 400 stock units.\nThe company is a stable tech company, and probably little overvalued ( think one of FB/G/AAPL/MSFT/NFLX/AMZN stock).\nWhat should I do.\nSell at current value as even after tax it\u2019s a good money ?\nOr Keep as is hoping it would even get better ?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 867927, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What To Do With RSU", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j6ad5k/what_to_do_with_rsu/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1602004746.0}], [[], false, "spacej3di", null, [], null, "text", "t2_kdm2ull", false, false, [], false, false, 1601994193, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j65xay/morning_market_synopsis_tuesday_oct_6_2020/", {}, "j65xay", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "resources", [], "a376614c-65e6-11e5-b6e7-123c7cc7e97b", "Resources", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 0, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/j65xay/morning_market_synopsis_tuesday_oct_6_2020/", false, 6, 1601994204, 1, " **US equities higher: Dow +0.47%, S&amp;P 500 +0.20%, Nasdaq +0.14%, Russell 2000 +0.87%**\n\n* US equities higher in Tuesday morning trading, near best levels.

Latest polling shows Biden widening lead against Trump both nationally and in battleground states, lowering risk of a contested election ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-05/a-clear-cut-biden-win-is-emerging-as-a-bull-case-for-stocks?sref=J9GPLx1B)). Rising odds of fiscal stimulus with Dem sweep were also increasingly in focus. Economists from Goldman Sachs upgraded their US forecasts on a higher probability of a stimulus of at least $2T shortly after 20-Jan inauguration. There was also optimism from White House over agreement on stimulus as soon as this week (though bipartisan deal still faces a number of headwinds). Rates were also higher with curve steepening on some of today's election themes given potential impact of borrowing, inflationary pressure around massive stimulus. JPMorgan strategists also downplayed potential tax increases, arguing they'd be watered down given current economic conditions. Other ongoing tailwinds included monetary policy, vaccine optimism, resilient corporate profits.\n\n**All sectors finish higher, with energy, tech, healthcare the leaders:**\n\n* **Energy** led the market amid big WTI gains with refiners, services among best groups. **Tech** beat the tape on gains across semis, hardware. **Healthcare** was an outperformer with biotech getting a boost from M&amp;A tailwind, while managed care also extending recent gains on lower perceived threat from a Biden administration. **Materials** was ahead on strength in industrial metals, chemicals (lithium names in particular). **Industrials** was a slight underperformer with machinery, trucking better but some weakness in airlines. **Communications services** stocks were broadly higher, but telecom performance was more moderate. Homebuilders, restaurants were among the drags on **consumer discretionary**. **Financials** saw some outperformance by banks, but some softness in exchanges, online brokers. **Consumer staples** saw scattered decliners in beverages, HPCs. **REITs** trailed the market.\n\n**Trump leaving hospital this evening:**\n\n* President Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313186529058136070) he will leave Walter Reed Medical Center today. Members of his medical team said Trump has been fever-free for 72 hours, has been ambulating, and has no respiratory complaints. Added while he may not be entirely out of the woods, the team agrees that his clinical status supports returning home to the White House. Said discussions had taken place about precautions for the president to follow as he does his work. Trump has been treated with Gilead's (GILD-US ) remdesivir and will receive a final dose tomorrow at the White House. Also received a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies by Regeneron (REGN-US ) and the steroid dexamethasone, which is typically used for the sickest COVID-19 patients.\n\n**Trump calls for swift action on stimulus, Pelosi says progress being made:**\n\n* President Trump on Saturday urged Congress to move swiftly on fiscal stimulus. [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/10/03/trump-coronavirus-stimulus-package/) noted White House officials have privately expressed confidence the outlines of a deal could come to fruition by the middle of the week. House Speaker Pelosi said on Sunday that lawmakers \"making progress\" but flagged significant disagreement in key areas such as unemployment, schools, and state and local funding, the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, testing and tracing, and appropriations. Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin reported to have spoken for an hour today and will exchange proposals in advance of another phone call tomorrow ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress-idUSKBN26Q1EG?taid=5f7b76d32e33a1000143489a&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter)).

Rising odds of fiscal stimulus with Dem sweep were also increasingly in focus. Economists from Goldman Sachs upgraded their US forecasts on a higher probability of a stimulus of at least $2T shortly after 20-Jan inauguration. There was also optimism from White House over agreement on stimulus as soon as this week (though bipartisan deal still faces a number of headwinds). Rates were also higher with curve steepening on some of today's election themes given potential impact of borrowing, inflationary pressure around massive stimulus. JPMorgan strategists also downplayed potential tax increases, arguing they'd be watered down given current economic conditions. Other ongoing tailwinds included monetary policy, vaccine optimism, resilient corporate profits.\n\n**All sectors finish higher, with energy, tech, healthcare the leaders:**\n\n* **Energy** led the market amid big WTI gains with refiners, services among best groups. **Tech** beat the tape on gains across semis, hardware. **Healthcare** was an outperformer with biotech getting a boost from M&amp;A tailwind, while managed care also extending recent gains on lower perceived threat from a Biden administration. **Materials** was ahead on strength in industrial metals, chemicals (lithium names in particular). **Industrials** was a slight underperformer with machinery, trucking better but some weakness in airlines. **Communications services** stocks were broadly higher, but telecom performance was more moderate. Homebuilders, restaurants were among the drags on **consumer discretionary**. **Financials** saw some outperformance by banks, but some softness in exchanges, online brokers. **Consumer staples** saw scattered decliners in beverages, HPCs. **REITs** trailed the market.\n\n**Trump leaving hospital this evening:**\n\n* President Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313186529058136070) he will leave Walter Reed Medical Center today. Members of his medical team said Trump has been fever-free for 72 hours, has been ambulating, and has no respiratory complaints. Added while he may not be entirely out of the woods, the team agrees that his clinical status supports returning home to the White House. Said discussions had taken place about precautions for the president to follow as he does his work. Trump has been treated with Gilead's (GILD-US ) remdesivir and will receive a final dose tomorrow at the White House. Also received a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies by Regeneron (REGN-US ) and the steroid dexamethasone, which is typically used for the sickest COVID-19 patients.\n\n**Trump calls for swift action on stimulus, Pelosi says progress being made:**\n\n* President Trump on Saturday urged Congress to move swiftly on fiscal stimulus.

I\u2019m moving there in February of next year.\n\nSo should options be a part of my portfolio or would I be fine just contributing into ETFS/individual stocks and getting my return that way. \n\n\nHere is my stock list I want to invest in through the year. \n\nAPPL\nINTC\nCOST\nTSLA\nJNJ\nSQ\nWMT\nBA\nBABA\nSPY\nATVI\nEEM\nVXUS\nIWM\nQQQ\nVOO\nVTI\nARKK\nUBER\nMCD\nSBUX \nDNKN\nNFLX\nAMD\nNVDA\nPPL\nAMZN\nFB\n\nThank you!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 867065, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do I need options in my portfolio?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j5q307/do_i_need_options_in_my_portfolio/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1601922566.0}], [[], false, "TeamWiped69", null, [], null, "text", "t2_5nkzcjpf", false, false, [], false, false, 1601921622, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j5omm0/qqq_what_happens_if_these_companies_are_forced_to/", {}, "j5omm0", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 3, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/j5omm0/qqq_what_happens_if_these_companies_are_forced_to/", false, 6, 1601921633, 1, "What do we think will happen to the NASDAQ-100 if some of these majority weighted companies are forced to spin off in at least two other moving parts?

This is up from an original proposal of $1T though Mnuchin has previously expressed a willingness to go up to $1.5T.

Recent layoff announcements have come from Disney (DIS-US ), Goldman Sachs (GS-US ), Allstate (ALL-US ), Marathon Petroleum (MPC-US ), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS-GB ), Elanco (ELAN-US ), and the airlines. The article highlighted concerns that job losses have begun to spill over the from the service sector that initially suffered the brunt of the layoffs from the coronavirus pandemic with more companies now looking to protect margins. Cost-cutting has been a key component of the earnings resilience theme. Back in late August, a [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-covid-19-layoffs-make-job-reductions-permanent-11598654257) article flagged concerns that a wave of corporate layoffs could be permanent as companies increasingly see the coronavirus pandemic as the driver of a more protracted economic downturn\n\n**Auto sector remains a recovery bright spot:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autos-sales/u-s-auto-sales-stay-on-recovery-path-despite-tight-inventory-idUSKBN26M4XB) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-01/fiat-chrysler-toyota-beat-3q-forecasts-auto-sales-update?sref=L75TRUmI) both discussed the recovery in the auto market over the course of Q3. General Motors (GM-US ), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU-US ) and Toyota (TM-US ) all reported better than expected results. GM also mentioned that sales improved sequentially each month within Q3 and that both industry and GM sales rebounded significantly in October, finishing the month with y/y sales increases. The articles highlighted strong consumer demand for SUVs, trucks and hybrids. These groups were longstanding outperformers before the coronavirus pandemic as well. Demand underpinned by a combination of broader economic recovery and low rates. A number of other companies with leverage to autos have also highlighted the sector recovery in their recent updates. These include dealers, semis and electronics.\n\n**Fed extends dividend and buyback restrictions on banks:**\n\n* Fed [announced ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200930b.htm)Wednesday after the close that none of the 33 banks with more than $100B of assets would be allowed to resume share repurchases in Q4 and that it would also maintain a cap on dividend payments. Fed said move intended to ensure the banks maintain a high level of capital resilience. Added that the capital positions of the big banks have remained strong during Q3 while such restrictions were in place. Move was widely expected by the Street. A number of banks that presented at the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference last month expressed an interest in resuming buyback activity as soon as possible. Capital return uncertainty has been an overhang on the group. The other big headwind has been lower NII guidance from softer loan demand and an uptick in repayments. However, banks have been more upbeat on asset quality.\n\n**Senate panel votes to subpoena tech executives:**\n\n* [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/519101-senate-panel-votes-to-subpoena-big-tech-executives) noted that the Senate Commerce Committee voted Thursday to subpoena the CEOs of Twitter (TWTR-US ), Google (GOOGL-US ) and Facebook (FB-US ). The vote compels the CEOs to testify at a hearing on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that will discuss social media's alleged conservative bias. The move was previewed last week. DOJ has already recommended that Congress pare back Section 230 laws, which give sites broad immunity from lawsuits for words, images, and videos. Back in May, President Trump signed an executive order to limit protections for online platforms. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/congress-looks-to-squeeze-big-tech-ahead-of-election-8deb407a-8e2a-4989-9682-dade915583a8.html) recently discussed how it's nearly certain that neither a Section 230 reform bill from the Senate nor the antitrust legislation that could come out of the House will pass anytime soon. Market has also tended to ignore the continued pickup in regulatory scrutiny in favor of secular growth and disruption themes.\n\n**Mixed vaccine headlines:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-30/oxford-astra-covid-vaccine-review-said-to-start-in-europe?srnd=premium-asia&amp;sref=L75TRUmI) reported European regulators set to announce an accelerated review of the coronavirus candidate from AstraZeneca (AZN-US ) and the University of Oxford. This will allow them to see trial data while the study is ongoing and potentially speed up the approval process. However, [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-vaccine-astrazenec/exclusive-fda-widens-u-s-safety-inquiry-into-astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-sources-idUKKBN26L3T8) reported the FDA has broadened its investigation of a serious illness in the AstraZeneca trial and will look at data from earlier trials developed by the same scientists. Noted this raises likelihood of further delays for what has been one of the most advanced vaccine candidates. CEO of Moderna (MRNA-US ) told the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/9b242ecc-3dce-4534-9171-cdf624468a2a) that his company would not be able to apply to the FDA for emergency use authorization of its coronavirus vaccine until at least late November.

Back in late August, a [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-covid-19-layoffs-make-job-reductions-permanent-11598654257) article flagged concerns that a wave of corporate layoffs could be permanent as companies increasingly see the coronavirus pandemic as the driver of a more protracted economic downturn\n\n**Auto sector remains a recovery bright spot:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autos-sales/u-s-auto-sales-stay-on-recovery-path-despite-tight-inventory-idUSKBN26M4XB) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-01/fiat-chrysler-toyota-beat-3q-forecasts-auto-sales-update?sref=L75TRUmI) both discussed the recovery in the auto market over the course of Q3. General Motors (GM-US ), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU-US ) and Toyota (TM-US ) all reported better than expected results. GM also mentioned that sales improved sequentially each month within Q3 and that both industry and GM sales rebounded significantly in October, finishing the month with y/y sales increases. The articles highlighted strong consumer demand for SUVs, trucks and hybrids. These groups were longstanding outperformers before the coronavirus pandemic as well. Demand underpinned by a combination of broader economic recovery and low rates. A number of other companies with leverage to autos have also highlighted the sector recovery in their recent updates. These include dealers, semis and electronics.\n\n**Fed extends dividend and buyback restrictions on banks:**\n\n* Fed [announced ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200930b.htm)Wednesday after the close that none of the 33 banks with more than $100B of assets would be allowed to resume share repurchases in Q4 and that it would also maintain a cap on dividend payments. Fed said move intended to ensure the banks maintain a high level of capital resilience. Added that the capital positions of the big banks have remained strong during Q3 while such restrictions were in place. Move was widely expected by the Street. A number of banks that presented at the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference last month expressed an interest in resuming buyback activity as soon as possible. Capital return uncertainty has been an overhang on the group. The other big headwind has been lower NII guidance from softer loan demand and an uptick in repayments. However, banks have been more upbeat on asset quality.\n\n**Senate panel votes to subpoena tech executives:**\n\n* [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/519101-senate-panel-votes-to-subpoena-big-tech-executives) noted that the Senate Commerce Committee voted Thursday to subpoena the CEOs of Twitter (TWTR-US ), Google (GOOGL-US ) and Facebook (FB-US ). The vote compels the CEOs to testify at a hearing on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that will discuss social media's alleged conservative bias. The move was previewed last week. DOJ has already recommended that Congress pare back Section 230 laws, which give sites broad immunity from lawsuits for words, images, and videos. Back in May, President Trump signed an executive order to limit protections for online platforms. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/congress-looks-to-squeeze-big-tech-ahead-of-election-8deb407a-8e2a-4989-9682-dade915583a8.html) recently discussed how it's nearly certain that neither a Section 230 reform bill from the Senate nor the antitrust legislation that could come out of the House will pass anytime soon. Market has also tended to ignore the continued pickup in regulatory scrutiny in favor of secular growth and disruption themes.\n\n**Mixed vaccine headlines:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-30/oxford-astra-covid-vaccine-review-said-to-start-in-europe?srnd=premium-asia&amp;sref=L75TRUmI) reported European regulators set to announce an accelerated review of the coronavirus candidate from AstraZeneca (AZN-US ) and the University of Oxford. This will allow them to see trial data while the study is ongoing and potentially speed up the approval process. However, [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-vaccine-astrazenec/exclusive-fda-widens-u-s-safety-inquiry-into-astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-sources-idUKKBN26L3T8) reported the FDA has broadened its investigation of a serious illness in the AstraZeneca trial and will look at data from earlier trials developed by the same scientists. Noted this raises likelihood of further delays for what has been one of the most advanced vaccine candidates. CEO of Moderna (MRNA-US ) told the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/9b242ecc-3dce-4534-9171-cdf624468a2a) that his company would not be able to apply to the FDA for emergency use authorization of its coronavirus vaccine until at least late November. Added that he did not expect to have full approval for broad distribution until next spring.

Powell underscored the limitations of the Federal Reserve\u2019s lending powers. He said, \u201cMany borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy. But for others, a loan that could be difficult to repay might not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.\u201d Mnuchin added that he wanted to reauthorize measures under the Payment Protection Program (PPP) that offered forgivable loans to businesses that stayed open and kept most of their employees on payroll. Unfortunately, any reauthorization or reallocation of funds requires Congressional approval, something unlikely to happen with lawmakers unable to come to a consensus about stimulus and focused mainly on the Supreme Court.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Yesterday was Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) battery day.

In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.\u201d Mnuchin added that he wanted to reauthorize measures under the Payment Protection Program (PPP) that offered forgivable loans to businesses that stayed open and kept most of their employees on payroll. Unfortunately, any reauthorization or reallocation of funds requires Congressional approval, something unlikely to happen with lawmakers unable to come to a consensus about stimulus and focused mainly on the Supreme Court.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Yesterday was Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) battery day. The company laid out plans to $25,000 car and cut battery costs in half over the next three years.

The company, which has previously discussed the late-September timeline, is looking to enroll up to 60K people internationally. Its vaccine, the fourth to enter late-stage trials in the US, is the first that aims to protect people with a single shot.

Department also reportedly investigated control over online ad ecosystem, but decided to focus area that could best withstand a potential challenge in court. However, an investigation by a group of state attorneys general, led by Texas, is expected to result in a lawsuit accusing Google of undermining competition in the market for online advertising. Elsewhere, [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/doj-to-seek-congressional-curbs-on-immunity-for-internet-companies-11600862403) reported DoJ also submitted proposal to Congress to curb legal protections for internet companies such as FB-US , TWTR-US , and Google. While there has been a meaningful ramp in antitrust scrutiny surrounding big tech, it seems to have been largely overshadowed by the secular growth and secular disruption themes that have been further accelerated by the pandemic.\n\n**FDA to announce stricter standards for emergency use authorization of coronavirus vaccine:**\n\n* [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/09/22/fda-covid-vaccine-approval-standard/) reported FDA expected to outline stricter standards for an emergency use authorization (EUA) of a coronavirus vaccine as soon as this week. Paper said the move, which is intended to boost transparency and public trust, will make it exceedingly difficult for any vaccine to be cleared before Election Day. Noted public health experts are concerned that President Trump's repeated predictions of a vaccine before the election, along with the White House's interference in federal science agencies, could make an already reluctant public ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/axios-ipsos-poll-coronavirus-index-vaccine-doubts-e9205f29-8c18-4980-b920-a25b81eebd84.html)) even more cautious. Public health officials have repeatedly discussed the possibility that emergency use authorization could be granted before Phase 3 trials are complete though even if just about everything goes right, vaccine not expected to be widely distributed until late spring or summer of next year.\n\n**Busy day of Fedspeak, though nothing that is breaking new ground:**\n\n* Today seeing a welter of Fed speakers, though thus far there has been little that is incremental. Chair **Powell's** appearance before a House subcommittee was very similar to his appearance yesterday, with Powell defending the Main Street program but talking up the possible benefits of more PPP-style assistance. Elsewhere, Vice Chair **Clarida** reiterated inflation needs to be on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time to lift rates ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-23/clarida-says-fed-won-t-consider-rate-hike-until-2-inflation-met?utm_content=economics&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-economics)). Vice Chair **Quarles** [said ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20200923a.htm)minor inflationary overshoots are not a first-order concern for him. Chicago Fed's **Evans** (nonvoter) told MNI that \\~2.5% inflation for some time is possible if the Fed does its job right. Boston Fed President **Rosengren** (nonvoter) [outlined ](https://www.bostonfed.org/-/media/Documents/Speeches/PDF/20200923-text.pdf)a slightly more pessimistic economic forecast than his peers, adding that more fiscal support is needed but seeming increasingly unlikely to materialize. He also said the Fed would be lucky to get 2% inflation in four years.\n\n**Tesla outlines plan to more than halve battery costs, produce $25K vehicle:**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA-US ) said at its highly anticipated Battery Day on Tuesday that it plans to improve its battery range by 54%, while cutting cost/KWh by 56% and investment per GWh by 69%. It noted that the plan, which it expects will take three years to be fully implemented, will revolve around cell design, cell factory, anode materials, cathode materials and cell vehicle integration. Enhanced vertical integration is crucial to the company's goal of building a $25K electric vehicle by 2023 that is also fully autonomous, as well as its longer-term plan to produce 20M cars a year. Sell-side takeaways were fairly positive though the event did not seem to meaningfully alter the already widely understood technology/disruption narrative. Analysts also discussed the very elevated expectations surrounding the event, execution and operational challenges, investment requirements and premium valuation.\n\n**Health experts worried about an autumn surge in coronavirus cases:**\n\n* [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-states-cases-increase/2020/09/22/105826b4-f9ef-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html) said progress in slowing the coronavirus has stalled in much of the US, exacerbating concerns about a surge in cases as colder weather settles across the nation. Pointed out that 27 states and Puerto Rico have shown an increase in the seven-day average of new confirmed cases since the final week of August. Also discussed how countries that had been successful early on in dampening viral transmission are now struggling with new waves of cases and instituting new lockdowns. While the resurgence in Europe has been flagged as one of several overhangs on stocks over the last few weeks, the market has long tended to overlook rising case counts in favor of better treatment methods, an unwillingness to revert to the more draconian mitigation measures and most importantly, expectations of a near-term vaccine breakthrough.\n\n**Biden could end up being tougher on China than Trump:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/world/asia/biden-china-election-trump.html) noted that according to analysts in China, Joe Biden could end up being tougher on China than President Trump if he wins in November. Noted Biden has already promised to take a harder line on climate change and China's crackdowns on ethnic minorities and Hong Kong. In addition, unlike Trump, Biden expected to pursue a multilateral approach with America's allies to push back against China's global ambitions. However, article pointed out that many Chinese officials have come around to the view that China will likely face a harsher political environment in the US, regardless of who wins in November. Biden has already said he would not keep tariffs on China ([NPR](https://twitter.com/lourdesgnavarro/status/1291001056630112262)) and some Wall Street strategists have suggested that a less hawkish approach on trade could offset some of the market concerns surrounding his push for higher corporate taxes.\n\n01:08:07 PM CDT on 23 Sep '20", false, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 856747, "public", "self", "Top Stories - Wednesday, Sept. 23, 2020", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iyfnqh/top_stories_wednesday_sept_23_2020/", "all_ads", 6, 1600881401.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "spacej3di", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_kdm2ull", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1600885001, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iyfnqh/top_stories_wednesday_sept_23_2020/", "gildings": {}, "id": "iyfnqh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "news", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "866eb162-65e6-11e5-a903-1252b640afe9", "link_flair_text": "News", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/iyfnqh/top_stories_wednesday_sept_23_2020/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "tlPm4xNbjmq5Dzn6OqBFQFHWv2s5UKYHDFJqKqErhCg", "resolutions": [{"height": 71, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TPyRxKzTueAc9ew3F90o0SZQFOgE_4sUUBqOkQD-pmE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3952f1e497ce375af6dd02a8fe9a7833901807fa", "width": 108}, {"height": 143, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TPyRxKzTueAc9ew3F90o0SZQFOgE_4sUUBqOkQD-pmE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70a45ae0f103f6260646b0dd34255739b1e79774", "width": 216}, {"height": 213, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TPyRxKzTueAc9ew3F90o0SZQFOgE_4sUUBqOkQD-pmE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c78fbd2860c94ca2f95303bd6d05263419c3d5bf", "width": 320}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TPyRxKzTueAc9ew3F90o0SZQFOgE_4sUUBqOkQD-pmE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60819cc3e934c9aa51e4881a22c4dfc1a3708ebe", "width": 640}, {"height": 639, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TPyRxKzTueAc9ew3F90o0SZQFOgE_4sUUBqOkQD-pmE.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02f84786339a2b15974512de7de99a2bde5cd1c5", "width": 960}, {"height": 719, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TPyRxKzTueAc9ew3F90o0SZQFOgE_4sUUBqOkQD-pmE.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b71a2267a7e596ff6d36888b5319f03237dc9ff2", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 773, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TPyRxKzTueAc9ew3F90o0SZQFOgE_4sUUBqOkQD-pmE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=764431fa854710c03e619481bbc9c967782d6ef6", "width": 1160}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1600885012, "score": 1, "selftext": " **Growth groups reversing some of yesterday's gains, pulling market lower:**\n\n* **Energy**, the worst sector on the week, the biggest underperformer with integrated oil, services particularly weak. **Tech** and **communication services** also underperformers with most FAANGs and other large-cap tech names reversing some of yesterday's gains. **Materials** weighed down by precious metals miners, while TSLA-US battery updates a drag on some lithium names. **Consumer staples** a relative outperformer with cosmetics, discount retail better, but food mostly lower. **Consumer discretionary** ahead of the tape with NKE-US earnings providing support across apparel, while quick-serve restaurants, travel and leisure also better. **Financials** a bit higher with regional banks better, while insurers, funds, online brokers also among better groups. **Healthcare** ahead on pharmaceutical upside, notably JNJ-US on vaccine update. **Industrials** the best performer with construction and engineering, transports among the best performers.\n\n**House Democrats and White House reach deal on a stopgap measure to avoid a government shutdown:**\n\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/22/cr-vote-in-flux-419930) noted House on Tuesday overwhelmingly voted to extend federal funding through 11-Dec to avoid a pre-election government shutdown.

Elsewhere, Vice Chair **Clarida** reiterated inflation needs to be on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time to lift rates ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-23/clarida-says-fed-won-t-consider-rate-hike-until-2-inflation-met?utm_content=economics&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-economics)). Vice Chair **Quarles** [said ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20200923a.htm)minor inflationary overshoots are not a first-order concern for him. Chicago Fed's **Evans** (nonvoter) told MNI that \\~2.5% inflation for some time is possible if the Fed does its job right. Boston Fed President **Rosengren** (nonvoter) [outlined ](https://www.bostonfed.org/-/media/Documents/Speeches/PDF/20200923-text.pdf)a slightly more pessimistic economic forecast than his peers, adding that more fiscal support is needed but seeming increasingly unlikely to materialize. He also said the Fed would be lucky to get 2% inflation in four years.\n\n**Tesla outlines plan to more than halve battery costs, produce $25K vehicle:**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA-US ) said at its highly anticipated Battery Day on Tuesday that it plans to improve its battery range by 54%, while cutting cost/KWh by 56% and investment per GWh by 69%. It noted that the plan, which it expects will take three years to be fully implemented, will revolve around cell design, cell factory, anode materials, cathode materials and cell vehicle integration. Enhanced vertical integration is crucial to the company's goal of building a $25K electric vehicle by 2023 that is also fully autonomous, as well as its longer-term plan to produce 20M cars a year. Sell-side takeaways were fairly positive though the event did not seem to meaningfully alter the already widely understood technology/disruption narrative. Analysts also discussed the very elevated expectations surrounding the event, execution and operational challenges, investment requirements and premium valuation.\n\n**Health experts worried about an autumn surge in coronavirus cases:**\n\n* [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-states-cases-increase/2020/09/22/105826b4-f9ef-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html) said progress in slowing the coronavirus has stalled in much of the US, exacerbating concerns about a surge in cases as colder weather settles across the nation. Pointed out that 27 states and Puerto Rico have shown an increase in the seven-day average of new confirmed cases since the final week of August. Also discussed how countries that had been successful early on in dampening viral transmission are now struggling with new waves of cases and instituting new lockdowns. While the resurgence in Europe has been flagged as one of several overhangs on stocks over the last few weeks, the market has long tended to overlook rising case counts in favor of better treatment methods, an unwillingness to revert to the more draconian mitigation measures and most importantly, expectations of a near-term vaccine breakthrough.\n\n**Biden could end up being tougher on China than Trump:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/world/asia/biden-china-election-trump.html) noted that according to analysts in China, Joe Biden could end up being tougher on China than President Trump if he wins in November. Noted Biden has already promised to take a harder line on climate change and China's crackdowns on ethnic minorities and Hong Kong. In addition, unlike Trump, Biden expected to pursue a multilateral approach with America's allies to push back against China's global ambitions. However, article pointed out that many Chinese officials have come around to the view that China will likely face a harsher political environment in the US, regardless of who wins in November. Biden has already said he would not keep tariffs on China ([NPR](https://twitter.com/lourdesgnavarro/status/1291001056630112262)) and some Wall Street strategists have suggested that a less hawkish approach on trade could offset some of the market concerns surrounding his push for higher corporate taxes.\n\n01:08:07 PM CDT on 23 Sep '20", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 856747, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Top Stories - Wednesday, Sept. 23, 2020", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iyfnqh/top_stories_wednesday_sept_23_2020/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1600881401.0}], [[], false, "psychotrader00", null, [], null, "text", "t2_7gtjd4c0", false, true, [], false, false, 1600807595, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ixvxpi/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_sept_22_enjoy/", {}, "ixvxpi", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 14, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/ixvxpi/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_sept_22_enjoy/", false, 6, 1600807606, 1, " **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, Sept 22, 2020**\n\nStocks traded choppily before rising in another very volatile session, with traders weighing uncertainty around the presidential election, a worsening coronavirus situation in Europe, and concerns that fiscal stimulus will not come in near-term.

More than 850,000 residents face restrictions on travel and the size of gatherings, according to Al Jazeera.

The S&amp;P finished the day 1.12% down, the Nasdaq 1.28% down, the Dow was 0.87% down.\n\nAfter a historic August led by tech stocks, the current volatility in the market has sharply lowered investor sentiment and belief in the prospect of a sharp recovery for the virus-ravaged economy.The still raging pandemic, combined with no fiscal stimulus from Congress, has economists lowering expectations for the remainder of the year. In a note to clients today, Goldman Sachs (GS) said, \u201cAt this point, a major stimulus package before the election looks like a long shot and we expect Congress to leave at the end of September without extending the extra unemployment insurance payment, approving another round of stimulus payments, or providing additional support to small businesses or state and local governments.

House Speaker Pelosi said Democrats could push for more than their previous offer of $2.2T given financial imperative has grown since May, though suggested Democrats aren't prepared to accept less than that ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/516904-pelosi-hard-to-see-dems-supporting-less-than-22t-in-covid-aid)). However, little appetite from Senate Republicans on going above their 'skinny' stimulus bill. [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pelosi-trump-stimulus-checks/2020/09/17/7e507a74-f90c-11ea-a510-f57d8ce76e11_story.html) highlighted how Trump's call this week for Republicans to embrace a larger stimulus has put Pelosi in a bind over whether to hold her ground on the $2.2T or negotiate with White House and placate centrist Democrats fearful of voter blowback. Article noted that with Congress set to leave town in first week of October and not return until after election, situation puts some Democrats facing tough reelection chances in difficult spot.\n\n**Unlike stimulus talks, government-funding negotiations remain on track:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-close-in-on-spending-deal-to-avert-shutdown-11600379832) the latest to highlight continued progress on congressional negotiations about a short-term funding package to keep the government from shutting down after 1-Oct, sidestepping a potential confrontation ahead of the 3-Nov elections. Recall Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi agreed earlier this month to pursue a \"clean\" funding bill unburdened by politically sensitive additions ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/515060-mnuchin-pelosi-reach-informal-deal-to-avoid-government-shutdown)), though today's WSJ notes there have been some discussions about whether to add an extension for flood insurance, funding for highways, or funding to give the government extra time to complete the decennial census.

He also said he dissented because he wanted a stronger commitment to zero rates, and said sustained core inflation at 2% would demonstrate the economy was at full employment. St. Louis' Bullard (non-voter) said that we may be at a moment where there may be some inflation given loose policy, government deficits, and supply deficits across the economy. He also said that he's optimistic the US economy can get back to where it was pre-pandemic, and that 100% of GDP can be produced safely despite COVID-19. Atlanta's Bostic (non-voter) told [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-18/slowing-u-s-economy-needs-more-fiscal-aid-fed-s-bostic-says?sref=4uo0B65n) he will wait for evidence of overheating before taking action, and that he's more concerned with the trajectory of inflation than specific levels.\n\n**US to block TikTok downloads starting Sunday, shutdown app in November if no deal reached:**\n\n* Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Friday that US users will be blocked from downloading TikTok and WeChat starting 20-Sep.

The statement also said that WeChat would also be removed from app stores, and that transactions and payments would be banned on the app Monday. Reports yesterday noted TikTok and Oracle have agreed to the US Treasury terms to complete the transaction though Trump has not issued final approval ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-17/oracle-bytedance-said-to-accept-new-treasury-terms-on-tiktok), [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/technology/tiktok-deal-revisions-trump-review.html?smid=tw-share)), while [WSJ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/technology/tiktok-deal-revisions-trump-review.html?smid=tw-share) reported the deal will still need signoff from China. [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-pushes-for-u-s-control-of-tiktok-11600295711?mod=hp_lead_pos2) also reported Trump administration officials have sought to ensure US investors hold significant majority stake in the company that will take over TikTok, headlined by Oracle (ORCL-US ) and Walmart (WMT-US ).\n\n**Fed survey shows improvement to households' financial strain from government support:**\n\n* The Fed's [update](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2019-report-economic-well-being-us-households-update-202009.pdf) to its Report on the Economic Well-Being of US Households survey, which was conducted in July, said that employment outcomes differed markedly across workers of different incomes and education levels. It also said that the extraordinary governmental measures in response to the pandemic helped ease families' financial strain, with financial well-being higher in the July survey than early April before the financial relief efforts were in place. The report was in line with recent Fed commentary on the need for more fiscal policy stimulus. Fed Chair Powell said in the post-FOMC press conference this week that while fiscal support has been essential to the recent recovery, more fiscal support is likely to be needed given the 11M people still out of work due to the pandemic, struggling small businesses, and declining revenues across state and local governments.\n\n**Companies see higher taxes post-election, no matter who wins:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-brace-for-higher-taxes-after-u-s-election-11600366918) reported that financial executives at major US companies expect corporate tax rates to rise following the November election, no matter who wins, according to PwC survey. Former VP Biden said he supports raising corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, add new surtax to companies that make products overseas and sell them back to US and raise minimum tax on foreign income. Trump hasn't proposed any changes, but the article noted that executives anticipate higher taxes on expectation government will have to fund stimulus spending, tax deferrals, and other federal COVID-related relief. Also said if Trump is re-elected, executives will likely spend more on companies' supply chains to protect against fallout of US-China tensions.", false, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 850881, "public", "self", "Top Stories - Friday, Sept. 18, 2020", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iva9px/top_stories_friday_sept_18_2020/", "all_ads", 6, 1600445744.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "spacej3di", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_kdm2ull", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1600449344, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iva9px/top_stories_friday_sept_18_2020/", "gildings": {}, "id": "iva9px", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "news", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "866eb162-65e6-11e5-a903-1252b640afe9", "link_flair_text": "News", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/iva9px/top_stories_friday_sept_18_2020/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "BsqlFp4JsFXmqYtKwtVXWFByP5U-Nie43EpqaiVXroI", "resolutions": [{"height": 134, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/91fSiu7bzNZtr6Mn20F56ugao2CIZwLE07CxE3OkQ_g.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c6ee6384624c6e1e7f9aaf41c57598d85c10eb1", "width": 108}, {"height": 268, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/91fSiu7bzNZtr6Mn20F56ugao2CIZwLE07CxE3OkQ_g.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d50f77190f4a37f7b788616ba304c95c52424f71", "width": 216}, {"height": 397, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/91fSiu7bzNZtr6Mn20F56ugao2CIZwLE07CxE3OkQ_g.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9945833b1bd3c885a4f33c1b53a93356523dd719", "width": 320}, {"height": 795, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/91fSiu7bzNZtr6Mn20F56ugao2CIZwLE07CxE3OkQ_g.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87c850a53abd0eedfcb18842dc932302833f1b18", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 1090, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/91fSiu7bzNZtr6Mn20F56ugao2CIZwLE07CxE3OkQ_g.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=9d8b093b2ce87439e5934a99ca04b720fe671168", "width": 877}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1600450869, "score": 4, "selftext": "Summarized to save you time.\n\n**Another day of FAANG underperformance weighing on sectors:**\n\n* **REITs** and **utilities** trailing, but session characterized by continued underperformance from the FAANGs and pressure on the requisite sectors.

One scenario features a faster and higher peak in unemployment while the second sees a lower unemployment peak but a slower descent. Board will release firm-specific results from banks' performance under both scenarios by the end of 2020.

Fed hasn't made clear whether second set of tests will replace earlier set of tests, which would raise each firm's capital minimum.\n\n**Preliminary Michigan consumer sentiment rose in early September:**\n\n* Preliminary **Michigan Consumer Sentiment** for Sep of 78.9 versus cons 75, up 4.8 pts from last month. Noted a modest improvement to the top of the range since April with consumers beginning to look towards the presidential election and for release of a coronavirus vaccine. Current conditions index up 4.6 pts to 87.5. Expectations index 4.8 pts higher to 73.3. One-year and five-year inflation expectations fell with the former down 0.4% to 2.7% and the latter down a tenth to 2.6%.

Marks a departure from standard practice where documents are shared after studies are complete. Demand for greater transparency from vaccine developers fueled in part by concerns about political interference in regulatory approval process. Separately, [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/17/coronavirus-vaccine-distribution-trump-states-417407) highlighted how states tasked with leading vaccine distribution efforts face logistical and supply chain challenges that could thwart Trump's optimistic timeline for delivery.\n\n**Stimulus deal remains elusive:**\n\n* [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/17/coronavirus-stimulus-deal-417142) reported Democrats and Republicans appeared further apart on key components of a fifth coronavirus relief bill on Thursday. House Speaker Pelosi said Democrats could push for more than their previous offer of $2.2T given financial imperative has grown since May, though suggested Democrats aren't prepared to accept less than that ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/516904-pelosi-hard-to-see-dems-supporting-less-than-22t-in-covid-aid)). However, little appetite from Senate Republicans on going above their 'skinny' stimulus bill. [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pelosi-trump-stimulus-checks/2020/09/17/7e507a74-f90c-11ea-a510-f57d8ce76e11_story.html) highlighted how Trump's call this week for Republicans to embrace a larger stimulus has put Pelosi in a bind over whether to hold her ground on the $2.2T or negotiate with White House and placate centrist Democrats fearful of voter blowback. Article noted that with Congress set to leave town in first week of October and not return until after election, situation puts some Democrats facing tough reelection chances in difficult spot.\n\n**Unlike stimulus talks, government-funding negotiations remain on track:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-close-in-on-spending-deal-to-avert-shutdown-11600379832) the latest to highlight continued progress on congressional negotiations about a short-term funding package to keep the government from shutting down after 1-Oct, sidestepping a potential confrontation ahead of the 3-Nov elections. Recall Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi agreed earlier this month to pursue a \"clean\" funding bill unburdened by politically sensitive additions ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/515060-mnuchin-pelosi-reach-informal-deal-to-avoid-government-shutdown)), though today's WSJ notes there have been some discussions about whether to add an extension for flood insurance, funding for highways, or funding to give the government extra time to complete the decennial census. Lawmakers and aides said they were finishing up discussions and could have a bill ready for introduction to the House around midday today.\n\n**A busy day of Fedspeak ahead after this week's FOMC meeting:**\n\n* In an essay \"[Why I Dissented](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2020/why-i-dissented),\" Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari (voter) said the Fed should hold off on rate hikes until roughly a year of 2% core inflation. He also said he dissented because he wanted a stronger commitment to zero rates, and said sustained core inflation at 2% would demonstrate the economy was at full employment. St. Louis' Bullard (non-voter) said that we may be at a moment where there may be some inflation given loose policy, government deficits, and supply deficits across the economy. He also said that he's optimistic the US economy can get back to where it was pre-pandemic, and that 100% of GDP can be produced safely despite COVID-19. Atlanta's Bostic (non-voter) told [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-18/slowing-u-s-economy-needs-more-fiscal-aid-fed-s-bostic-says?sref=4uo0B65n) he will wait for evidence of overheating before taking action, and that he's more concerned with the trajectory of inflation than specific levels.\n\n**US to block TikTok downloads starting Sunday, shutdown app in November if no deal reached:**\n\n* Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Friday that US users will be blocked from downloading TikTok and WeChat starting 20-Sep. TikTok will also be shut down would come 12-Nov if no deal is reached ([statement](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/09/commerce-department-prohibits-wechat-and-tiktok-transactions-protect), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-ban-exclusive/exclusive-trump-to-block-u-s-downloads-of-tiktok-wechat-on-sunday-officials-idUSKBN2691QO?il=0), [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/c460ce4c-c691-4df5-af49-47a395429fe8?shareType=nongift)). The statement also said that WeChat would also be removed from app stores, and that transactions and payments would be banned on the app Monday. Reports yesterday noted TikTok and Oracle have agreed to the US Treasury terms to complete the transaction though Trump has not issued final approval ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-17/oracle-bytedance-said-to-accept-new-treasury-terms-on-tiktok), [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/technology/tiktok-deal-revisions-trump-review.html?smid=tw-share)), while [WSJ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/technology/tiktok-deal-revisions-trump-review.html?smid=tw-share) reported the deal will still need signoff from China. [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-pushes-for-u-s-control-of-tiktok-11600295711?mod=hp_lead_pos2) also reported Trump administration officials have sought to ensure US investors hold significant majority stake in the company that will take over TikTok, headlined by Oracle (ORCL-US ) and Walmart (WMT-US ).\n\n**Fed survey shows improvement to households' financial strain from government support:**\n\n* The Fed's [update](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2019-report-economic-well-being-us-households-update-202009.pdf) to its Report on the Economic Well-Being of US Households survey, which was conducted in July, said that employment outcomes differed markedly across workers of different incomes and education levels. It also said that the extraordinary governmental measures in response to the pandemic helped ease families' financial strain, with financial well-being higher in the July survey than early April before the financial relief efforts were in place. The report was in line with recent Fed commentary on the need for more fiscal policy stimulus. Fed Chair Powell said in the post-FOMC press conference this week that while fiscal support has been essential to the recent recovery, more fiscal support is likely to be needed given the 11M people still out of work due to the pandemic, struggling small businesses, and declining revenues across state and local governments.\n\n**Companies see higher taxes post-election, no matter who wins:**\n\n* [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-brace-for-higher-taxes-after-u-s-election-11600366918) reported that financial executives at major US companies expect corporate tax rates to rise following the November election, no matter who wins, according to PwC survey. Former VP Biden said he supports raising corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, add new surtax to companies that make products overseas and sell them back to US and raise minimum tax on foreign income. Trump hasn't proposed any changes, but the article noted that executives anticipate higher taxes on expectation government will have to fund stimulus spending, tax deferrals, and other federal COVID-related relief. Also said if Trump is re-elected, executives will likely spend more on companies' supply chains to protect against fallout of US-China tensions.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 850881, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Top Stories - Friday, Sept. 18, 2020", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iva9px/top_stories_friday_sept_18_2020/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1600445744.0}], [[], false, "psychotrader00", null, [], null, "text", "t2_7gtjd4c0", false, true, [], false, false, 1600373341, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iurbkw/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_sept_17_2020/", {}, "iurbkw", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 23, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/iurbkw/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_sept_17_2020/", false, "self", {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Ai9gATr7e7o9SX2VFix1X-lM87FBwTuVHQFd2ppI-bY", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CIMiZ8vIC313Iy4sc1IUqWReAOeED7VH95UsCLqhLq4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f92afb8c030f0ee4ff2ff10275321612499c2fad", "width": 108}], "source": {"height": 200, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CIMiZ8vIC313Iy4sc1IUqWReAOeED7VH95UsCLqhLq4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=762c35a823e5583371594389042098bcd3f3c153", "width": 200}, "variants": {}}]}, 6, 1600373351, 1, " **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, Sept 17, 2020**\n\nStocks ended sharply down in a volatile trading session, as investors and traders became more cautious following the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement yesterday and conflicting information and timeframes regarding a potential coronavirus vaccine.\n\nThe sell-off was led by big tech stocks, like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Apple (AAPL), which extended yesterday\u2019s losses and soured overall market sentiment.

The Fed signaled that interest rates would remain at near-zero through 2023 in an attempt to buoy the virus-stricken economy.\n\nIn their report, the FOMC once again reiterated that \u2018the path of economic recovery will depend significantly on the course of the virus \\[coronavirus\\]\u201d. They said, \u201cThe ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term\u201d.\n\nOn a positive note, the Fed\u2019s outlook for economic contraction was less dire compared to previous months, suggesting a rising level of optimism in the Fed\u2019s projections. The Fed forecast a 3.7% contraction in real GDP and an unemployment rate of 7.6% by the end of the year, versus its June outlook for a 6.5% GDP contraction and jobless rate of 9.3%. The Fed also added that it would continue its current Treasury and mortgage-backed securities purchases \u201cat least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions.\u201d\n\nOnce again, in his statements Powell urged lawmakers to pass more fiscal stimulus to provide direct support to small businesses and households, stating that the initial faster-than-expected economic recovery could be threatened with the enhanced unemployment numbers as direct support measures expire. Both Powell and other FOMC members have repeatedly underscored the importance of both robust monetary and fiscal policy to economic recovery. Powell said\u201d \u201cThe people who worked in those service jobs, particularly the entry-level, lower-paid workers, they're the ones who are most vulnerable.

created a recent deal spree in the used car market and I've been able to capitalize on acquiring a few dream cars + daily drivers for my mini fleet... Through CVNA clones.\n\nI've been disappointed with Carvana due to constantly desirable cars being tagged \"pending sale\" or \"coming soon\"  in my area. I discovered a competitor called [Shift.com](https://shift.com/) built by FB/Dropbox alumni and their experience has been amazing - I've gotten two amazing deals on a dream car + a daily driver with no complaints on the transaction.\n\nI was particularly looking for a 2017-2019 luxury suv and nothing in my area was coming up available... literally every Range Rover, Porsche Macan/Cayenne, Lexus or BMW mid-size+, etc.. was \"pending sale\". Upon finding [Shift.com](https://shift.com/), I stumbled into two deals I couldn't pass on and ended up getting a Maserati Levante (love it).\n\nThings I've noticed about Shift: they book 1 test drive per vehicle per day. They don't use branded tow-trucks and just shuttle the vehicle to you... Which is fine. They had very good incentives for trade-ins (giving bonuses for same-day deals) and I had no problem finding a certified vehicle with low mileage/newer/priced under kbb. Very impressed and satisfied with the experience.

My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -&gt; Aug. \n\nI beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180-&gt;300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)\n\nI did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. \n\nI did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. \n\n#High level advice:\n=========================================\n\nhttps://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/37-top-10-pieces-of-investment-advice-from-warren-buffett\n\nI picked the 7 I agree with.\n\n1. Invest in what you know\u2026and nothing more.\n2. Never compromise on business quality\n3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever\n4. Diversification can be dangerous\n5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)\n8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)\n10. Only listen to those you know and trust \n\nI firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  \n\n#General mindset:\n================\n- Keep emotions out of the market\n- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.\n- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. \n- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. \n- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)\n- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. \n\n#Application:\n==================================================================\nI was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. \n\nAs a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. \n\nBased on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good \"feel\" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). \n\nI tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. \n\nPost COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.\n\nMy hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. \n\n1. eCommerce + AdTech \n2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)\n3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)\n\nThese are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:\n\n1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?\n2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?\n3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? \n4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?\n5. Who are their customers and target demographic?\n6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.\n\nIn March, I took what I believe to be an \"educated gamble\". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.\n\nI have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.\n\nHere are the non FAANGs I chose.\n\n1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&amp;M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. \n\n2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.\n\n3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. \n\n4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.\n\n5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. \n\n6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.\n\n7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. \"Zoom parties\" and \"Zoom dates\" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.\n\n8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. \n\n10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.\n\n11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. \n\n12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. \n\n13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say \"Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?\" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.\n\n14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.\n\nMutual funds/ETFs\n1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. \n\n2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. \n\n3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... \n\nTitanvest:\nI was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.\n\n#Some things I do that that are against the grain:\n\n- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.\n\n- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.\n\n- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. \n\nOne example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. \n\nLastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. \n\nAlso, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech.

My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -&gt; Aug. \n\nI beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180-&gt;300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)\n\nI did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. \n\nI did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. \n\n#High level advice:\n=========================================\n\nhttps://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/37-top-10-pieces-of-investment-advice-from-warren-buffett\n\nI picked the 7 I agree with.\n\n1. Invest in what you know\u2026and nothing more.\n2. Never compromise on business quality\n3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever\n4. Diversification can be dangerous\n5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)\n8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)\n10. Only listen to those you know and trust \n\nI firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  \n\n#General mindset:\n================\n- Keep emotions out of the market\n- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.\n- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. \n- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. \n- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)\n- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. \n\n#Application:\n==================================================================\nI was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. \n\nAs a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. \n\nBased on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good \"feel\" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). \n\nI tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. \n\nPost COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.\n\nMy hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. \n\n1. eCommerce + AdTech \n2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)\n3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)\n\nThese are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:\n\n1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?\n2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?\n3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? \n4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?\n5. Who are their customers and target demographic?\n6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.\n\nIn March, I took what I believe to be an \"educated gamble\". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.\n\nI have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.\n\nHere are the non FAANGs I chose.\n\n1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&amp;M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. \n\n2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.\n\n3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. \n\n4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.\n\n5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. \n\n6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.\n\n7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. \"Zoom parties\" and \"Zoom dates\" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.\n\n8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. \n\n10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.\n\n11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. \n\n12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. \n\n13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say \"Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?\" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.\n\n14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.\n\nMutual funds/ETFs\n1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. \n\n2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. \n\n3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... \n\nTitanvest:\nI was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.\n\n#Some things I do that that are against the grain:\n\n- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.\n\n- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.\n\n- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. \n\nOne example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. \n\nLastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. \n\nAlso, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in.

Every day the extension tells me whether AMZN is up or down.\n\nI put it on all the browser stores: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stock-inspector-discover/bjbgncfjoplpeldfafkkdpmdpkhkmadb), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stock-inspector-discover-etfs/), [Edge](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stock-inspector-discover/bjbgncfjoplpeldfafkkdpmdpkhkmadb). It's free.\n\nSome stuff people asked me so far that I'm working on next:\n\n* Does the stock pay dividends?\n* Is the company healthy in this COVID world? (cash position etc)\n* A watch list\n\nDo you find this helpful?

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/the-jobs-report-and-congressional-politics-may-matter-more-for-markets-than-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The market could lose some of its exuberance in the week ahead as the calendar turns to August, and investors await Friday\u2019s July employment report and keep their eyes on Washington.\n*****\n&gt; The focus will also be squarely on politicians, as Congress struggles to find a middle ground on a new fiscal spending package and decide the fate of the $600 a week unemployment supplement that was set to expire July 31. Former vice president Joe Biden is also expected to name his running mate in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; The jobs data will be crucial, particularly since the number of people filing for unemployment benefits has been edging higher, instead of falling back, as expected. According to Refinitiv, about 1.36 million new jobs are expected, well below the 4.8 million added in June, and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.7% from 11.1%.\n*****\n&gt; Trading around the report could be volatile, since some economists expect more than 2 million jobs were added, and some even see flat or negative payrolls.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have done well for the month of July, with the S&amp;P 500 finishing at 3,271, a gain of 5.5%. The Nasdaq has performed the best, rising 6.8% for the month to 10,745, after a 3.7% gain for the past week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAugust has traditionally been a challenging month for investors,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The market is entering what historically has been the worst two months for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; According to Stovall, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher in August 53% of the time, and its average move is a gain of just 0.01%, going back to World War II. September is worse, down 0.51% on average, and up just 48% of the time.\n*****\n&gt; In presidential election years, however the odds for August gains are better, as it rose 63% of the time and 73%, when the incumbent is up for re-election.\n*****\n&gt; There are also about 120 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, but the big earnings show for markets was this past week when four of the five biggest tech giants all reported Thursday afternoon. Three of those stocks \u2014 Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 surged, helping Nasdaq outperform Friday with a more than 1.5% gain.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings scorecard\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re only a month into the reporting period, and things are going to become less and less important from an earnings perspective,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cI think investors are sort of disappointed in that the bar was set so low for second quarter earnings that expectations were that we were going to see a lot of companies beat, which we have. But we were also going to see a gradual uplift of earnings expectations for forward quarters. We\u2019re not seeing that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Eighty-two percent of the companies reporting so far have beaten estimates, well above the average 65%, according to Refinitiv. The earnings decline is now looking closer to 33% from an initial 40%, and tech, which has been leading the market is one of the best performers. Profits for the sector now look to be up 1.4%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Because the tech names have contributed so much to market gains, their earnings were an important test for the market, and they didn\u2019t disappoint. But they didn\u2019t manage to pull up the whole market very far on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Among the names reporting in the coming week are a diverse group, including Disney, ViacomCBS, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Berkshire Hathaway, AIG, Clorox, and Wayfair, to name a few.\n*****\n&gt; # Politics now in play\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings story is over. My call had been once we had gotten through the earnings season, we would be more vulnerable to a sustainable pullback,\u201d said Barry Knapp, Ironside Macroeconomics managing partner and director of research. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s volatility season, but it\u2019s also an election year. ... We\u2019re more vulnerable to that next week and earnings won\u2019t hold us up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said if President Donald Trump and Republicans do not begin to perform better in the polls by Labor Day, the market is likely to focus on what a Democratic win would mean for taxes and regulation. That could be a negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf he hasn\u2019t made headway by then, it\u2019s likely he\u2019s done.That\u2019s about the point when things become pretty set in stone. The market will presume that\u2019s the case,\u201d Knapp said.\n*****\n&gt; The politics of the stimulus package could also reverberate through markets, until it looks like the Senate Republicans and House Democrats can find common ground.\n*****\n&gt; The two sides look to be at a standoff, but an agreement is still expected in early August. The market is particularly watching to see what happens with the enhanced unemployment benefits. Republicans have proposed cutting it to $200, but Democrats support keeping it.\n*****\n&gt; # The economy\n&gt; Cutting the size of the payments back might be good for the labor market and persuade more workers to return to work, some strategists say. However, there is also concern that the funding has helped stimulate the economy and keep the unemployed from defaulting on loans and payments. Consumer spending on goods in June was even higher than last year, and that was also seen as getting a lift from stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the jobs report, there are other important data like ISM manufacturing on Monday. There are also monthly vehicle sales Monday, and ISM nonmanufacturing data Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the macro data is going to be fine next week,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cI\u2019m not in the camp that thinks the payroll number is going to be negative.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; NatWest Markets economist Kevin Cummins is one of the economists who expects the jobs gains to be much smaller than the past two months. He expects the payrolls to come in at just 200,000. \u201cYou look at jobless claims, and you see a stalling out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Fed is right. There is significant downside risk to the economy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # A trade to watch\n&gt; Treasury yields, in the 2-year to 7-year range, fell to new lows in the past week. The 10-year yield, not yet at a record low, was also falling and was at 0.53% Friday. At the same time, the dollar was down more than 1% on the week and 4% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Gold was a beneficiary of the lower interest rates, weaker dollar trade, rising about 5% for the week and 10% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Strategist say investors are reacting to super-low interest rates, concerns about the economy, and the possibility that huge government spending will send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Investors are also jumping into inflation-protected bonds. According to Refinitiv\u2019s Lipper, inflation-protected bond funds took in $271 million of net new money for the fund-flows week ended July 29, the sixth week of gains. About $1 billion went into the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, (GLD) in the last week, Lipper said.\n*****\n&gt; During this time period, the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities funds recorded their two best weekly net inflows ever with increases of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the fund-flows weeks of June 24 and July 1.\n*****\n&gt; Lipper said investors started to put money into TIPS funds in the middle of the second quarter, and the flows have been . net positive in 11 out of 13 weeks since the beginning of May. This its second-worst quarterly net outflows ever as oil prices slumped in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this is going to be a much more inflationary decade. It will start out slowly. [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell is right that more forces are putting downward pressure on inflation at present. But the market looks past that,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cThe big story in 2021 will be the recovery of inflation. You\u2019re already seeing it in import prices.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Vu3udbe.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/h0BBbe1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LKORgeK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/MZnSQFC8/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LhH7odo.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/p9QIWyG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HmN0IBf.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZlnNJZU.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/wvkv3FfP/er83720.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vu4Bq8q.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/kKZeaRL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/O6zeqaG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SkGddqX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/5XLqRrO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/zl5gQpo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August: Top NASDAQ &amp; Russell 2000 Month of Election Years\n\n&gt; August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 32 years, 1988-2019 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.\n\n&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%\u2014which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts\u2019 average decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e8afe7e1e8656f8b9beeaf3291cf8f62/02ca1964ef3531ea-f0/s400x600/77f035157f33a261b7608dc9cc36fc09a768f385.jpg))**\n\n&gt; However, in election years since 1950, Augusts\u2019 rankings improve: #6 DJIA, #5 S&amp;P 500, #1 NASDAQ (since 1971), #1 Russell 1000 and #1 Russell 2000 (since 1979). This year, the market\u2019s performance in August will likely depend heavily on how July closes and whether or not the rate of covid-19 infection continues to accelerate which could force some areas to roll back reopenings.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August\u2019s First Trading Day Bearish Last 23 Years\n\n&gt; From the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 (page 88), it is known that the first trading days of each month combined gain nearly as much as all other days combined. However, the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2020 Almanac. In the past 23 years DJIA has risen just 30.4% (up 7, down 16) of the time on the first trading day of August. Average and median losses are on the mild side due to a few sizable advances. Over the past nine years, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have both declined nine times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8f6234b8e365d9e861563b4d5b2efa5d/42d5f6b50757b324-8c/s500x750/6269fe4480533724c565c9852bf543a4c59ea172.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Stronger Underneath the Surface\n\n&gt; Earlier today we posted a chart showing S&amp;P 500 sector performance since the Nasdaq's recent peak on 7/20 when Technology stocks began what has now been a 10-day period of consolidation. Below we have updated these performance numbers to include today's moves. While not as many sectors remain in positive territory, the majority of sectors continue to outperform the S&amp;P 500, while Technology drags the market lower. Along with Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary are the only other sectors that have lagged the S&amp;P 500, and their performance has been dragged down by the mega-cap tech-like stocks of Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Expanding on this theme of underlying strength in the index, the chart below shows the average performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 grouped by sector. On an equal-weighted basis, the S&amp;P 500 is actually up 1.3% since 7/20, and only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen negative average returns. On the upside, Real Estate (4.1%) has been the big winner followed by Consumer Discretionary (3.3%), and Consumer Staples (2.2%). The fact that Consumer Discretionary at the cap-weighted sector level is down over 1.4% while the average performance of stocks in the sector has been a gain of 3.3% illustrates what a mammoth impact AMZN has on that sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Breadth among S&amp;P 500 stocks has also been overwhelmingly positive. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, 59% of stocks in the index have had positive returns since the close on 7/20. Only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen fewer than half of their components post positive returns over that time, while Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Utilities have seen roughly three-quarters of their components rally since 7/20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Percent-Up1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far\n\n&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**\n\n&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/eps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # China Running Away YTD\n\n&gt; Every Wednesday, we publish our Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high-level summary of market and economic data of some of the world's largest economies. Of the 23 stock markets tracked, just six including the US are positive year to date at the moment (in local currency). In the chart below we show the YTD performance of these six countries as well as the global median in 2020. As shown, even though it was actually the first to tip into the green YTD following the global sell-off in February and March very briefly back in early June, the US is up the least of this group with a YTD gain of 0.4%. China's stock market is up the most at +14%. Taiwan, South Korea, South Africa, and Malaysia are also outperforming the US but are up more modestly than China with the best of these, Taiwan, gaining 4.53% this year. Meanwhile, the median country in our Global Macro Dashboard remains down 6.2% YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-GMD-ytd.png))**\n\n&gt; Given it is up the most on a year to date basis, China has also gained the largest share of global equity market cap in 2020. As shown in the table below, China has gained 1.7 percentage points of global market cap in 2020 and now takes up 10.14%. China now joins the US as the only other country with a double-digit share of total world market cap. Despite this, China has actually lost share since the bear market lows on 3/23. Meanwhile, the US, Germany, Canada, India, South Korea, and Australia have all gained a significant share since 3/23.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-Mkt-Cap-World.png))**\n\n&gt; # Do the Top 5 Stocks Pose a Risk to the Market?\n\n&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. These five stocks have helped spawn a number of acronyms as they try to capture the rise of mega-cap tech stocks that have led the market higher for much of the past decade. The average return for those five stocks so far this year has been a gain of more than 30%, while the broad S&amp;P 500 Index is just marginally positive, at 0.4% through July 30.\n\n&gt; While many other areas of the market have remained largely static, the total market value of these stocks has dramatically increased, making them an increasingly large piece of market cap-weighted indexes such as the S&amp;P 500. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the combined weight of the top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 has increased to its highest level ever, at nearly 22%. Only one of those five stocks (Microsoft) was a top five name in the index during the previous peak of March 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But does this pose a risk to the index? From a diversification standpoint, one could certainly argue it does. For instance, if any shared risks should come up, from regulation, for example, it could do outsized damage to cap-weighted indexes. However, we believe that the recent gains have been justified by the fundamentals, and we continue to favor both large caps over small caps, and growth-style stocks over value stocks. According to analysis from Credit Suisse, over the past 12 months, the top five stocks in the index have grown revenues at 11.2% vs. just 0.8% for the rest of the S&amp;P 500. Further, the remainder of the S&amp;P 500 has subtracted roughly $17 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS), while the top five stocks have added more than $12.\n\n&gt; Finally, while these stocks have been the face of the recent \u201cstay-at-home trend\u201d and may be more insulated from broader economic weakness, they are far from the only stocks making money this year. On July 30, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index hit a new all-time high and is now up more than 15% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; \u201cAfter a huge run, many of these top stocks may be due for a pause,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, looking out over the next 6 to 12 months, we believe that investors will continue to place a premium on companies that are able to organically grow sales, especially in a low-growth environment.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/the-jobs-report-and-congressional-politics-may-matter-more-for-markets-than-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The market could lose some of its exuberance in the week ahead as the calendar turns to August, and investors await Friday\u2019s July employment report and keep their eyes on Washington.\n*****\n&gt; The focus will also be squarely on politicians, as Congress struggles to find a middle ground on a new fiscal spending package and decide the fate of the $600 a week unemployment supplement that was set to expire July 31. Former vice president Joe Biden is also expected to name his running mate in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; The jobs data will be crucial, particularly since the number of people filing for unemployment benefits has been edging higher, instead of falling back, as expected. According to Refinitiv, about 1.36 million new jobs are expected, well below the 4.8 million added in June, and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.7% from 11.1%.\n*****\n&gt; Trading around the report could be volatile, since some economists expect more than 2 million jobs were added, and some even see flat or negative payrolls.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have done well for the month of July, with the S&amp;P 500 finishing at 3,271, a gain of 5.5%. The Nasdaq has performed the best, rising 6.8% for the month to 10,745, after a 3.7% gain for the past week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAugust has traditionally been a challenging month for investors,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The market is entering what historically has been the worst two months for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; According to Stovall, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher in August 53% of the time, and its average move is a gain of just 0.01%, going back to World War II. September is worse, down 0.51% on average, and up just 48% of the time.\n*****\n&gt; In presidential election years, however the odds for August gains are better, as it rose 63% of the time and 73%, when the incumbent is up for re-election.\n*****\n&gt; There are also about 120 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, but the big earnings show for markets was this past week when four of the five biggest tech giants all reported Thursday afternoon. Three of those stocks \u2014 Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 surged, helping Nasdaq outperform Friday with a more than 1.5% gain.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings scorecard\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re only a month into the reporting period, and things are going to become less and less important from an earnings perspective,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cI think investors are sort of disappointed in that the bar was set so low for second quarter earnings that expectations were that we were going to see a lot of companies beat, which we have. But we were also going to see a gradual uplift of earnings expectations for forward quarters. We\u2019re not seeing that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Eighty-two percent of the companies reporting so far have beaten estimates, well above the average 65%, according to Refinitiv. The earnings decline is now looking closer to 33% from an initial 40%, and tech, which has been leading the market is one of the best performers. Profits for the sector now look to be up 1.4%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Because the tech names have contributed so much to market gains, their earnings were an important test for the market, and they didn\u2019t disappoint. But they didn\u2019t manage to pull up the whole market very far on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Among the names reporting in the coming week are a diverse group, including Disney, ViacomCBS, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Berkshire Hathaway, AIG, Clorox, and Wayfair, to name a few.\n*****\n&gt; # Politics now in play\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings story is over. My call had been once we had gotten through the earnings season, we would be more vulnerable to a sustainable pullback,\u201d said Barry Knapp, Ironside Macroeconomics managing partner and director of research. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s volatility season, but it\u2019s also an election year. ... We\u2019re more vulnerable to that next week and earnings won\u2019t hold us up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said if President Donald Trump and Republicans do not begin to perform better in the polls by Labor Day, the market is likely to focus on what a Democratic win would mean for taxes and regulation. That could be a negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf he hasn\u2019t made headway by then, it\u2019s likely he\u2019s done.That\u2019s about the point when things become pretty set in stone. The market will presume that\u2019s the case,\u201d Knapp said.\n*****\n&gt; The politics of the stimulus package could also reverberate through markets, until it looks like the Senate Republicans and House Democrats can find common ground.\n*****\n&gt; The two sides look to be at a standoff, but an agreement is still expected in early August. The market is particularly watching to see what happens with the enhanced unemployment benefits. Republicans have proposed cutting it to $200, but Democrats support keeping it.\n*****\n&gt; # The economy\n&gt; Cutting the size of the payments back might be good for the labor market and persuade more workers to return to work, some strategists say. However, there is also concern that the funding has helped stimulate the economy and keep the unemployed from defaulting on loans and payments. Consumer spending on goods in June was even higher than last year, and that was also seen as getting a lift from stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the jobs report, there are other important data like ISM manufacturing on Monday. There are also monthly vehicle sales Monday, and ISM nonmanufacturing data Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the macro data is going to be fine next week,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cI\u2019m not in the camp that thinks the payroll number is going to be negative.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; NatWest Markets economist Kevin Cummins is one of the economists who expects the jobs gains to be much smaller than the past two months. He expects the payrolls to come in at just 200,000. \u201cYou look at jobless claims, and you see a stalling out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Fed is right. There is significant downside risk to the economy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # A trade to watch\n&gt; Treasury yields, in the 2-year to 7-year range, fell to new lows in the past week. The 10-year yield, not yet at a record low, was also falling and was at 0.53% Friday. At the same time, the dollar was down more than 1% on the week and 4% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Gold was a beneficiary of the lower interest rates, weaker dollar trade, rising about 5% for the week and 10% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Strategist say investors are reacting to super-low interest rates, concerns about the economy, and the possibility that huge government spending will send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Investors are also jumping into inflation-protected bonds. According to Refinitiv\u2019s Lipper, inflation-protected bond funds took in $271 million of net new money for the fund-flows week ended July 29, the sixth week of gains. About $1 billion went into the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, (GLD) in the last week, Lipper said.\n*****\n&gt; During this time period, the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities funds recorded their two best weekly net inflows ever with increases of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the fund-flows weeks of June 24 and July 1.\n*****\n&gt; Lipper said investors started to put money into TIPS funds in the middle of the second quarter, and the flows have been . net positive in 11 out of 13 weeks since the beginning of May. This its second-worst quarterly net outflows ever as oil prices slumped in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this is going to be a much more inflationary decade. It will start out slowly. [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell is right that more forces are putting downward pressure on inflation at present.

It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 32 years, 1988-2019 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.\n\n&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%\u2014which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts\u2019 average decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e8afe7e1e8656f8b9beeaf3291cf8f62/02ca1964ef3531ea-f0/s400x600/77f035157f33a261b7608dc9cc36fc09a768f385.jpg))**\n\n&gt; However, in election years since 1950, Augusts\u2019 rankings improve: #6 DJIA, #5 S&amp;P 500, #1 NASDAQ (since 1971), #1 Russell 1000 and #1 Russell 2000 (since 1979). This year, the market\u2019s performance in August will likely depend heavily on how July closes and whether or not the rate of covid-19 infection continues to accelerate which could force some areas to roll back reopenings.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August\u2019s First Trading Day Bearish Last 23 Years\n\n&gt; From the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 (page 88), it is known that the first trading days of each month combined gain nearly as much as all other days combined. However, the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2020 Almanac. In the past 23 years DJIA has risen just 30.4% (up 7, down 16) of the time on the first trading day of August. Average and median losses are on the mild side due to a few sizable advances. Over the past nine years, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have both declined nine times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8f6234b8e365d9e861563b4d5b2efa5d/42d5f6b50757b324-8c/s500x750/6269fe4480533724c565c9852bf543a4c59ea172.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Stronger Underneath the Surface\n\n&gt; Earlier today we posted a chart showing S&amp;P 500 sector performance since the Nasdaq's recent peak on 7/20 when Technology stocks began what has now been a 10-day period of consolidation. Below we have updated these performance numbers to include today's moves. While not as many sectors remain in positive territory, the majority of sectors continue to outperform the S&amp;P 500, while Technology drags the market lower. Along with Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary are the only other sectors that have lagged the S&amp;P 500, and their performance has been dragged down by the mega-cap tech-like stocks of Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Expanding on this theme of underlying strength in the index, the chart below shows the average performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 grouped by sector. On an equal-weighted basis, the S&amp;P 500 is actually up 1.3% since 7/20, and only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen negative average returns. On the upside, Real Estate (4.1%) has been the big winner followed by Consumer Discretionary (3.3%), and Consumer Staples (2.2%). The fact that Consumer Discretionary at the cap-weighted sector level is down over 1.4% while the average performance of stocks in the sector has been a gain of 3.3% illustrates what a mammoth impact AMZN has on that sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Breadth among S&amp;P 500 stocks has also been overwhelmingly positive. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, 59% of stocks in the index have had positive returns since the close on 7/20. Only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen fewer than half of their components post positive returns over that time, while Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Utilities have seen roughly three-quarters of their components rally since 7/20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Percent-Up1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far\n\n&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**\n\n&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/eps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # China Running Away YTD\n\n&gt; Every Wednesday, we publish our Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high-level summary of market and economic data of some of the world's largest economies. Of the 23 stock markets tracked, just six including the US are positive year to date at the moment (in local currency). In the chart below we show the YTD performance of these six countries as well as the global median in 2020. As shown, even though it was actually the first to tip into the green YTD following the global sell-off in February and March very briefly back in early June, the US is up the least of this group with a YTD gain of 0.4%. China's stock market is up the most at +14%. Taiwan, South Korea, South Africa, and Malaysia are also outperforming the US but are up more modestly than China with the best of these, Taiwan, gaining 4.53% this year. Meanwhile, the median country in our Global Macro Dashboard remains down 6.2% YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-GMD-ytd.png))**\n\n&gt; Given it is up the most on a year to date basis, China has also gained the largest share of global equity market cap in 2020. As shown in the table below, China has gained 1.7 percentage points of global market cap in 2020 and now takes up 10.14%. China now joins the US as the only other country with a double-digit share of total world market cap. Despite this, China has actually lost share since the bear market lows on 3/23. Meanwhile, the US, Germany, Canada, India, South Korea, and Australia have all gained a significant share since 3/23.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-Mkt-Cap-World.png))**\n\n&gt; # Do the Top 5 Stocks Pose a Risk to the Market?\n\n&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. These five stocks have helped spawn a number of acronyms as they try to capture the rise of mega-cap tech stocks that have led the market higher for much of the past decade. The average return for those five stocks so far this year has been a gain of more than 30%, while the broad S&amp;P 500 Index is just marginally positive, at 0.4% through July 30.\n\n&gt; While many other areas of the market have remained largely static, the total market value of these stocks has dramatically increased, making them an increasingly large piece of market cap-weighted indexes such as the S&amp;P 500. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the combined weight of the top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 has increased to its highest level ever, at nearly 22%. Only one of those five stocks (Microsoft) was a top five name in the index during the previous peak of March 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But does this pose a risk to the index? From a diversification standpoint, one could certainly argue it does. For instance, if any shared risks should come up, from regulation, for example, it could do outsized damage to cap-weighted indexes. However, we believe that the recent gains have been justified by the fundamentals, and we continue to favor both large caps over small caps, and growth-style stocks over value stocks. According to analysis from Credit Suisse, over the past 12 months, the top five stocks in the index have grown revenues at 11.2% vs. just 0.8% for the rest of the S&amp;P 500. Further, the remainder of the S&amp;P 500 has subtracted roughly $17 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS), while the top five stocks have added more than $12.\n\n&gt; Finally, while these stocks have been the face of the recent \u201cstay-at-home trend\u201d and may be more insulated from broader economic weakness, they are far from the only stocks making money this year. On July 30, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index hit a new all-time high and is now up more than 15% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; \u201cAfter a huge run, many of these top stocks may be due for a pause,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, looking out over the next 6 to 12 months, we believe that investors will continue to place a premium on companies that are able to organically grow sales, especially in a low-growth environment.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/here-comes-one-of-the-newsiest-and-most-critical-weeks-of-the-summer-for-markets.html)**\n*****\n&gt; In a summer of unending news, we may be heading into what could be the newsiest week of all.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq\u2019s sputtering rally could be put to its biggest test yet, as tech bellwether Apple and other stalwarts of the tech rally report earnings. Early in the week, Republicans will unveil their stimulus package proposal, which will then be debated as Friday\u2019s deadline nears for the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve also meets on and is likely to discuss other steps it can take. It\u2019s not likely, however, to make any moves as it wraps up on Wednesday, other than to assure markets it will continue to use extraordinary programs to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Then on Thursday, the government will release a big number many investors have been dreading \u2014 the first official reading of second quarter gross domestic product, which which should show how hard the economy crashed when it was abruptly shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a contraction of about 35% in the second quarter, followed by a bounce back in the third quarter. But the size of that comeback could be directly impacted by how much stimulus Congress gives the economy, and how much the coronavirus continues to impact businesses and economic activity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s a clear understanding of how much the economy has leaned on the crutch of government stimulus, both fiscally and monetarily,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cEveryone will be watching for what will replace the $600 a week, and that will be the most important component of whatever plan they come up with.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The $600 weekly payment to about 30 million unemployed Americans expires Friday, and it is unlikely Congress will have a plan before that date. Strategists expect the amount to be cut in half, and Boockvar said the amount of that payment will directly impact the size of the boost to the economy\n*****\n&gt; The stimulus and tech earnings could both be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat the package looks like will be a huge deal, particularly on the unemployment benefits side, and whether tech companies can exceed the bar,\u201d said Boockvar. \u201cThat\u2019s very hard for them right now. So if they miss, does that mean it\u2019s going to be a negative for tech and not the whole market? Are we going to keep rotating to value from growth because tech has been so dominant it could take everything down?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to decline by 40.3% for the second quarter, based on the results of companies that have already reported and estimates, according to Refinifiv\u2019s I/B/E/S. Technology earnings are expected to have one of the smallest profit declines, at just 4.4% on average.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, which had rallied to record highs this summer, ended lower for a second week, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings numbers overall, they\u2019ve been pretty good. It\u2019s just the basic problem with the stock market right now is that valuations are still pretty high,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cOther parts of the market that maybe look cheap on a price-to-book basis, their earnings have been hit. In the case of certain retailers, airlines, you have to worry about when their business is going to come back, if ever.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 80% of the companies already reporting have beaten Wall Street estimates. That is well above the average beat rate of about 65%, since 1994.\n*****\n&gt; Dozens of major companies report in the coming week, including Facebook on Wednesday and Alphabet and Amazon on Thursday. Pharmaceuticals Merck, Pfizer and Eli Lilly are expected to report, and consumer products names Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and Procter &amp; Gamble also release results. Big oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron report Friday.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus from Congress and the Fed\n&gt; Strategists expect Congress to ultimately adopt a new stimulus package of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, but after the GOP plan is introduced it will have to be squared with Democrats\u2019 proposals. The House has its own $3 trillion spending plan. It is unlikely an agreement can be approved before unemployment benefits expire Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBipartisan negotiations between the White House, House, and Senate are officially underway, but we expect brinkmanship before passage. Trump administration officials also diverge on their expectations on timing, which remains optimistically by the end of July, and possibly stretching into August under the more \u2018realistic\u2019 case,\u201d writes Ed Mills, policy strategist at Raymond James.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills expects the $600 weekly payment to be cut to $300 or $400, and he said it\u2019s possible there would be more funds given to a Payroll Protection Program, to help small businesses.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOverall, momentum is building for the next package and the final price tag is arguably moving up (closer to $1.5 -2 trillion),\u201d Mills noted. Congress has already allocated $2.4 trillion in prior spending.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed will be discussing its own stimulus, and some economists expect it could again be talking about new tactics to keep interest rates low. One idea is a policy of forward guidance, where the Fed would steer market expectations more explicitly. Another is the Fed would use targeted Treasury purchases to control specific interest rates. But no new programs are expected to be announced.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey pretty much told us, they\u2019re all in. They told us they\u2019re willing to do whatever else it takes,\u201d said Keon. \u201cThe Fed is not going to be our problem. The Fed just told us they\u2019re going to do anything they can do to soften the blow from the virus.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/rshk3gVX/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/y6nsD6FQ/marketdata3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/nrVx3NtG/finvizfuts1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/NLhf0Rdn/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/gJmb01rb/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/vBhFxX6g/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Jn6YWFkq/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/85PX9Gjc/maketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/fRgk0Fb6/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C57tdKXj/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/HknGcQpj/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FsD5HPX2/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/Nfgvt3S6/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week\n\n&gt; The earnings slate continues to ramp up next week with 712 total companies scheduled to report. In the table below, we show the largest stocks by market cap that are set to report quarterly results. On Monday, there will be no company with a market cap above $100 billion reporting with the largest companies being Alexandria Real Estate (ARE) and multiple banks. On Tuesday, payment processor Visa (V) will be out with earnings in addition to Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN), McDonald's (MCD), and Raytheon (RTX). Visa has historically averaged the strongest stock price reaction to earnings of these names but it has gapped down for six straight quarters. That will be followed by another payment processor, Paypal (PYPL) on Wednesday. In addition to Paypal, Facebook (FB) is also scheduled to report that same day. While both stocks have averaged over 2% gains on earnings days historically, ServiceNow (NOW) has seen an even stronger performance with an average gain of 3.64%. Another major earnings report that will be widely watched is Boeing (BA) to get a gauge on how demolished travel demand has affected the company. On Thursday, three of the world's largest stocks will also be out with earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG). Each one has averaged a 1%+ gain on earnings days. Apple (AAPL) has seen some of the strongest results in recent history with last quarter snapping a streak of four consecutive triple plays. On Friday, two of the largest energy stocks, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), will round out the week and July's earning calendar. Both stocks have historically averaged declines on earnings days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/Earn3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dollar Weakness May Continue\n\n&gt; The US dollar was remarkably strong during the first quarter of 2020, benefitting from the flight to safety and rallying to nearly a 10% year-to-date gain at the stock market\u2019s low point on March 23. However, as equity markets have recovered, and the US has continued to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the dollar has given up nearly all of those gains. We think this trend may continue, and if so, it would have important implications for a range of asset classes.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a more diversified basket than the commonly cited DXY Index, is nearing a critical uptrend line. A break of this support could mean that weakness seen over the past few months is more than just an unwinding of the flight to safety. Through Wednesday, the index was down more than 1% for the week and tracking toward its fourth straight weekly loss.\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t just a technical story though. As we explored last month, rising twin deficits have historically been followed by a weaker dollar, meaning the fundamentals support this move as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/July-23-picture.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The commodity rally is another reason to believe the market may be looking toward a weaker dollar. Commodities are typically viewed as having an inverse relationship with the dollar since the dollar is effectively the denominator of a hard asset. Gold prices are up more than 20% year to date, copper just traded to its highest level in more than two years, and silver prices have appreciated 28% this month alone.\n\n&gt; As for the implications of a weaker dollar, according to LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201ca weaker US dollar may be a slight negative for US consumers\u2019 buying power, but for investors\u2019 portfolios the implications are overwhelmingly positive. Commodities are rallying, US multinational companies benefit from foreign buyers being able to afford more of their goods, and international stocks do well as their underlying currencies appreciate.\u201d\n\n&gt; Recent history bears this out. The last calendar year that saw a significant dollar decline was 2017 when the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell more than 8%. The S&amp;P 500 Index rallied more than 19% on a price return basis; however, international stocks fared even better. The MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 22% and 34%, respectively, and 2017 represented the only year since 2012 that either outperformed the US.\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Gets the Gold for YTD Performance\n\n&gt; In last night's Closer, we took a look at the massive rallies of late in the precious metals space. Gold (GLD) reached its highest level since 2011, but silver's (SLV) performance on the day was even more of a sight to behold with gains in the top 1% of all days since SLV began trading in 2006. Silver (SLV) rose 6.15% for its best day since March 24th when the metal rose 7.96%. Whereas the silver to gold ratio has been in a constant downtrend over the past decade (indicating underperformance of silver relative to gold), yesterday's big gains led to a breakout of this downtrend. With SLV trading higher by over 5% yet again this morning, that downtrend is being broken even more significantly, and that is even with SLV off the pre-market highs above $21.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; As recently as the final days of June, SLV was actually sitting on a loss year to date. That was a far cry from the performance of some of the best-performing assets of the year at the time like the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) which was up over 14% and the long term Treasuries ETF (TLT) which was up over 21.5%. Silver's yellow cousin, gold, was likewise sitting on a sizeable gain of 16.6%. Pivot ahead to today and the picture is very different. Around this morning's premarket highs when SLV was trading above $21, it actually topped QQQ, TLT, and GLD as the best performing asset in 2020. That is even with each of these other ETFs also trading higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys\n\n&gt; Despite persistent pandemic setbacks, bleak economic and corporate numbers, geopolitical tensions, civic unrest and a knock-down, drag-out election battle, the U.S. stock market has proven rather resilient. After suffering the shortest bear market in history that lasted only 40 days the velocity and strength of the V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low has been impressive.\n\n&gt; Massive fiscal stimulus, the return of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), vaccine promise and the boon of the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d economy have sent the market higher again here in July with NASDAQ tacking on new all-time highs, though the Dow and S&amp;P 500 continue to struggle. As of yesterday\u2019s close this put DJIA up 4.6%, S&amp;P 500 up 5.7% and NASDAQ up 6.4% for the month of July at yesterday\u2019s close, qualifying this as a \u201cHot July Market\u201d.\n\n&gt; Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by a late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of -7.2% on average (-4.7% median decline) in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year. The low in 2018 came a bit late, but it was just 2 days into winter. There were also prior lower prices in late October and November.\n\n&gt; Climbing COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths have forced rollbacks and pauses of economic reopening plans and travel restrictions. Coupled with an uptick in jobless claims and other troublesome economic readings and forecasts as well as elevated valuations, exuberant sentiment, technical resistance and seasonal weakness, stocks are ripe for a pullback. Today\u2019s selloff: case in point. This will likely set up a great buy as the $13+ trillion flows through the global economy into US stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8b02cd9a08b7fedd5996d544420d9cd8/cb70e70b199ba14d-04/s500x750/c8010183a653633c81747813512c8c74ed5214a2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$PYPL** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$APHA** \n&gt; * **$EBAY** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$RTX** \n&gt; * **$AZN** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$CNC** \n&gt; * **$MO** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$GOOG** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$GILD**\n&gt; * **$NOW** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$DXCM** \n&gt; * **$ABCB** \n&gt; * **$BUD** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$PINS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$WING** \n&gt; * **$LRCX**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/fRgk0Fb6/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/kg5BG97Q/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR MONDAY, JULY 27TH, 2020!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR2gdg5q/eram01.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8D2LRQ6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/C6Upp8Y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/O5wY9g7.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MjSLIaQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EictqLG.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XGrwuKt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HMjc0WJ.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/0hMH94x.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vFJ1WH4.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7otjSsD.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/7g6UICu.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FKHIibS.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/l21kL5q.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rrBxXn7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/X4senHx.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KqxX8LC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/3l48OVf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.31.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0VTb4f4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.31.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/here-comes-one-of-the-newsiest-and-most-critical-weeks-of-the-summer-for-markets.html)**\n*****\n&gt; In a summer of unending news, we may be heading into what could be the newsiest week of all.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq\u2019s sputtering rally could be put to its biggest test yet, as tech bellwether Apple and other stalwarts of the tech rally report earnings. Early in the week, Republicans will unveil their stimulus package proposal, which will then be debated as Friday\u2019s deadline nears for the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve also meets on and is likely to discuss other steps it can take. It\u2019s not likely, however, to make any moves as it wraps up on Wednesday, other than to assure markets it will continue to use extraordinary programs to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Then on Thursday, the government will release a big number many investors have been dreading \u2014 the first official reading of second quarter gross domestic product, which which should show how hard the economy crashed when it was abruptly shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a contraction of about 35% in the second quarter, followed by a bounce back in the third quarter. But the size of that comeback could be directly impacted by how much stimulus Congress gives the economy, and how much the coronavirus continues to impact businesses and economic activity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s a clear understanding of how much the economy has leaned on the crutch of government stimulus, both fiscally and monetarily,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cEveryone will be watching for what will replace the $600 a week, and that will be the most important component of whatever plan they come up with.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The $600 weekly payment to about 30 million unemployed Americans expires Friday, and it is unlikely Congress will have a plan before that date. Strategists expect the amount to be cut in half, and Boockvar said the amount of that payment will directly impact the size of the boost to the economy\n*****\n&gt; The stimulus and tech earnings could both be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat the package looks like will be a huge deal, particularly on the unemployment benefits side, and whether tech companies can exceed the bar,\u201d said Boockvar. \u201cThat\u2019s very hard for them right now. So if they miss, does that mean it\u2019s going to be a negative for tech and not the whole market? Are we going to keep rotating to value from growth because tech has been so dominant it could take everything down?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to decline by 40.3% for the second quarter, based on the results of companies that have already reported and estimates, according to Refinifiv\u2019s I/B/E/S. Technology earnings are expected to have one of the smallest profit declines, at just 4.4% on average.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, which had rallied to record highs this summer, ended lower for a second week, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings numbers overall, they\u2019ve been pretty good. It\u2019s just the basic problem with the stock market right now is that valuations are still pretty high,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cOther parts of the market that maybe look cheap on a price-to-book basis, their earnings have been hit. In the case of certain retailers, airlines, you have to worry about when their business is going to come back, if ever.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 80% of the companies already reporting have beaten Wall Street estimates. That is well above the average beat rate of about 65%, since 1994.\n*****\n&gt; Dozens of major companies report in the coming week, including Facebook on Wednesday and Alphabet and Amazon on Thursday. Pharmaceuticals Merck, Pfizer and Eli Lilly are expected to report, and consumer products names Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and Procter &amp; Gamble also release results. Big oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron report Friday.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus from Congress and the Fed\n&gt; Strategists expect Congress to ultimately adopt a new stimulus package of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, but after the GOP plan is introduced it will have to be squared with Democrats\u2019 proposals. The House has its own $3 trillion spending plan. It is unlikely an agreement can be approved before unemployment benefits expire Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBipartisan negotiations between the White House, House, and Senate are officially underway, but we expect brinkmanship before passage. Trump administration officials also diverge on their expectations on timing, which remains optimistically by the end of July, and possibly stretching into August under the more \u2018realistic\u2019 case,\u201d writes Ed Mills, policy strategist at Raymond James.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills expects the $600 weekly payment to be cut to $300 or $400, and he said it\u2019s possible there would be more funds given to a Payroll Protection Program, to help small businesses.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOverall, momentum is building for the next package and the final price tag is arguably moving up (closer to $1.5 -2 trillion),\u201d Mills noted. Congress has already allocated $2.4 trillion in prior spending.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed will be discussing its own stimulus, and some economists expect it could again be talking about new tactics to keep interest rates low. One idea is a policy of forward guidance, where the Fed would steer market expectations more explicitly. Another is the Fed would use targeted Treasury purchases to control specific interest rates. But no new programs are expected to be announced.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey pretty much told us, they\u2019re all in. They told us they\u2019re willing to do whatever else it takes,\u201d said Keon. \u201cThe Fed is not going to be our problem. The Fed just told us they\u2019re going to do anything they can do to soften the blow from the virus.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/rshk3gVX/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/y6nsD6FQ/marketdata3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/nrVx3NtG/finvizfuts1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/NLhf0Rdn/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/gJmb01rb/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/vBhFxX6g/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Jn6YWFkq/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/85PX9Gjc/maketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/fRgk0Fb6/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C57tdKXj/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/HknGcQpj/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FsD5HPX2/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/Nfgvt3S6/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week\n\n&gt; The earnings slate continues to ramp up next week with 712 total companies scheduled to report. In the table below, we show the largest stocks by market cap that are set to report quarterly results. On Monday, there will be no company with a market cap above $100 billion reporting with the largest companies being Alexandria Real Estate (ARE) and multiple banks. On Tuesday, payment processor Visa (V) will be out with earnings in addition to Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN), McDonald's (MCD), and Raytheon (RTX). Visa has historically averaged the strongest stock price reaction to earnings of these names but it has gapped down for six straight quarters. That will be followed by another payment processor, Paypal (PYPL) on Wednesday. In addition to Paypal, Facebook (FB) is also scheduled to report that same day. While both stocks have averaged over 2% gains on earnings days historically, ServiceNow (NOW) has seen an even stronger performance with an average gain of 3.64%. Another major earnings report that will be widely watched is Boeing (BA) to get a gauge on how demolished travel demand has affected the company. On Thursday, three of the world's largest stocks will also be out with earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG). Each one has averaged a 1%+ gain on earnings days. Apple (AAPL) has seen some of the strongest results in recent history with last quarter snapping a streak of four consecutive triple plays. On Friday, two of the largest energy stocks, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), will round out the week and July's earning calendar. Both stocks have historically averaged declines on earnings days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/Earn3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dollar Weakness May Continue\n\n&gt; The US dollar was remarkably strong during the first quarter of 2020, benefitting from the flight to safety and rallying to nearly a 10% year-to-date gain at the stock market\u2019s low point on March 23. However, as equity markets have recovered, and the US has continued to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the dollar has given up nearly all of those gains. We think this trend may continue, and if so, it would have important implications for a range of asset classes.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a more diversified basket than the commonly cited DXY Index, is nearing a critical uptrend line. A break of this support could mean that weakness seen over the past few months is more than just an unwinding of the flight to safety. Through Wednesday, the index was down more than 1% for the week and tracking toward its fourth straight weekly loss.\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t just a technical story though. As we explored last month, rising twin deficits have historically been followed by a weaker dollar, meaning the fundamentals support this move as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/July-23-picture.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The commodity rally is another reason to believe the market may be looking toward a weaker dollar. Commodities are typically viewed as having an inverse relationship with the dollar since the dollar is effectively the denominator of a hard asset. Gold prices are up more than 20% year to date, copper just traded to its highest level in more than two years, and silver prices have appreciated 28% this month alone.\n\n&gt; As for the implications of a weaker dollar, according to LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201ca weaker US dollar may be a slight negative for US consumers\u2019 buying power, but for investors\u2019 portfolios the implications are overwhelmingly positive. Commodities are rallying, US multinational companies benefit from foreign buyers being able to afford more of their goods, and international stocks do well as their underlying currencies appreciate.\u201d\n\n&gt; Recent history bears this out. The last calendar year that saw a significant dollar decline was 2017 when the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell more than 8%. The S&amp;P 500 Index rallied more than 19% on a price return basis; however, international stocks fared even better. The MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 22% and 34%, respectively, and 2017 represented the only year since 2012 that either outperformed the US.\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Gets the Gold for YTD Performance\n\n&gt; In last night's Closer, we took a look at the massive rallies of late in the precious metals space. Gold (GLD) reached its highest level since 2011, but silver's (SLV) performance on the day was even more of a sight to behold with gains in the top 1% of all days since SLV began trading in 2006. Silver (SLV) rose 6.15% for its best day since March 24th when the metal rose 7.96%. Whereas the silver to gold ratio has been in a constant downtrend over the past decade (indicating underperformance of silver relative to gold), yesterday's big gains led to a breakout of this downtrend. With SLV trading higher by over 5% yet again this morning, that downtrend is being broken even more significantly, and that is even with SLV off the pre-market highs above $21.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; As recently as the final days of June, SLV was actually sitting on a loss year to date. That was a far cry from the performance of some of the best-performing assets of the year at the time like the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) which was up over 14% and the long term Treasuries ETF (TLT) which was up over 21.5%. Silver's yellow cousin, gold, was likewise sitting on a sizeable gain of 16.6%. Pivot ahead to today and the picture is very different. Around this morning's premarket highs when SLV was trading above $21, it actually topped QQQ, TLT, and GLD as the best performing asset in 2020. That is even with each of these other ETFs also trading higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys\n\n&gt; Despite persistent pandemic setbacks, bleak economic and corporate numbers, geopolitical tensions, civic unrest and a knock-down, drag-out election battle, the U.S. stock market has proven rather resilient. After suffering the shortest bear market in history that lasted only 40 days the velocity and strength of the V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low has been impressive.\n\n&gt; Massive fiscal stimulus, the return of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), vaccine promise and the boon of the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d economy have sent the market higher again here in July with NASDAQ tacking on new all-time highs, though the Dow and S&amp;P 500 continue to struggle. As of yesterday\u2019s close this put DJIA up 4.6%, S&amp;P 500 up 5.7% and NASDAQ up 6.4% for the month of July at yesterday\u2019s close, qualifying this as a \u201cHot July Market\u201d.\n\n&gt; Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by a late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of -7.2% on average (-4.7% median decline) in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year. The low in 2018 came a bit late, but it was just 2 days into winter. There were also prior lower prices in late October and November.\n\n&gt; Climbing COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths have forced rollbacks and pauses of economic reopening plans and travel restrictions. Coupled with an uptick in jobless claims and other troublesome economic readings and forecasts as well as elevated valuations, exuberant sentiment, technical resistance and seasonal weakness, stocks are ripe for a pullback. Today\u2019s selloff: case in point.

The money is in a Roth IRA at Fidelity. I have no idea what the money is currently invested in, how much is in buying power, and so on. I have a basic idea of how I want to manage the money, but I\u2019m looking for some insight on if I\u2019m in the right ballpark here and if so, how I could better execute my strategy. \n\nFor starters, I\u2019m probably going to sell everything, unless any of it overlaps with the ideas I\u2019m going to lay out in this post.\n\nFrom there, I want to invest half of the funds in dividend and value stocks, and index funds. \n\nI\u2019m thinking at least a quarter of that half, so an eighth of my entire portfolio spread across the three main US indexes, specifically invested in SPY, DOW, and QQQ. I\u2019m interested in investing either the QQQ or SPY portion in a 3x daily bull fund that traces that fund, specifically either TQQQ or SPXL, let me know what you think about that.\n\nThe next eighth I\u2019m wanting to invest into banks. Companies like JPM and C are underperforming the market so heavily right now, and they\u2019ve already confirmed that they\u2019re not cutting dividends. Yes, share buybacks are suspended pending future earnings requirements but I believe that JPM and C are well positioned enough to resume buybacks at the latest by the end of Q1 2021. I genuinely believe that banks are discounted right now and have potential for a great return if they return to their ATH\u2019s. I also like the prospect of their dividend income over time. \n\nThe next eighth I\u2019m wanting to put into funds specifically for their dividends. I don\u2019t really care about the YoY return on these tickers; I\u2019m just interested in the dividend. I\u2019d want to spread it across SPHD, MO, KO, ABBV, SPG, and VYM. \n\nAny suggestions for the last eighth of the long-term / low-risk portion of the fund would be appreciated. I\u2019m sure I couldn\u2019t go wrong with just going heavy on the dividend funds, but yeah, any suggestions would be cool.\n\nNow for the second half of the fund. I\u2019m wanting to approach this half with a more high-risk, high-reward strategy. \n\nFor the first half of this high-risk high-reward portion (quarter of my total portfolio), I\u2019m just going to invest in growth stocks/ETFs. A couple of tickers I have in mind are ARKK, SOCL, SMH, AMD, FSLY, TSLA, APPL, MSFT, FB, and AMZN.\n\nFor last quarter, I\u2019m not thinking YOLO on an FD type high risk high reward, but I\u2019d definitely like to dabble in options. And this is the portion of my investment that I\u2019m most open to suggestions and ideas. I have some basic ideas though. \n\nMy 1st idea is to keep a quarter of the portfolio in cash and sell cash secured puts on companies that I actually wouldn\u2019t mind buying 100 shares of at the strike. I\u2019d want to continually do this up until the day I inevitably get assigned and then actually purchase those shares. A couple of tickers that I have in mind for playing like this are SNAP and NCLH, (yeah cruise line RH meme stock I know). At which point I\u2019d acquire the shares and then sell covered calls on the shares on the way up, just to reap in additional benefits, again, not minding if I get assigned and have to sell them for that strike. I kind of like this idea the best out of any that I\u2019ve had, just because it seems like the lowest risk, I\u2019d be able to acquire 100 shares of a company that I see growth in, which would probably be the smartest long term play anyways. \n\nMy 2nd idea is to buy LEAPS on banks, specifically JPM or C. I\u2019d just buy calls within +5% of the strike and buy the furthest dated out possible. Simple yeah but I think getting a play with that much time and that much potential delta is a good idea, and its relatively low risk compared to my last idea.\n\nMy last idea is definitely the riskiest and basically, it\u2019s just buying calls for cruises and airlines for June of next year. A potential vaccine announcement, stimulus in the form of travel expense related tax write-offs, as well as the incoming wave of cabin-fever induced travel frenzy are all factors that could honestly cause them to pop-off at any time within the next year. \n\nTLDR;\n\nI\u2019m a 22-year-old inheriting somewhere between $25,000-$30,000 this week and I want to manage the money myself. I\u2019m pretending that each 8\u2019th is about $3,000 to be conservative. My general idea is this:\n\nLong-term, low risk: \n\n1/8 \u2013 US indices, specifically SPY, DOW, and QQQ. Let me know what you think about putting either the SPY or QQQ portion into SPXL or TQQQ.\n\n1/8 \u2013 Banks, probably literally just JPM and C, maybe a little bit of WFC but they suck. \n\n1/8 \u2013 Dividend stocks, specifically SPHD, MO, KO, ABBV, SPG, and VYM. \n\n1/8 \u2013 Want to allocate to a low-risk, long-term strategy and would like suggestions on what to allocate this to. \n\nHigher risk, higher reward:\n\n1/4 \u2013 High growth stocks and ETF\u2019s, specifically ARKK, SOCL, SMH, AMD, FSLY, TSLA, APPL, MSFT, FB, and AMZN. \n\n1/4 \u2013 Three different ideas. 1.

The money is in a Roth IRA at Fidelity. I have no idea what the money is currently invested in, how much is in buying power, and so on. I have a basic idea of how I want to manage the money, but I\u2019m looking for some insight on if I\u2019m in the right ballpark here and if so, how I could better execute my strategy. \n\nFor starters, I\u2019m probably going to sell everything, unless any of it overlaps with the ideas I\u2019m going to lay out in this post.\n\nFrom there, I want to invest half of the funds in dividend and value stocks, and index funds. \n\nI\u2019m thinking at least a quarter of that half, so an eighth of my entire portfolio spread across the three main US indexes, specifically invested in SPY, DOW, and QQQ. I\u2019m interested in investing either the QQQ or SPY portion in a 3x daily bull fund that traces that fund, specifically either TQQQ or SPXL, let me know what you think about that.\n\nThe next eighth I\u2019m wanting to invest into banks. Companies like JPM and C are underperforming the market so heavily right now, and they\u2019ve already confirmed that they\u2019re not cutting dividends. Yes, share buybacks are suspended pending future earnings requirements but I believe that JPM and C are well positioned enough to resume buybacks at the latest by the end of Q1 2021. I genuinely believe that banks are discounted right now and have potential for a great return if they return to their ATH\u2019s. I also like the prospect of their dividend income over time. \n\nThe next eighth I\u2019m wanting to put into funds specifically for their dividends. I don\u2019t really care about the YoY return on these tickers; I\u2019m just interested in the dividend. I\u2019d want to spread it across SPHD, MO, KO, ABBV, SPG, and VYM. \n\nAny suggestions for the last eighth of the long-term / low-risk portion of the fund would be appreciated. I\u2019m sure I couldn\u2019t go wrong with just going heavy on the dividend funds, but yeah, any suggestions would be cool.\n\nNow for the second half of the fund. I\u2019m wanting to approach this half with a more high-risk, high-reward strategy. \n\nFor the first half of this high-risk high-reward portion (quarter of my total portfolio), I\u2019m just going to invest in growth stocks/ETFs. A couple of tickers I have in mind are ARKK, SOCL, SMH, AMD, FSLY, TSLA, APPL, MSFT, FB, and AMZN.\n\nFor last quarter, I\u2019m not thinking YOLO on an FD type high risk high reward, but I\u2019d definitely like to dabble in options. And this is the portion of my investment that I\u2019m most open to suggestions and ideas. I have some basic ideas though. \n\nMy 1st idea is to keep a quarter of the portfolio in cash and sell cash secured puts on companies that I actually wouldn\u2019t mind buying 100 shares of at the strike. I\u2019d want to continually do this up until the day I inevitably get assigned and then actually purchase those shares. A couple of tickers that I have in mind for playing like this are SNAP and NCLH, (yeah cruise line RH meme stock I know). At which point I\u2019d acquire the shares and then sell covered calls on the shares on the way up, just to reap in additional benefits, again, not minding if I get assigned and have to sell them for that strike. I kind of like this idea the best out of any that I\u2019ve had, just because it seems like the lowest risk, I\u2019d be able to acquire 100 shares of a company that I see growth in, which would probably be the smartest long term play anyways. \n\nMy 2nd idea is to buy LEAPS on banks, specifically JPM or C. I\u2019d just buy calls within +5% of the strike and buy the furthest dated out possible. Simple yeah but I think getting a play with that much time and that much potential delta is a good idea, and its relatively low risk compared to my last idea.\n\nMy last idea is definitely the riskiest and basically, it\u2019s just buying calls for cruises and airlines for June of next year. A potential vaccine announcement, stimulus in the form of travel expense related tax write-offs, as well as the incoming wave of cabin-fever induced travel frenzy are all factors that could honestly cause them to pop-off at any time within the next year. \n\nTLDR;\n\nI\u2019m a 22-year-old inheriting somewhere between $25,000-$30,000 this week and I want to manage the money myself. I\u2019m pretending that each 8\u2019th is about $3,000 to be conservative. My general idea is this:\n\nLong-term, low risk: \n\n1/8 \u2013 US indices, specifically SPY, DOW, and QQQ. Let me know what you think about putting either the SPY or QQQ portion into SPXL or TQQQ.\n\n1/8 \u2013 Banks, probably literally just JPM and C, maybe a little bit of WFC but they suck. \n\n1/8 \u2013 Dividend stocks, specifically SPHD, MO, KO, ABBV, SPG, and VYM. \n\n1/8 \u2013 Want to allocate to a low-risk, long-term strategy and would like suggestions on what to allocate this to. \n\nHigher risk, higher reward:\n\n1/4 \u2013 High growth stocks and ETF\u2019s, specifically ARKK, SOCL, SMH, AMD, FSLY, TSLA, APPL, MSFT, FB, and AMZN. \n\n1/4 \u2013 Three different ideas. 1. Sell cash secured puts on SNAP and NCLH until I get assigned, at which point hold the shares and sell covered calls. 2. LEAPS on banks. 3. LEAPS on travel. \n\nOpen to suggestions, advice, criticism, anything. Any input at all is appreciated.

I want to change that moving forward. I cannot shorten my list of around 50-60 stocks that I find promising. These are mainly the popular stocks in tech, health and social like Amazon, Apple, FB, MSFT, NOW, NVDA, AMD, SE, LOW, TTD, DOCU, NFLX, PINS, TSLA, NET, SHOP, FSLY, PFE, LVGO, BMY and some beaten down stocks like ULTA, SPG, STWD, WYNN, LVS, MAR, DAL, LUV, CAR. I'm also interested in the ARK ETFs and QQQ, WCLD, CIBR etc.\n\nBecause I've been unable to narrow this list to 10-12 stocks that I can invest $450K (20% cash) and keep adding on dips, yeah my bad I'm just not able to decide.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I have read about the importance of diversification and DCA'ing, and over the last few months have been contributing a healthy amount to whats grown into a 38 stock portfolio. I really have no desire to keep tabs on all of these and would much rather contribute to a low expense index fund(s). But I guess I'm afraid of having future FOMO by selling my current positions and potentially lose out on any massive gains an index fund might not yield me. For one reason or another I see most of my positions as relatively \"safe\" and not a bunch of penny meme stocks. \n\nI don't really know what to do and I'm looking for some advice. Should I stop contributing to this portfolio and \"let it ride\", and put all future monies into a new portfolio with only index funds?

I have read about the importance of diversification and DCA'ing, and over the last few months have been contributing a healthy amount to whats grown into a 38 stock portfolio. I really have no desire to keep tabs on all of these and would much rather contribute to a low expense index fund(s).

For one reason or another I see most of my positions as relatively \"safe\" and not a bunch of penny meme stocks. \n\nI don't really know what to do and I'm looking for some advice. Should I stop contributing to this portfolio and \"let it ride\", and put all future monies into a new portfolio with only index funds?

Debt and leverage globally absolutely DWARF the 2008 problems surrounding CDO's. You think there was a little corruption and clever lending in America's banking system? Imagine what goes on in the rest of the world\n3. Pretend Covid-19 doesn't exist. The \"crash\" in Feb/March was coming no matter what. Governments, corporations, banks all knew it was inevitable and that there is chaos in the financial system. Let's just operate under that assumption.\n4. Think of right now as being the 2008 housing crisis, but instead of houses in America it's COMPANIES IN THE WORLD (hint: its a lot bigger problem)\n5. First Crash was a liquidity crisis. Nobody had enough cash on their balance sheet to hand over to the people they owed. Think of it like when you don't pay rent. Your landlord might be financially able to take the hit, but he really doesn't want to sell his Tesla stock to pay HIS landlord and so on and so on until the entire financial system seizes up. (psst that's why it's called \"liquidity\")\n6. The fed and central banks came to the rescue the only ways they are legally allowed to. Now that's taken care of and everyone is rife with liquidity to keep the system turning. Today, we are entering a SOLVENCY CRISIS.\n\n**Part 1 - What the Fed is REALLY doing**\n\nNow... let me enlighten you for a second... THE FED DOESN'T \u2018BUY STOCKS\u2019. Well, at least not directly. If you remember one thing about the fed, remember - they are bound by RULES. They MUST keep a balance sheet like any other bank. And the money they \"print\" cannot enter the market the same way your paycheck buys condoms for your wife's boyfriend. It's there to sit on the other side of the balance sheet of BANKS or the TREASURY who can then lend \"real\" money into the economy. There's no money that gets \"out\" - It's all \"loaned\" unless it comes from \"stimulus\" which still goes through Congress and the Treasury. More on that later.\n\n**THE POINT IS THERE'S ALWAYS AT LEAST ONE MIDDLE MAN. THIS IS MASSIVELY IMPORTANT LATER!!!**\n\nHere is the breakdown of the steps the fed MUST take when conducting those \"Open Market Operations\" we've all heard about.\n\n**1. When the Fed buys government securities through securities dealers in the bond market, it deposits the payment into the bank accounts of the banks, businesses, and individuals who sold the securities.**\n\n**2. Those deposits become part of the funds commercial banks hold at the Federal Reserve and thus part of the funds commercial banks have available to lend.**\n\n**3. Because banks want to lend money, to attract borrowers they decrease interest rates, including the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans (the federal funds rate).**\n\nSee? The fed only provides \"money\" to institutions they are legally allowed to give money to (Treasury and banks). For simplicity's sake just think of JPow going into his computer and typing in a few zeroes on JP Morgan\u2019s Computer. Doesn't matter. The fed's hands are tied and they can only control rates and print money. Oh by the way... The Fed lowered banks' fractional reserve requirement to ZERO in March. **That means banks don't have to have ANY money in the vault.** Make of this what you will.\n\n**Part 2 - Why Stimulus is Different than printed liquidity**\n\nSo now we hopefully understand where the new printing is going and how it gets there. It's going to anyone who needs a little bump to their cash pile in order to fulfill their existing debt obligations **ONLY TO KEEP THE SYSTEM WORKING.** No more, no less. Fed prints $ and banks give loans. Fed prints $ and Treasury writes checks. **NOBODY** ***WANTS*** **TO DO THIS**\n\nRead this whole article if you want, but I'll pull out what matters.\n\n[The Great Leverage Unwind](https://www.guggenheiminvestments.com/perspectives/global-cio-outlook/the-great-leverage-unwind) \\- **March 22 Before the Stimulus!!**\n\n*\"In order to get a foundation under the markets, we\u2019re going to need something very large, something in the $2 trillion range in the form of a pool of liquidity that can be made quickly available to businesses and corporations that need it, along with the financing facilities of $2 trillion\u2013$4 trillion from the Fed.\"*\n\n**\"Liquidity that can be made quickly available\" = YOUR STIMULUS BABY**\n\n**When it comes to getting fed money to individual companies WE are that middle man I mentioned earlier.

Only way this can be fixed is by the measures we see being taken during Covid. Retail has been MANIPULATED AND REQUIRED to perform the functions the Fed cannot(buying individual stocks). This has led to billionaires and institutions leaving retail holding the bag. It\u2019s going to follow a bursting bubble pattern. Nobody is left to prop up the markets nor do they want to because the leverage has to unwind. Dollar might surge like last time and collapse (milkshake theory).\n\nAddition: Futures being green headed into an open just means we open higher for everyone to get a chance to dump. If you were a fund manager would you want the market to open green and THEN sell? Or sit and wait around all day for a sell price you might not get? Remember it\u2019s all about manipulating retail. The \u201cbounce\u201d you figure is coming already happened overnight. Or there was selling overnight and the bounce is coming at the open. Look at the /ES charts and the market hour charts.

I don't post much so please excuse the poor formatting and multi-topic post. I plan to post this across a few subreddits. \n\n# I am writing to you guys today because I don't have anyone to give me sound advice. I would like you to review my current position and future trajectory in life. Help me set myself up for financial independence, freedom and hopefully an upper echelon in society. This isn't your traditional financial post. I could probably use  advice in more than one aspect of my life. \n\nTLDR; Weak family beginnings. Abusive absent father, decaying mother. Ambitious son (me) overcame a childhood of loneliness and hardship. I am more mature, responsible and ambitious than everyone else I know at my age group. I feel like I deserve more than I currently have and I need to continue pushing myself to get there to the point I am becoming greedy and frugal.  Skip **Backstory** and go straight to **current living conditions/spending** if you don't care for the long read.\n\n***Backstory:*** \n\nOur Family is weak and unorganized. My dead grandmother died of cancer at 65. She had my mother, aunt and uncle from age 14-16 with my Greek grandfather who was 21 or 22 at the time and left back to Greece. leaving her in Ontario with 3 children. With no education and being a teen mom did not set the next generation up well for the future.\n\nWhen my mother was young she was very smart and did well in elementary and high school,I'm lucky to have a kind mother. My grandmother kicked out  her 3 kids at 18 so she could enjoy the rest of her youth. \n\nThey lived together and all worked 2 jobs to survive. My aunt was a stripper and my mom was a waitress at the same club. I'm not too sure about my uncle. My mom was groped by a drunk patron and the manager did nothing so she quit.\n\nEventually ending up at a good job involving computers in the floppy disc ages at a large company. IT or data entry maybe?  I don't know anything between that time gap, but it's several years. \n\nMy mom met my dad at some company baseball game.  \n\nLittle did she know what a piece of shit he was. He knocked her up and came and went as he pleased, mooching off her for her car, food, condo all which she achieved on her own. I'm assuming my mom was desperate for affection and stability not being close to our grandma and having no dad.\n\nFew years later my sister was born. My dad convinced my mother he wanted to settle down and get married (they didn't). Told her to sell her condo and he would sell his parents house that 6 of his family were living in\u2026 idk how she believed that. As soon as her condo sold he said he wasn't able to sell his house.\n\nWhile my mom was pregnant with my sister she was getting severe stomach pain and colon pain. The doctors brushed it off as pregnancy related pain and said it was normal.\n\nTruth was she had terrible terrible colon cancer and it was bad. My mom doesn't like to talk about her health but she is scarred everywhere from c-sections and surgeries. They caught the cancer late after she gave birth to my sister. My mom had several intense surgeries, not going very smoothly. She has plastic tubing for a colon and osteomy bag, poor circulation.\n\nMy father emptied her bank accounts and stole her car while watching us. Let my RESP payments laps and I ended up losing mine.  (maybe the money is still out there somewhere, my mom says it's gone). When she got out of the hospital she was like 90 pounds and in a wheelchair. Still battling cancer in her late 20\u2019s. My Dad got fed up of looking after us solely and said \u201cthings like its been 2 months since you gave birth when the fuck are you getting out of that chair and going to watch the children?\u201d All this time my mom is on her own. Poor relationships with her mother, sister and brother and she is the smart and responsible one out of the bunch.\n\nShe has benefits at work and is on disability, bought a new house and is raising us alone.Its a good thing she was able to get a mortgage and LOC and credit cards before going on disability, playing off her sickness.\n\nIn and out of court with my dad fighting for child support and sole custody, there is a court order he can pick us up and drop us off every second weekend. They probably hired lawyers and went to court on several occasions. My father has a job with Canada Post, a decent job.\n\nYears go by, my mom is slowly recovering from eating healthy and doing light exercise. My dad convinces her he wants to be in his young kids lives and he made so many mistakes with us and her and that he loves her. She sells her house and buys a bigger house ( the current house we have lived in for 18 years) It doesn't work out, he hasn't changed, she finally learns and realizes and he is gone for good. Several court battles later claiming she is alienating and abusing us from the father. Throwing money at my mom with crooked family lawyers stirring the pot on both sides (several of her own lawyers fucked her). Our whole childhood was robbed with a stressed out overworked sick mother, abusive father towards me and my sister, emotional physical and slight sexual towards my sister.\n\nYears of scraping along and bad lawyers dragging things out ruined my mom. So much stress and no support. She doesn't sleep well and doesn't eat well, it's broken her. I've tried to ask about her health and her finances but she is a private introvert and says it's none of my business. She has been suffering from depression for many years, she tells me she has MS. She is tired all the time, she can't control her emotions. She has a hearing and sight issue. She has poor communication skills and emotional intelligence. I think me and her might be somewhere on the spectrum. At a first glance you wouldn't be able to tell these things about her. Besides her talking very loud all the time not realizing how much louder she is talking than those speaking to her. I could be wrong about myself as well and it may just be that I was poorly socialized as a kid.\n\nI started working at a grocery store at 12 or 13 years old and I have had 1 or 2 jobs at a time since. My mom couldn't afford to give me an allowance, if i needed money i had to work for it.. My mom needed to give the manager of a grocery store a signed letter saying it was legal for him to be hiring me. Growing up I knew not to ask for things from the store, or say what things I liked or wished I had. I remember teaching my little sister the same, constantly telling her we didn't have money for that or it was a waste of money.\n\nI feel emotionless from all the weed I smoked growing up. I was high on marijuana more than I was sober from 14-21 minus the year and a half break I took while aggressively losing weight and doing lots of cardio and weights. 13-17 I got really fat sitting and playing video games eating unhealthy and smoking. I don't get angry, I don't get scared. I am confident in the fact that I don't care what many people think and I don't have time for their laziness or bullshit. My former introverted shy self is gone, but any happiness I feel is short lived and quickly fleeting. I've been depressed for so long  it just feels normal. What keeps me going is my will to finally live financially free and explore what life has to offer, I hope I still have passion when that is all said and done. I want to make a woman happy and to feel wanted and lusted over. I want to pass on a hard work ethic, reason, wisdom, problem solving skills and a financial fortune to a child.\n\nI am not that close with my sister or my mom. Our crucial years of growing together were all ruined. And now I feel like my mom has been poisoned into being toxic by being mistreated and her decaying health.\n\nShe started taking out her misery on me when I was an older teenager. The court battles were not over. Skipping school and becoming careless I just wanted to get away from it all, my slipping grades and poor attendance were ammunition for my dad against her. Him paying child support was conditional that i was a student and a dependent, he owed her thousands towards my sisters schooling costs and retroactive child support. My sister and myself are extremely intelligent. I am more of a hands-on learner. My sister is quite the academic. She is multilingual and  was enrolled in a french immersion private school from grades 6-8. Doing accelerated classes. Paid for by a family friend of my moms from her old company. He is somewhat like a grandfather towards us. She has also completed 2 or 3 university and college programs. Her latest program was supposed to be linked with an employment or intern position in communications and human resources but COVID-19 fucked that all up.\n\nI hung out with anyone who would put up with me\u2026 I didn't know how to socialize, I ate food that made me feel good, I smoked weed constantly and I played video games. Video Games saved me from the bad influences I was hanging out with (kids doing hard drugs, selling drugs, getting into fights). Video games was the one thing I was good at, that I could show the world I had skill in something. I played competitive games, that's all I cared about.   I was gaining a lot of weight in my teenage years, which still affects my physique today. I can gain fat back extremely quickly even though I managed to get into good shape and quit smoking weed for a  year and a half. No father and living with 2 women while being an introvert and a loner, did not help me with women. I was happy to lose my virginity at 18 after getting hard into the gym and getting into shape to some yolo party chick. RIP so many missed sexual advances growing up. Thankfully I had blonde hair and green eyes and nice features before I started gaining weight and eventually losing my hair. Probably a mix between starving myself to  lose weight fast and poor nutrition, high stress and wearing a lot of hats growing up. Falling in and out of the gym after 20 and being in relationships with some poorly selected ladies I started smoking a lot of weed again, putting back on the weight and getting weak. \n\nFound someone willing to pay me for Working construction. And I got a side job as a server. I was able to save up 40k cash. I ended up giving it to my mom for rent for the next few years. Construction was 6AM-6PM 7 days a week cash. And i would work a few hours after that at a restaurant.  This was not sustainable. I ended up getting really stressed out and went back into living in my room playing video games with my rent taken care of. (i really wish i had invested that money and found a new job) \n\nThis is getting too long, and I apologize for the scattered wall of text. This is the first time I've opened up to anyone at such a length and detail.\n\nWith hard work and bullshitting I was able to secure a good city job, getting my CPR and AED first aid and DZ commercial license. I plan to pursue a horticultural degree and become a gardener at the city, that will pay around 33$ with the ability to run a crew and get lead hand 36$/hr. Possibly a real estate license and a course in finance/economics down the road. Currently looking for SAT/SUN work as an arborist, that fell through since covid.\n\nI am ambitious. My ambition is why I choose to live. I want a physique people drool over, I want Fuck you money i can treat myself and family to stuff. I want my dad to know how successful I've become on my own. That we made the right choice without him. I want to say a big fuck you to everyone who ever doubted me or bullied me growing up. I want to FIRE. I want social status and power. I fear I want more than I can achieve and I want to do anything to get it. I feel like I'm running out of time and I'm going to blink and be 30 years old and aging without a woman that loves me and without friends or a plan. I want a good night's sleep without my brain keeping me awake with a will to learn and make more money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Current Living situation and Spending:***\n\n**I am a** **26/M Living in Ontario Canada, just north of Toronto (Richmond Hill)**. \n\n**I Live at home with my single mother(54) and younger sister(23).HCOL area.**\n\n**I have no debt.**\n\n**I have a credit rating of 840/900.**\n\nI have a job working for my municipality full time as a parks operator 3rd class. **$29.11/hr 1.5% annual raise**, winter months provide the ability to plow streets and sidewalks for overtime/double time plus oncall pay.

I don't post much so please excuse the poor formatting and multi-topic post. I plan to post this across a few subreddits. \n\n# I am writing to you guys today because I don't have anyone to give me sound advice. I would like you to review my current position and future trajectory in life. Help me set myself up for financial independence, freedom and hopefully an upper echelon in society. This isn't your traditional financial post. I could probably use  advice in more than one aspect of my life. \n\nTLDR; Weak family beginnings. Abusive absent father, decaying mother. Ambitious son (me) overcame a childhood of loneliness and hardship. I am more mature, responsible and ambitious than everyone else I know at my age group. I feel like I deserve more than I currently have and I need to continue pushing myself to get there to the point I am becoming greedy and frugal.  Skip **Backstory** and go straight to **current living conditions/spending** if you don't care for the long read.\n\n***Backstory:*** \n\nOur Family is weak and unorganized. My dead grandmother died of cancer at 65. She had my mother, aunt and uncle from age 14-16 with my Greek grandfather who was 21 or 22 at the time and left back to Greece. leaving her in Ontario with 3 children. With no education and being a teen mom did not set the next generation up well for the future.\n\nWhen my mother was young she was very smart and did well in elementary and high school,I'm lucky to have a kind mother. My grandmother kicked out  her 3 kids at 18 so she could enjoy the rest of her youth. \n\nThey lived together and all worked 2 jobs to survive. My aunt was a stripper and my mom was a waitress at the same club. I'm not too sure about my uncle. My mom was groped by a drunk patron and the manager did nothing so she quit.\n\nEventually ending up at a good job involving computers in the floppy disc ages at a large company. IT or data entry maybe?  I don't know anything between that time gap, but it's several years. \n\nMy mom met my dad at some company baseball game.  \n\nLittle did she know what a piece of shit he was. He knocked her up and came and went as he pleased, mooching off her for her car, food, condo all which she achieved on her own. I'm assuming my mom was desperate for affection and stability not being close to our grandma and having no dad.\n\nFew years later my sister was born. My dad convinced my mother he wanted to settle down and get married (they didn't). Told her to sell her condo and he would sell his parents house that 6 of his family were living in\u2026 idk how she believed that. As soon as her condo sold he said he wasn't able to sell his house.\n\nWhile my mom was pregnant with my sister she was getting severe stomach pain and colon pain. The doctors brushed it off as pregnancy related pain and said it was normal.\n\nTruth was she had terrible terrible colon cancer and it was bad. My mom doesn't like to talk about her health but she is scarred everywhere from c-sections and surgeries. They caught the cancer late after she gave birth to my sister. My mom had several intense surgeries, not going very smoothly. She has plastic tubing for a colon and osteomy bag, poor circulation.\n\nMy father emptied her bank accounts and stole her car while watching us. Let my RESP payments laps and I ended up losing mine.  (maybe the money is still out there somewhere, my mom says it's gone). When she got out of the hospital she was like 90 pounds and in a wheelchair. Still battling cancer in her late 20\u2019s. My Dad got fed up of looking after us solely and said \u201cthings like its been 2 months since you gave birth when the fuck are you getting out of that chair and going to watch the children?\u201d All this time my mom is on her own. Poor relationships with her mother, sister and brother and she is the smart and responsible one out of the bunch.\n\nShe has benefits at work and is on disability, bought a new house and is raising us alone.Its a good thing she was able to get a mortgage and LOC and credit cards before going on disability, playing off her sickness.\n\nIn and out of court with my dad fighting for child support and sole custody, there is a court order he can pick us up and drop us off every second weekend. They probably hired lawyers and went to court on several occasions. My father has a job with Canada Post, a decent job.\n\nYears go by, my mom is slowly recovering from eating healthy and doing light exercise. My dad convinces her he wants to be in his young kids lives and he made so many mistakes with us and her and that he loves her. She sells her house and buys a bigger house ( the current house we have lived in for 18 years) It doesn't work out, he hasn't changed, she finally learns and realizes and he is gone for good. Several court battles later claiming she is alienating and abusing us from the father. Throwing money at my mom with crooked family lawyers stirring the pot on both sides (several of her own lawyers fucked her). Our whole childhood was robbed with a stressed out overworked sick mother, abusive father towards me and my sister, emotional physical and slight sexual towards my sister.\n\nYears of scraping along and bad lawyers dragging things out ruined my mom. So much stress and no support. She doesn't sleep well and doesn't eat well, it's broken her. I've tried to ask about her health and her finances but she is a private introvert and says it's none of my business. She has been suffering from depression for many years, she tells me she has MS. She is tired all the time, she can't control her emotions. She has a hearing and sight issue. She has poor communication skills and emotional intelligence. I think me and her might be somewhere on the spectrum. At a first glance you wouldn't be able to tell these things about her. Besides her talking very loud all the time not realizing how much louder she is talking than those speaking to her. I could be wrong about myself as well and it may just be that I was poorly socialized as a kid.\n\nI started working at a grocery store at 12 or 13 years old and I have had 1 or 2 jobs at a time since. My mom couldn't afford to give me an allowance, if i needed money i had to work for it.. My mom needed to give the manager of a grocery store a signed letter saying it was legal for him to be hiring me. Growing up I knew not to ask for things from the store, or say what things I liked or wished I had. I remember teaching my little sister the same, constantly telling her we didn't have money for that or it was a waste of money.\n\nI feel emotionless from all the weed I smoked growing up. I was high on marijuana more than I was sober from 14-21 minus the year and a half break I took while aggressively losing weight and doing lots of cardio and weights. 13-17 I got really fat sitting and playing video games eating unhealthy and smoking. I don't get angry, I don't get scared. I am confident in the fact that I don't care what many people think and I don't have time for their laziness or bullshit. My former introverted shy self is gone, but any happiness I feel is short lived and quickly fleeting. I've been depressed for so long  it just feels normal. What keeps me going is my will to finally live financially free and explore what life has to offer, I hope I still have passion when that is all said and done. I want to make a woman happy and to feel wanted and lusted over. I want to pass on a hard work ethic, reason, wisdom, problem solving skills and a financial fortune to a child.\n\nI am not that close with my sister or my mom. Our crucial years of growing together were all ruined. And now I feel like my mom has been poisoned into being toxic by being mistreated and her decaying health.\n\nShe started taking out her misery on me when I was an older teenager.

This, on top of its rapidly growing developer platform, is consequential for many reasons as a market-mover in the industry.`\n\n`# In Short`\n\n`CloudFlare so far has been shredding forward across multiple technical markets competing against by:`\n\n`- Competing marketshare against CISCO, Palo Alto Networks, and other hardware customers`\n\n`- Offering a way to not lock your organization into a big tech vendor`\n\n`- Promoting security and challenging Big Tech's direction with web development`\n\n`- Forming positive relationships with Shopify, Facebook, JD, Twitter, Baidu, TOR, and Microsoft`\n\n`- Pioneering the ease-of-use privacy movement with` [`1.1.1.1`](https://1.1.1.1/) `and distributing VPNs.`\n\n`- Growing a rapid, robust, cost-effective, and secure network across the world`\n\n`- _Providing a development platform that promotes the use extremely powerful and 'cutting edge' web computing._ **-&gt; YOU ARE HERE**`\n\n`- Creating a better internet.`\n\n`_**Cofounder of NPM - a primary pioneer in the cloud market**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951310-7164c400-a7e5-11ea-8675-e265e7c15336.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951310-7164c400-a7e5-11ea-8675-e265e7c15336.png)`)`\n\n`# The Thesis`\n\n`The economic value and convergence between e-commerce, global networking speeds, and video advancements is not anywhere close to realized. There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall economic development cycle. This timeframe has been accelerated greatly due to global market lockdowns and further risk of lockdown.`\n\n`Physical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world. Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950869-9c99e400-a7e2-11ea-8373-3e6f2b42b4bc.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950869-9c99e400-a7e2-11ea-8373-3e6f2b42b4bc.png)`)`\n\n`Infrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates. This market is **BIG** and no one or two players will be large enough to capture the market. It ranges from manufacturers, energy departments, web products, hospitals, governments, and so on. Security is serviced differently based on the industry. This much is obvious - a hospital will clearly protect patient records more closely than a manufacturer controlling the runtime of their high-speed machining assembly line.`\n\n`_**ZScaler servicing manufacturing, IT, and industrial operations**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950190-a5d48200-a7dd-11ea-8208-567a6345c005.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950190-a5d48200-a7dd-11ea-8208-567a6345c005.png)`)`\n\n`_**CloudFlare prioritizing hospital security over web retailers**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950400-6e66d500-a7df-11ea-8814-212983bade56.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950400-6e66d500-a7df-11ea-8814-212983bade56.png)`)`\n\n`_**Amazon &amp;&amp; Facebook angling for web retailers over hospitals**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950431-a66e1800-a7df-11ea-933e-1ac98bda30e8.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950431-a66e1800-a7df-11ea-933e-1ac98bda30e8.png)`)`\n\n`_**Fastly executes on video and media delivery**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950653-45474400-a7e1-11ea-9e73-bdf121115612.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950653-45474400-a7e1-11ea-9e73-bdf121115612.png)`)`\n\n`The need for secure video, transactions, VR, and user experiences will be dramatically shot up and this is evident across many exciting technologies like Apple VR, Google Gaming, Square Banking, Facebook Shops with VR shopping, Microsoft software automations, and government developments.`\n\n`NET is one of the best positioned companies to pioneer this market at scale.`\n\n`# Market drivers &amp; a brief history of modern computing`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951016-9bb58200-a7e3-11ea-8398-151ec1df2bae.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951016-9bb58200-a7e3-11ea-8398-151ec1df2bae.png)`)`\n\n`The history of CDNs took a much larger turn when YouTube and Netflix became big players in data production and needed to cooperate with Internet Service Providers to manage the new dam and tunnels of water that the market had created.`\n\n`As many of you know, video data is large and streaming high quality videos at high speed to millions of users in real time was no laughing matter. Around this time you also began to see new products in ESports like` [`Twitch.tv`](https://twitch.tv/) `which would \"stream\" video.`\n\n`What had happened was that tech companies discovered a more cost effective way of delivering video and it was through controlling the actual pipeline. You would receive atomized content as needed rather than waiting for blocks of video to be received on your end (this was problematic in early Youtube days with broadband and DSL)`\n\n`The paradigm began to shift. Cloud computing and asynchronous models began to gain steam in the developer profession. We began a defining chapter of web optimizations that still continue today with serverless computing, real-time data, and growing user-experiences. At this time you began to notice that you no longer had to refresh your web page to receive new data. Remember when Facebook started to notify you rather than you checking your notifications? Do you remember when you had to check your email?`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951531-e1c01500-a7e6-11ea-87c0-f7bcdf9e6ffd.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951531-e1c01500-a7e6-11ea-87c0-f7bcdf9e6ffd.png)`)`\n\n`Today, developers are able to create or distribute product and services using networking and data center functions. This is largely what is recognized as cloud and serverless computing. This is has many consequences but primarily allows for unbelievably fast responses and avenues for user experiences.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951289-5003d800-a7e5-11ea-9aaf-c5b44063a66e.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951289-5003d800-a7e5-11ea-9aaf-c5b44063a66e.png)`)`\n\n`# What is serverless computing?`\n\n`Serverless computing allows a 25 year old developer like me run 5 different businesses on my dinky little Macintosh while I let Google and Cloudflare run my servers under an extremely cheap pricing model. That is a revolutionary change for software. It is one of the bread and butter of SaaS, IaaS, and other cloud style businesses where many business problems come out of the box for you.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83955922-1941b800-a80d-11ea-8675-28c216be50eb.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83955922-1941b800-a80d-11ea-8675-28c216be50eb.png)`)`\n\n`# Other competitive advantages of network and cloud computing`\n\n`The reason Snapchat did not gain any traction outside of the US was because Facebook provided a fundamentally faster service across WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook's investment in Akamai and its personal networking infrastructure allowed them to create a product that was fast, cheap and would work in various rural or economic conditions. Snapchat never stood a chance in the global social media landscape as a result.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951349-b7218c80-a7e5-11ea-9901-abd22b1f776e.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951349-b7218c80-a7e5-11ea-9901-abd22b1f776e.png)`)`\n\n`# What's special about CloudFlare as a network?`\n\n`What CloudFlare specifically offers against its competitors is its **privacy-first approach** and its quality of engineering. CloudFlare is essentially a distributed private content delivery network (pCDN) with a massive infrastructure effort to send data around the world safely and cheaply.`\n\n`This is fundamentally consequential as we are seeing massive nations tackle issues with how data can be utilized or privatized.`\n\n`Privacy and speed sells.

price.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83955846-4772c800-a80c-11ea-8f93-fc4fa6125455.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83955846-4772c800-a80c-11ea-8f93-fc4fa6125455.png)`)`\n\n`_**Facebook:

This, on top of its rapidly growing developer platform, is consequential for many reasons as a market-mover in the industry.`\n\n`# In Short`\n\n`CloudFlare so far has been shredding forward across multiple technical markets competing against by:`\n\n`- Competing marketshare against CISCO, Palo Alto Networks, and other hardware customers`\n\n`- Offering a way to not lock your organization into a big tech vendor`\n\n`- Promoting security and challenging Big Tech's direction with web development`\n\n`- Forming positive relationships with Shopify, Facebook, JD, Twitter, Baidu, TOR, and Microsoft`\n\n`- Pioneering the ease-of-use privacy movement with` [`1.1.1.1`](https://1.1.1.1/) `and distributing VPNs.`\n\n`- Growing a rapid, robust, cost-effective, and secure network across the world`\n\n`- _Providing a development platform that promotes the use extremely powerful and 'cutting edge' web computing._ **-&gt; YOU ARE HERE**`\n\n`- Creating a better internet.`\n\n`_**Cofounder of NPM - a primary pioneer in the cloud market**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951310-7164c400-a7e5-11ea-8675-e265e7c15336.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951310-7164c400-a7e5-11ea-8675-e265e7c15336.png)`)`\n\n`# The Thesis`\n\n`The economic value and convergence between e-commerce, global networking speeds, and video advancements is not anywhere close to realized. There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall economic development cycle. This timeframe has been accelerated greatly due to global market lockdowns and further risk of lockdown.`\n\n`Physical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world. Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950869-9c99e400-a7e2-11ea-8373-3e6f2b42b4bc.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950869-9c99e400-a7e2-11ea-8373-3e6f2b42b4bc.png)`)`\n\n`Infrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates. This market is **BIG** and no one or two players will be large enough to capture the market. It ranges from manufacturers, energy departments, web products, hospitals, governments, and so on. Security is serviced differently based on the industry. This much is obvious - a hospital will clearly protect patient records more closely than a manufacturer controlling the runtime of their high-speed machining assembly line.`\n\n`_**ZScaler servicing manufacturing, IT, and industrial operations**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950190-a5d48200-a7dd-11ea-8208-567a6345c005.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950190-a5d48200-a7dd-11ea-8208-567a6345c005.png)`)`\n\n`_**CloudFlare prioritizing hospital security over web retailers**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950400-6e66d500-a7df-11ea-8814-212983bade56.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950400-6e66d500-a7df-11ea-8814-212983bade56.png)`)`\n\n`_**Amazon &amp;&amp; Facebook angling for web retailers over hospitals**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950431-a66e1800-a7df-11ea-933e-1ac98bda30e8.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950431-a66e1800-a7df-11ea-933e-1ac98bda30e8.png)`)`\n\n`_**Fastly executes on video and media delivery**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950653-45474400-a7e1-11ea-9e73-bdf121115612.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950653-45474400-a7e1-11ea-9e73-bdf121115612.png)`)`\n\n`The need for secure video, transactions, VR, and user experiences will be dramatically shot up and this is evident across many exciting technologies like Apple VR, Google Gaming, Square Banking, Facebook Shops with VR shopping, Microsoft software automations, and government developments.`\n\n`NET is one of the best positioned companies to pioneer this market at scale.`\n\n`# Market drivers &amp; a brief history of modern computing`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951016-9bb58200-a7e3-11ea-8398-151ec1df2bae.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951016-9bb58200-a7e3-11ea-8398-151ec1df2bae.png)`)`\n\n`The history of CDNs took a much larger turn when YouTube and Netflix became big players in data production and needed to cooperate with Internet Service Providers to manage the new dam and tunnels of water that the market had created.`\n\n`As many of you know, video data is large and streaming high quality videos at high speed to millions of users in real time was no laughing matter. Around this time you also began to see new products in ESports like` [`Twitch.tv`](https://twitch.tv/) `which would \"stream\" video.`\n\n`What had happened was that tech companies discovered a more cost effective way of delivering video and it was through controlling the actual pipeline. You would receive atomized content as needed rather than waiting for blocks of video to be received on your end (this was problematic in early Youtube days with broadband and DSL)`\n\n`The paradigm began to shift. Cloud computing and asynchronous models began to gain steam in the developer profession. We began a defining chapter of web optimizations that still continue today with serverless computing, real-time data, and growing user-experiences. At this time you began to notice that you no longer had to refresh your web page to receive new data. Remember when Facebook started to notify you rather than you checking your notifications? Do you remember when you had to check your email?`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951531-e1c01500-a7e6-11ea-87c0-f7bcdf9e6ffd.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951531-e1c01500-a7e6-11ea-87c0-f7bcdf9e6ffd.png)`)`\n\n`Today, developers are able to create or distribute product and services using networking and data center functions. This is largely what is recognized as cloud and serverless computing. This is has many consequences but primarily allows for unbelievably fast responses and avenues for user experiences.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951289-5003d800-a7e5-11ea-9aaf-c5b44063a66e.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951289-5003d800-a7e5-11ea-9aaf-c5b44063a66e.png)`)`\n\n`# What is serverless computing?`\n\n`Serverless computing allows a 25 year old developer like me run 5 different businesses on my dinky little Macintosh while I let Google and Cloudflare run my servers under an extremely cheap pricing model. That is a revolutionary change for software. It is one of the bread and butter of SaaS, IaaS, and other cloud style businesses where many business problems come out of the box for you.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83955922-1941b800-a80d-11ea-8675-28c216be50eb.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83955922-1941b800-a80d-11ea-8675-28c216be50eb.png)`)`\n\n`# Other competitive advantages of network and cloud computing`\n\n`The reason Snapchat did not gain any traction outside of the US was because Facebook provided a fundamentally faster service across WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook's investment in Akamai and its personal networking infrastructure allowed them to create a product that was fast, cheap and would work in various rural or economic conditions. Snapchat never stood a chance in the global social media landscape as a result.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951349-b7218c80-a7e5-11ea-9901-abd22b1f776e.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951349-b7218c80-a7e5-11ea-9901-abd22b1f776e.png)`)`\n\n`# What's special about CloudFlare as a network?`\n\n`What CloudFlare specifically offers against its competitors is its **privacy-first approach** and its quality of engineering. CloudFlare is essentially a distributed private content delivery network (pCDN) with a massive infrastructure effort to send data around the world safely and cheaply.`\n\n`This is fundamentally consequential as we are seeing massive nations tackle issues with how data can be utilized or privatized.`\n\n`Privacy and speed sells.

price.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83955846-4772c800-a80c-11ea-8f93-fc4fa6125455.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83955846-4772c800-a80c-11ea-8f93-fc4fa6125455.png)`)`\n\n`_**Facebook:

That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction. We\u2019ve also seen new monthly lows in people on ventilators, in the ICU, and in hospitals.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Hard to believe, but there are still 7 months left in 2020. It hasn\u2019t been easy for any of us, and we continue to keep everyone impacted by this pandemic in mind, but we continue to see the glass as half full. The dual benefit of record monetary and fiscal policy should help create a bridge to help those most impacted, while the economy can slowly come back online later this year.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$NEPT** \n&gt; * **$GHM** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$CVGW** \n&gt; * **$AMC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$BF.B** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$WSG** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$RRGB** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JW.A** \n&gt; * **$SB** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$SRT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bgPdMCr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/d2EW1kr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uxSiJJr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3SIjcG7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cRBrPlt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DaheXAm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9mcHxTl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i8SNjWM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9xcBZPK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.12.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Inc. $392.90\n&gt; **Adobe Inc.

That should be enough to keep investors moving into stocks that benefit from an economic rebound and push the S&amp;P 500 into the green for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the coming week. There are a few economic reports, including inflation data, the consumer price index Wednesday and producer prices Thursday. Weekly jobless claims will be important Thursday to see if there\u2019s a drop in continuing clams, after May\u2019s employment report showed a surprising record gain of 2.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; The reopening trade was in full swing in the past week, especially Friday when stocks surged on the jobs report, which was expected to show a loss of 8.3 million jobs. The Nasdaq broke above its record high set on Feb. 19, and the S&amp;P 500 was just 1.1% away from turning positive for 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Even before the jobs report, investors were loading up on financials, industrials, transports and small caps, which were up more than 8% for the week and 18.4% in the past month. S&amp;P financials were 12.1% higher on the week, S&amp;P industrials were up 10.5, and the NYSE airline index jumped more than 35.4.%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is dominated by the reopening and it will be for another month,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cWith cyclicals outperforming, small [caps] outperforming, credit spreads coming in and then the bond yields going up, everybody \u2014 all facets of the financial markets \u2014 are sort of suggesting the same outcome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,193, a gain of 4.9%, and now traders are watching to see if it can scale the psychological 3,200 level. The Dow closed Friday at 27,110, up 6.8% for the week, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.4%, at 9,814 after reaching an intraday record high of 9,845 Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say the market will likely look past the protests that broke out in cities across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four policemen were charged with murder in his death. Looters joined the protests, some of which turned violent, but they quieted down towards the end of the week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher for a third week in a row, but a change this past week has been the abrupt lurch higher in Treasury yields. The 10-year rose to a high of 0.95% Friday, a quarter-point move in just three sessions. The move was already underway but got a lift Wednesday when ADP jobs data was not nearly as bad as expected. Yields ripped even higher after the May employment report showed the unemployment rate actually fell to 13.3%, instead of climbing to 20%, as expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond strategists said the Treasury market was now acknowledging the potential for a recovery, but not in the exuberant way the stock market has been. Since March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has risen more than 45%, but it took the 10-year Treasury until this week to get back the yield level it was at when stocks bottomed.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he believes a new bull market has been launched, but there could be pullbacks and some headwinds for the market coming up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen GDP is minus 30%, other issues don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s just one issue. But as the economy reopens again, the trade battles will matter again, presidential politics will matter again,\u201d said Paulsen, adding the budget deficit could also matter. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get removed from a sole focus. That isn\u2019t quite there but I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, and will release its statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a video briefing by Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhey would the Fed want to disrupt this with anything?\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to support the economy. They\u2019re going to stay away from negative rates or yield curve management. They\u2019re not going to do anything to scare the markets. They might certainly reassure people that they are still ready to provide support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, said the Fed may clarify where it stands on some of the extraordinary moves it has taken since it cut rates to zero. The Fed has been supporting the markets with asset purchases and multiple programs for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, for example.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think right now they\u2019re just trying to get this Main Street lending program to work. The question is are they going to do more things around what they do in terms of forward guidance and next steps of macro easing,\u201d Harris said.\n*****\n&gt; There has been speculation that the Fed would do some type of so-called yield curve control, a program to keep interest rates capped at certain levels. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early for that,\u201d said Harris. He said the Fed would be guaranteeing low rates for a long period of time if it does yield curve control.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYield curve control is basically open-ended quantitative easing,\u201d he said. The Fed is currently buying Treasurys but if it wanted to stop yields from rising too much as the economy improves, it could make targeted purchases.\n*****\n&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said it\u2019s possible the Fed could announce the yield curve control. \u201cWe\u2019ve said they could implement yield curve control out to three years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind that matches the length of the horizon of the economic projections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Powell has said the economy needs more fiscal help, and he could reiterate those comments Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Friday said he backs more stimulus. So far, the Democrats have put out a marker with their wish list for further spending, but there have been no negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; There was concern the strong jobs report could make it harder to get buy in for another big spending package. But some economists say the recovery needs a boost and states need funding to fill the holes in their budgets from coronavirus-related spending and a lack of tax receipts.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7klaXQm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PKTBzT2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a5JkAB6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M2x4Qoq.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qtJYfXN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bjiJWjV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UAi19KJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GQm4ruO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PQzyXLa.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uV1U7FN.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/wm2XJND.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yarkiMO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hFblu2G.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stocks Outpacing Analyst Price Targets\n\n&gt; This morning's jobs report shocked the financial world -- most notably the economists whose job it is to provide estimates. The consensus estimate among economists for May nonfarm payrolls was projecting a loss of more than 7 million jobs. The actual number that was reported did not just show a smaller than expected job loss, but it actually showed a gain in jobs of more than 2.5 million.\n\n&gt; We're seeing a similar situation play out in the equity analyst community. With the S&amp;P 500 now up 40%+ since its low less than three months ago, the average stock in the index is now trading above its consensus analyst price target that looks 12 months out. Analysts have simply not been able to catch up to the rapid rise we've seen for equity prices.\n\n&gt; It's extremely rare to see share prices move above consensus analyst price targets. We don't have the historical daily data on this, but anecdotally we can't remember a time when the spread has been this wide. As shown below, at the end of 2019 when the S&amp;P finished a massive rally, equity prices were 5.5% below the consensus price target. That was seen as a very tight spread prior to what we're seeing now. At the lows in March, the average share price had dropped all the way to $92.50 compared to an average consensus price target of $143.20. That projected a gain of 54.9% at the time!\n\n&gt; Since March 23rd, the average share price has risen from $92.50 up to $138.40, while the average analyst price target has fallen from $143.20 to $136. Current price targets no longer project a gain for the average S&amp;P 500 stock, but rather a 1.7% drop.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/avgpricetarget.png))**\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq's Historical Run\n\n&gt; At its highs earlier this morning, the Nasdaq Composite was within 2% of its record high from earlier in the year. Besides the steep V-shape of the Nasdaq's pattern over the last four months, the other aspect of the chart that stands out is just how steep the 50-day moving average is trending lately.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-50DMAa.png))**\n\n&gt; To illustrate just how steep the Nasdaq's 50-DMA has become, the chart below shows the daily percentage change of the 50-day going back to 1971. Currently, the Nasdaq 50-DMA is rising at an average of over 0.5% per day. That's an incredible slope and a level that has been exceeded only a handful of times in the Nasdaq's 50-year history.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060420-Nasdaq-Composite1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big Gains From Smaller Tech\n\n&gt; It's still difficult to fathom the moves in the US equity market over the last four months. The fact that the Nasdaq and more specifically the Technology sector aren't far from record highs is definitely something no one was expecting two months ago. There's an old market saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down, but in the latest market cycle, the elevator up was almost as fast as the way down!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Nasdaq.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Technology-Sector.png))**\n\n&gt; If you've been following the markets, all you've likely heard up until recently is that large-cap tech, and more specifically, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are single-handedly driving the market higher. The reality is not nearly as clear-cut. Given their market caps, the \"Big 5\" (as they're often referred to) have done a lot of heavy lifting, but in terms of performance, they're hardly the only game in town.\n\n&gt; The table below lists Technology sector stocks in the Russell 3000 with market caps of more than $1 billion that are outperforming all of the 'big 5' tech stocks on a YTD basis. Actually, since Amazon is doing so well relative to the rest of the \"big 5\" these are all stocks that are outperforming Amazon. If we looked for stocks that were doing better than the average return of the \"big 5\" the list would be a lot, lot longer (+16.4%).\n\n&gt; Looking through the list of names below, the two top-performing names are Zscaler (ZS) and Twilio (TWLO), which have both more than doubled. Behind these two, DocuSign (DOCU) and Sprout Social (SPT) are both knocking on the door of triple-digits. All 28 of the names listed have market caps of $1 billion, but the average market cap is just over $21 billion, while Nvidia (NVDA) is the largest company on the list with a market cap of $216 billion. For the most part, these aren't names that have been driving the indices, but anyone holding these stocks in their portfolio probably doesn't care!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/06/060320-Tech-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best 50-Day Rally Ever\n\n&gt; In many ways, what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020 has been both record-breaking and devastating. From the S&amp;P 500 Index peak on February 19 to the bear market lows March 23, stocks lost 33.9%. Now, 50 trading days later, stocks have gained 39.6%, for the largest 50-day rally since the S&amp;P 500 moved to 500 stocks in 1957.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere are no rollercoasters that can replicate what stocks have done so far in 2020,\u201d exclaimed LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHere\u2019s the catch though: Big 50-day rallies in the past have taken place near the start of new bull markets, and the returns going out a year were quite bullish.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 39.6% gain in 50 days was the greatest 50-day rally ever, besting the previous best in October 1982. What\u2019s important to note here is that many of these rallies took place coming off major market lows, and delivered quite strong returns going out 6 to 12 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/best-fifty-days.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Although we have near-term worries given this historic run, as some sentiment indicators such as put/call ratios are showing some froth, from a bigger picture perspective, this strong 50-day rally offers a reason to think stock prices may be even higher this time next year.\n\n*****\n\n# 2020 In Charts\n\n&gt; 2020 is only five months old, but in many ways it is one of the most historic years we\u2019ve ever seen. \u201c2020 went from moving along nicely, to seeing the worst recession in a generation and the fastest bear market ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNow stocks are in the midst of one of the best bull runs ever, even though the economy remains extremely weak, thanks to record stimulus and hopes over a vaccine.\u201d\n&gt; \nTo best sum it all up, here are 10 charts that tell the picture of 2020 so far.\n\n&gt; 1.) The 2010s were the first decade in history to go all 10 years without a recession, which of course ended just months into the new decade, as the economy stopped. Stocks gained 13.5% on an annual basis last decade, surprisingly, only the third-best decade over the past four.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2.) This is an election year, and the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower when a President is up for reelection since FDR in 1940. Although this seemed nearly impossible at the March lows, it is looking like this incredible streak could have a chance in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 3.) One of the first signs something could go wrong in 2020 was stocks fell in January. Historically, this has meant potential trouble for the final 11 months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 4.) As fears over COVID-19 gripped the world, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its fastest bear market ever, in only 19 days. To put this in perspective, this was the fastest bear market in the 124-year history of the Dow.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 5.) Mark Twain said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes\u201d. Looking at history, every 50 years there has been a terrible pandemic and stocks fell more than 30%. We don\u2019t know if the ultimate lows are in this time, but so far, history is rhyming.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 6.) More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, while the unemployment rate soared to near 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. Record drops in manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer spending have all taken place in the past two months as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 7.) A recession is here, ending the streak of 128 months in a row without one. What is unique about the previous expansion was nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew only 50%, about the average growth seen during the previous expansions, but this expansion was nearly twice as long as the average expansion (10 years versus 5 years).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 8.) The bounce off of the March 23 S&amp;P 500 lows has been historic in many ways. In fact, it was one of the best 20-day rallies ever, with previous best rallies seeing strong returns 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 9.) As scary as it was on the way down, stocks have come roaring back, gaining more than 35% from the March 23 lows. This would classify as the greatest bear market bounce ever, which opens the question: is this more than a bear market bounce and instead the start of a new bull market?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 10.) The number of COVID-19 tests in the US nearly doubled in May versus what was seen in April. Additionally, fewer and fewer tests are coming back positive. Testing is one of the key ways we will beat this and this is a step in the right direction.

DON\u2019T. SELL. EARLY:  This is more so if you\u2019re down early.  IE: I scooped up CEQP and G NUS after some DD and discussions, and knee jerk sold them after a few bad hours.  If you\u2019re investing in something, believe in it.  If you believe in it, you should also believe that it can have a bad day or two, just like us.  \n\n\n2.) Timing the market is a fruitless exercise.  Daily peaks and valleys seem like an eternity when you refresh your app 100x a day, but the reality of the matter is most 3M/1YR/5YR charts show a much more continuous slope on stock +\\-.   DCA is a much much more diligent tactic, or just buying every week.  Unless of course you\u2019re a DT, but I don\u2019t have $25k.\n\n3.)  Know your strategy ahead of time.  Is this for retirement?  Is this to make some extra $ every week?   I\u2019ve finally settled into about an 85/15 ratio, with the 15 representing my short holds which I try to make quick $ off of (this includes selling options for equity profit).  \n\n4.). I truly believe that Reddit influences the market.  I really do.   I know people will scoff and think I\u2019m an idiot, and god damnit maybe i am.  But look at \u201cmeme\u201d stocks that get takes about CONSTANTLY in here (G NUS, VTIX, DKNG, TSLA to an extent, etc).  Look at the volume on them too.  WSB is a graveyard full of puts worshipers who think it\u2019ll be a Bear Market til we die.  I prefer the r/stocks forum much more.  Regardless, I would argue that many a pump-and-dump have been driven home by this very audience.  \n\n5.)  Dont beat yourself up over missed profits IF you still profited.  Example: I\u2019m a Barstool Sports Guy, not really a Stoolie since I\u2019m 34 with a wife and kids, but I like their stuff.  Except Davey Day Trader, that shit is so stupid. Anyway... TL;DR, loved Penn once I heard about that merger, bought when they plummeted to $5.40 a share, and sold for $14.  I missed out on a TON of money, but I still made nearly 2x what I invested.  \n\n6.) I monitor volume, call prices, and resistance points when buying now.  Three things I\u2019ve found more valuable than others.  I do not think i know enough about business at the highest level to give too much thought to market cap.  Also, if a stock just can\u2019t seem to get past or far past a particular $$ amount time after time, that\u2019s a red flag for me as well. \n\n7.)  Dont buy or sell the first and last 30 min of each day, unless you really really have a good feeling about something.  People buying up and/or selling off the first and last half hour of each day is a real thing (330-4 is seemingly always a ski slope of red, but I think that can be attributed to the market being very bullish the last few weeks). If you\u2019re holding an option on a stock that went to the moon after hours, and you\u2019re looking to sell the option, do it the SECOND the market opens up.  \n\n\n8.)  Option trading is the tits if done right.  Unless the stock is going to Mars, I\u2019m selling the option and not executing it.  You can find some real profitable peaks when tracking the value of your call options.

PTON is a technology SAAS product with the most profitable hardware business you\u2019ve ever seen. Peloton bikes have nearly 50% profit margin and their subscriptions will soon be 70 percent profit.

Below are five reasons why competitors will have trouble penetrating this space:\n\n1. Vertically integrated platform - Like Apple, Tesla, and now Netflix, Peloton is vertically integrated. This means it controls the entire value chain of the business including Hardware, Original Content, and Proprietary Software (including UI/UX). This allows PTON to have a much greater control of its supply chain versus its customers and produce products at a lower cost.\n\n2. Brand Sex-Appeal, Social Quotient and Customer Loyalty - Peloton\u2019s aspirational positioning makes it the iPhone of at-home fitness. The elegant design, high touch brand experience with 96 luxurious global showrooms, and elevated experience through various digital and physical touchpoints, makes it an extremely attractive product offering. As a result, it has a cult-like following, and power-users act like brand evangelists. As per Peloton, 43% of first-time buyers heard about the brand through WOM. I can vouch for this personally since a friend who uses Peloton was so passionate that she converted me into a buyer while doing research on this story. Voila! New customer, zero CAC.\n\n3. The element of social engagement \u2014 we ride together, compete with each other, facetime while riding to push each other, give high-fives, and earn awards, makes this an immersive and socially rich experience, all from the comfort of your home.\n\n4. Recurring revenue bundle of HW and SW (Rundle) \\[Translation: higher switching costs for consumers\\]\n\n5. Efficient Scale and Cost Advantage - Given the number of paid users are now close to 1M, and likely to double over the next 12\u201324 months, Peloton will have a cost advantage that will be hard to match. Especially, when it comes to content production cost, which will get amortized across users, and continues to decline at a unit level as the base of consumers grows. Think Netflix vs. a new streaming service, the economies of scale that Netflix have are extremely hard to match for any new streaming service.\n\nWhether you believe in Peloton or think it\u2019s an overvalued POS, we all can agree that the next quarter will be even more stellar than the most-recent earnings, reported on May 6. Before I make my case, let\u2019s discuss PTON\u2019s latest earnings report. I\u2019ve listened to hundreds of earnings calls and I\u2019ve never heard a call go as smooth as Peloton\u2019s last. \n\nWhy was it so good?\n\n\\#1: Peloton expects to turn a profit this year, 2020. This is huge news as PTON previously did not expect to turn a profit until 2023. The fact that they will show a profit three years sooner than expected should be reason enough to quit reading and buy calls. Seriously, when have you heard a company turn a profit three years earlier than anticipated?  \n\n\\#2: I correctly predicted that PTON paused cancellable advertising in most of its major markets starting in mid-March as demand for the bike outstrips manufacturing. Continued growth and engagement despite a pullback in media spend signals that Peloton's years of brand-building and word-of-mouth referrals are paying off.\n\n\\#3: Average net monthly churn, which Peloton uses to measure retention of connected fitness subscribers, hit 0.46%, its lowest level in four years.\n\n\\#4: 2020 Revenue guidance was lifted from $1.54 billion to 1.74 billion (and still, PTON is sandbagging this revised guidance \u2013 more on that later)\n\n\\#5: Not only are they the Apple of fitness, but PTON\u2019s CEO showed similarities to Steve Jobs on this last call \u2013 after giving the most impressive earnings call I\u2019ve ever heard, PTON CEO John Foley demonstrated that rarely seen but immediately distinguishable confidence mark that only a few have shown \u2013 his voice carried a weight equal to that of his company\u2019s numbers. He was bold and certain that  PTON is here to stay and further revolutionize the fitness industry. It was refreshing to hear an unscripted CEO like Elon or Jobs \u2013 you can tell this Harvard grad has unmatched passion and belief in his company. We all know the impact a CEO can have on stock performance. \n\n\\#6: average monthly workouts per subscriber coming in at 17.7 -- up from 13.9 in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, Peloton said it has logged 44.2 million connected subscriber workouts, up from 18 million this time last year. \n\n\\#7: New products including a cheaper version of the bike and tread that may be introduced as early as this year.\n\nThat\u2019s all I care to type in regards to the call, but for further evidence I recommend listening to their earnings report for yourself. \n\nSo why will the numbers be better on the next earnings report due in August? Because PTON DOES NOT COUNT REVENUE UNTIL THE BIKE IS DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER\u2019S HOUSE. If there\u2019s anything to take away from this DD, it\u2019s this. Let\u2019s breakdown why this is so important:\n\nLate February: Americans start to pay attention to Covid-19\n\nMarch 16: Gyms close in my state (Michigan) and virtually across the nation, simultaneously google searches for peloton nearly triple. \n\nPeloton\u2019s lead time on bikes is around 6-10 weeks.\n\nThis means that ONLY A FRACTION of the covid-19 orders were captured in the last earnings report. Given lead time is 6-to-10 weeks, if people ordered PTON bikes as soon as their gym closed (March 16), then there is a very slim chance the bike was delivered to the customer\u2019s house in less than 2 weeks. The next earnings report will show the true impact of Covid.\n\nEarlier I said that PTON sandbagged their revised guidance of 1.74 billion and I will explain why.\n\nFor the first three quarters of PTON\u2019s fiscal year, revenue sits at 1.22 billion. This means PTON only needs 520 million dollars next quarter to meet its revised annual guidance of 1.74 billion. This was a SAND BAG estimate because PTON only has to have the same revenue as last quarter. We know this will be a piece of cake because again last quarter only captured a small fraction of the covid demand, lead time for new orders is already pushed out to August in some parts of the country. Everything Peloton manufactures this year will be sold. This is holiday-like demand without the holiday-like discounts and a massive pause in ad spending.\n\nBy now you probably agree that next quarter, Q4, will be impressive - but you may assume the quarter after next we\u2019ll see a dip in revenue. However, I\u2019ll argue that the revenue from the PTON tread will be Peloton\u2019s saving grace. The treadmill was cancelled in mid-march which has caused pent-up demand for the product. Additionally, peloton will be sitting on a large inventory of these treadmills, so we will not  see the same supply issue as we have with the PTON bike. Not to mention the tread is twice as expensive as the bike which will further boost PTON\u2019s already skyrocketing revenue. If you got on the Facebook Peloton page, you\u2019ll see the PTON cult is eager to expand their peloton gym by adding the tread. \n\nI suggest readers go to the Official Peloton Facebook Page and spend an hour reading comments. The deeper you look at an individual, customer-to-customer level, you will realize that there is something special with this product. This FB page has almost 300k members and everyone raves about their product in a cult-like manner. These members share very personal information and goals with each other thanks to the social and trusting community the Peloton brand has built.\n\nThe Peloton instructors also add to the engagement factor in this socially fit community. They have reached celebrity-like status in a culture obsessed with celebrities. Except riders get to see these celebrities everyday live and may get personal shout out from their idol instructor. This might not be a big deal to people on this sub, but think how geeked a Karen or Becky would be if a Kardashian gave them a shout out, live.\n\nA lot of people think Peloton is a cult. Why? Because it is. Why else do you think I spent over 100 hours researching PTON in the past month, and spent an additional 4 hours on this post? Why else do you think users try to casually fit Peloton into their everyday conversations in hopes to recruit a new cult-member? In fact, it was reported last quarter that 43% OF USERS PURCHASED THEIR PTON VIA WORD OF MOUTH \u2013 the least expensive and most effective form of advertising. Peloton often jokes that its best salespeople are its customers. I can vouch for this as I\u2019ve already convinced 3 of my friends to join the cult \u2013 this word of mouth advertising is spreading faster than Covid. And every time Peloton gets a new member, it\u2019s salesforce grows. \n\nIf you missed out on Netflix or Amazon, don\u2019t miss out on PTON. \n\nPTON 50C 10/16.\n\nTLDR:\n\nPTON is not a covid story. They had the best earnings report I\u2019ve ever heard and their next will be even greater. They will yet again smash guidance, as only a fraction of the covid orders were reflected on this last earnings report (PTON doesn\u2019t count the revenue until it is delivered to the customer\u2019s house). PTON will sell every bike they make for the remainder of 2020 and will reintroduce the treadmill which is in high inventory to meet pent-up demand. PTON has a very defensible moat and threatens any company that steals its IP. PTON will reach profitability this year, three years sooner than anticipated. 43 percent of buyers last quarter bought via word of mouth, emphasizing the power of this cult and their loyalty to the product. PTON is set up to be one of the most profitable companies thanks to its vertically integrated platform and reoccurring subscription model.\n\nWord of advice: buy calls with expiration dates into at least October to ensure next earnings report is included.

The deeper you look at an individual, customer-to-customer level, you will realize that there is something special with this product. This FB page has almost 300k members and everyone raves about their product in a cult-like manner. These members share very personal information and goals with each other thanks to the social and trusting community the Peloton brand has built.\n\nThe Peloton instructors also add to the engagement factor in this socially fit community. They have reached celebrity-like status in a culture obsessed with celebrities. Except riders get to see these celebrities everyday live and may get personal shout out from their idol instructor. This might not be a big deal to people on this sub, but think how geeked a Karen or Becky would be if a Kardashian gave them a shout out, live.\n\nA lot of people think Peloton is a cult. Why? Because it is. Why else do you think I spent over 100 hours researching PTON in the past month, and spent an additional 4 hours on this post? Why else do you think users try to casually fit Peloton into their everyday conversations in hopes to recruit a new cult-member? In fact, it was reported last quarter that 43% OF USERS PURCHASED THEIR PTON VIA WORD OF MOUTH \u2013 the least expensive and most effective form of advertising. Peloton often jokes that its best salespeople are its customers. I can vouch for this as I\u2019ve already convinced 3 of my friends to join the cult \u2013 this word of mouth advertising is spreading faster than Covid. And every time Peloton gets a new member, it\u2019s salesforce grows. \n\nIf you missed out on Netflix or Amazon, don\u2019t miss out on PTON. \n\nPTON 50C 10/16.\n\nTLDR:\n\nPTON is not a covid story. They had the best earnings report I\u2019ve ever heard and their next will be even greater. They will yet again smash guidance, as only a fraction of the covid orders were reflected on this last earnings report (PTON doesn\u2019t count the revenue until it is delivered to the customer\u2019s house). PTON will sell every bike they make for the remainder of 2020 and will reintroduce the treadmill which is in high inventory to meet pent-up demand. PTON has a very defensible moat and threatens any company that steals its IP. PTON will reach profitability this year, three years sooner than anticipated. 43 percent of buyers last quarter bought via word of mouth, emphasizing the power of this cult and their loyalty to the product. PTON is set up to be one of the most profitable companies thanks to its vertically integrated platform and reoccurring subscription model.\n\nWord of advice: buy calls with expiration dates into at least October to ensure next earnings report is included. It will be stellar.

But even these\nfigures understate the health of WFC\u2019s business: the lack of growth in the loan book is due entirely to\nan asset cap put in place by regulators to punish the company for its transgressions.

Enjoy!\n\n\\--- \n\nStrong earnings reports, especially from tech companies, drove the markets upwards last week, despite unemployment hitting 14.7%, as the economy shed 20.5M jobs. For context, unemployment reached as high as 25% during the Great Depression. Given the current state of joblessness, why are markets so bullish? Here are the details:\n\n1. **Nearly 30 states have begun to reopen, with another five states with plans to reopen soon.** Investors were bullish about the market as the vast majority of states began to reopen facilities ranging from beaches to retail. As money begins to start flowing through the economy again, investors expect a gradual return to market levels before COVID-19.\n2. **The Nasdaq is in positive territory year-to-date as tech stocks have continued to outperform despite COVID-19.** The Nasdaq, an index weighted towards tech, has entered positive territory since the beginning of 2020 due to positive earnings reports from tech companies, including Facebook (FB), Match.com (MTCH), Uber (UBER), and others. Investors expect the index to reach pre-COVID levels soon enough.\n3. **The FDA approved the first antigen test for detecting COVID-19.** The FDA approved Quidel Corp's (QDEL) antigen test for quickly screening for COVID-19. QDEL's antigen test can be completed in minutes compared to traditional PCR tests, which can take hours. This test will help the economy reopen by enabling mass testing at the workplace and beyond. We believe this news will drive the markets upward this coming week.\n4. **The April unemployment report indicated 14.7% unemployment, with tech companies like Uber contributing with layoffs.** The federal government released April's unemployment report last Friday and demonstrated a 14.7% unemployment rate. Unemployment mostly stemmed from the hospitality and travel industry. However, tech companies, including Uber (UBER) have recently contributed to layoffs. Uber is cutting 3,700 workers, while Airbnb and Yelp plan on cutting 1,900 and &gt;1,000 employees respectively. While this is devastating for the employees, investors see this decision by tech companies as a cost-cutting measure needed for these companies to achieve greater profitability.\n5. **After COVID containment success, South Korea recorded highest daily infections in a month.**\u00a0South Korea recorded 34 new COVID-19 infections today, the highest one day increase in COVID-19 infections in a month. The U.S. should also expect there to be a second wave of COVID-19 breakouts as the economy opens. However, because countries and people are better prepared for COVID-19, the impact of the second outbreak will not likely result in additional quarantine measures and be dampened in terms of cases and deaths.

Enjoy!\n\n\\--- \n\nStrong earnings reports, especially from tech companies, drove the markets upwards last week, despite unemployment hitting 14.7%, as the economy shed 20.5M jobs. For context, unemployment reached as high as 25% during the Great Depression. Given the current state of joblessness, why are markets so bullish? Here are the details:\n\n1. **Nearly 30 states have begun to reopen, with another five states with plans to reopen soon.** Investors were bullish about the market as the vast majority of states began to reopen facilities ranging from beaches to retail. As money begins to start flowing through the economy again, investors expect a gradual return to market levels before COVID-19.\n2. **The Nasdaq is in positive territory year-to-date as tech stocks have continued to outperform despite COVID-19.** The Nasdaq, an index weighted towards tech, has entered positive territory since the beginning of 2020 due to positive earnings reports from tech companies, including Facebook (FB), Match.com (MTCH), Uber (UBER), and others. Investors expect the index to reach pre-COVID levels soon enough.\n3. **The FDA approved the first antigen test for detecting COVID-19.** The FDA approved Quidel Corp's (QDEL) antigen test for quickly screening for COVID-19. QDEL's antigen test can be completed in minutes compared to traditional PCR tests, which can take hours. This test will help the economy reopen by enabling mass testing at the workplace and beyond. We believe this news will drive the markets upward this coming week.\n4. **The April unemployment report indicated 14.7% unemployment, with tech companies like Uber contributing with layoffs.** The federal government released April's unemployment report last Friday and demonstrated a 14.7% unemployment rate. Unemployment mostly stemmed from the hospitality and travel industry. However, tech companies, including Uber (UBER) have recently contributed to layoffs. Uber is cutting 3,700 workers, while Airbnb and Yelp plan on cutting 1,900 and &gt;1,000 employees respectively. While this is devastating for the employees, investors see this decision by tech companies as a cost-cutting measure needed for these companies to achieve greater profitability.\n5. **After COVID containment success, South Korea recorded highest daily infections in a month.**\u00a0South Korea recorded 34 new COVID-19 infections today, the highest one day increase in COVID-19 infections in a month. The U.S. should also expect there to be a second wave of COVID-19 breakouts as the economy opens. However, because countries and people are better prepared for COVID-19, the impact of the second outbreak will not likely result in additional quarantine measures and be dampened in terms of cases and deaths. Furthermore,\u00a0research is beginning to indicate that even mildly affected COVID-19 cases produce antibodies, suggesting potential for at least partial immunity even from those who had low to no symptoms.\u00a0\n\n**Overall, I remain optimistic about the U.S. economic recovery.** While unemployment is incredibly high, government stimulus have enabled most U.S. citizens to sustain in this difficult situation.

I may rotate a few of the positions based on changing conditions where I lose faith in the company's future, but I don't want to be too active managing these and with each taking up a relatively small percentage I don't have to overthink it - just like an ETF holder.\n\nAlso, I will put the dividend stocks into my non-taxable Roth and low dividend stocks in my taxable account to minimize the annual tax burden and allow for compounding returns.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 643457, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why not create my own equal weighted ETF?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gi2ptt/why_not_create_my_own_equal_weighted_etf/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1589248822.0}], [[], false, "inthegreen07", null, [], null, "text", "t2_6ee19vyg", false, false, [], false, false, 1589075174, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ggsglo/long_holds/", {}, "ggsglo", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 27, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/ggsglo/long_holds/", false, 6, 1589075175, 1, "I started up and bought Chegg, peloton, Uber, Moderna, DraftKings and Gilead.

Most people actually start of trading penny stocks as opposed to what are known as *\"blue chip stocks.\"* Like anything else, there are pros and cons to each. I wanted to share this post to talk about some of the misconceptions of penny stocks, and explain why I personally focus on them with my own day trading.\n\nFirst, **what even is a penny stock?** No... penny stocks are not just stocks worth a single penny and no they're not just stocks worth less than $1.00. By definition, any stock priced below $5.00 per share is considered a penny stock.\n\nPenny stocks are priced low for a reason. They're *usually* the stock of a lesser-know company with not-so-reliable reputation to their shareholders. That's why they have such a bad reputation in general, and is why a lot of people think trading penny stocks is pure gambling. At the end of the day, penny stocks offer day traders a lot more than most blue chip stocks offer.\n\nA **blue chip stock** is the stock of a huge company with a great reputation. These are stocks like Apple ($AAPL), Amazon ($AMZN), Google ($GOOG), Facebook ($FB), etc... basically \"household name\" companies. Although these seem like the better investment options, they're not necessarily going to be the better option for an average trader.\n\n**Penny Stock Pros:**\n\n**Higher Volatility:** Penny stocks generally have much higher volatility than blue chip stocks, making them more high risk, high reward. A certain amount of volatility is needed for day trading! Without it there is not enough price movement to be able to get in and out of positions within the day like day traders do. The high volatility in the penny stock market is the reason traders are able to make 10%, 20%, even 50% or more in a single day... a *very* rare occurrence in the blue chip market.\n\n**Less Money Needed:** With penny stocks you may be able to buy 1,000s of shares at a time with a small account when you'd only be able to buy a few shares of a blue chip stock. Because of the extra volatility in the penny stock market, your 1,000 share penny stock investment has potential for a greater return than your 1,000 share blue chip investment... even though you\u2019d be investing far more capital into the blue chip stock. With that being said, penny stocks are usually looked at as the much better option for new traders with limited capital to start trading. In fact, that why most new traders do end up starting with penny stocks, which leads me to the third \"pro.\"\n\n**Less \"Competition\":** Your competition in the stock market is every single other buyer and seller. Everyone is competing against each other to get the best prices and to buy low and sell high for a profit. When one person loses money, another gains! *So..*. would you rather be competing against multi-billion dollar funds and investment firms in the blue chip market, or a herd on new traders with little-to-no experience in the penny stock market? Now that's not to say there aren't still investment firms and algorithmic trading taking place in the penny stock market, but it is less common than it is in the blue chip market.\n\n**Penny Stock Cons:**\n\n**Higher Volatility:** A double-edged sword. As I already mentioned above, the higher volatility of the penny stock market can definitely be a big benefit, but if you're not careful it can also cause larger losses than you would experience with less volatility. This is why risk management and proper position sizing is crucial, especially when trading stocks with high volatility.\n\n**Less Volume:** This is one of the concerns that most traders bring up when they talk about why they don't trade penny stocks. In my opinion, this doesn't make much sense as a \"con\" just for penny stocks, because there are plenty blue chip stocks with low liquidity and volume as well. As day traders, we have to adapt to the market on a daily basis. This means finding the stocks making larger-than-average moves with high relative volume and, usually, news or a press release to go along. Volume is only an issue with day trading penny stocks if you're choosing the wrong penny stocks to day trade.\n\n**Low-Quality Companies:** Again, penny stocks are priced low for a reason. If they were multi-billion dollar companies with years of growing profitability, their stock price would reflect that. It's important to trade the stock, don't fall in love with it! You don't want to invest in a penny stock long-term, because the odds of you picking the next Amazon of Apple are slim to none. Instead, take advantage of the increase volatility brought by the penny stock market for day trading and look to the more reliable blue chip market for your swing trades longer-term investments.\n\nAs you can see, there are definitely some pros and cons to consider before diving into the penny stock market to start day trading. If you have the discipline to manage risk properly then they can be a great option to grow a small trading account in a short period of time. *Otherwise,* you may want to take things a bit more slowly by focussing your trading on less volatile, more stable blue chip stocks.", false, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 629518, "public", "self", "Trading Penny Stocks vs. Blue Chip Stocks", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gc9ujb/trading_penny_stocks_vs_blue_chip_stocks/", "all_ads", 6, 1588435350.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mtmtrader", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_53ar4nx0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1588438950, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gc9ujb/trading_penny_stocks_vs_blue_chip_stocks/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gc9ujb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "8acd2324-65e6-11e5-a263-122ab0778f8b", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/gc9ujb/trading_penny_stocks_vs_blue_chip_stocks/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1588439905, "score": 2, "selftext": "Trading Penny Stocks vs. Blue Chip Stocks\n\nPenny stocks get a bad reputation in the stock market, rightfully so, but that doesn't necessarily make them bad to trade.

These are stocks like Apple ($AAPL), Amazon ($AMZN), Google ($GOOG), Facebook ($FB), etc... basically \"household name\" companies. Although these seem like the better investment options, they're not necessarily going to be the better option for an average trader.\n\n**Penny Stock Pros:**\n\n**Higher Volatility:** Penny stocks generally have much higher volatility than blue chip stocks, making them more high risk, high reward. A certain amount of volatility is needed for day trading! Without it there is not enough price movement to be able to get in and out of positions within the day like day traders do. The high volatility in the penny stock market is the reason traders are able to make 10%, 20%, even 50% or more in a single day... a *very* rare occurrence in the blue chip market.\n\n**Less Money Needed:** With penny stocks you may be able to buy 1,000s of shares at a time with a small account when you'd only be able to buy a few shares of a blue chip stock. Because of the extra volatility in the penny stock market, your 1,000 share penny stock investment has potential for a greater return than your 1,000 share blue chip investment... even though you\u2019d be investing far more capital into the blue chip stock. With that being said, penny stocks are usually looked at as the much better option for new traders with limited capital to start trading. In fact, that why most new traders do end up starting with penny stocks, which leads me to the third \"pro.\"\n\n**Less \"Competition\":** Your competition in the stock market is every single other buyer and seller. Everyone is competing against each other to get the best prices and to buy low and sell high for a profit. When one person loses money, another gains! *So..*. would you rather be competing against multi-billion dollar funds and investment firms in the blue chip market, or a herd on new traders with little-to-no experience in the penny stock market? Now that's not to say there aren't still investment firms and algorithmic trading taking place in the penny stock market, but it is less common than it is in the blue chip market.\n\n**Penny Stock Cons:**\n\n**Higher Volatility:** A double-edged sword. As I already mentioned above, the higher volatility of the penny stock market can definitely be a big benefit, but if you're not careful it can also cause larger losses than you would experience with less volatility. This is why risk management and proper position sizing is crucial, especially when trading stocks with high volatility.\n\n**Less Volume:** This is one of the concerns that most traders bring up when they talk about why they don't trade penny stocks. In my opinion, this doesn't make much sense as a \"con\" just for penny stocks, because there are plenty blue chip stocks with low liquidity and volume as well. As day traders, we have to adapt to the market on a daily basis. This means finding the stocks making larger-than-average moves with high relative volume and, usually, news or a press release to go along. Volume is only an issue with day trading penny stocks if you're choosing the wrong penny stocks to day trade.\n\n**Low-Quality Companies:** Again, penny stocks are priced low for a reason. If they were multi-billion dollar companies with years of growing profitability, their stock price would reflect that. It's important to trade the stock, don't fall in love with it! You don't want to invest in a penny stock long-term, because the odds of you picking the next Amazon of Apple are slim to none. Instead, take advantage of the increase volatility brought by the penny stock market for day trading and look to the more reliable blue chip market for your swing trades longer-term investments.\n\nAs you can see, there are definitely some pros and cons to consider before diving into the penny stock market to start day trading. If you have the discipline to manage risk properly then they can be a great option to grow a small trading account in a short period of time. *Otherwise,* you may want to take things a bit more slowly by focussing your trading on less volatile, more stable blue chip stocks.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 629518, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Trading Penny Stocks vs. Blue Chip Stocks", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gc9ujb/trading_penny_stocks_vs_blue_chip_stocks/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1588435350.0}], [[], false, "mtmtrader", null, [], null, "text", "t2_53ar4nx0", false, false, [], false, false, 1588432829, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gc865q/trading_penny_stocks_vs_blue_chip_stocks/", {}, "gc865q", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "discussion", [], "8acd2324-65e6-11e5-a263-122ab0778f8b", "Discussion", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 6, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/gc865q/trading_penny_stocks_vs_blue_chip_stocks/", false, 6, 1588432831, 1, "Penny stocks get a bad reputation in the stock market, rightfully so, but that doesn't necessarily make them bad to trade.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks face headwinds as investors look forward to a big earnings week, a Fed meeting and state reopenings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/stocks-face-headwinds-as-investors-look-forward-to-a-big-earnings-week-a-fed-meeting-and-state-reopenings.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The stock market is struggling to make headway, as a big week of events rolls around, including a Federal Reserve meeting, the first look at post-shutdown economic growth and earnings from more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s a busy week for earnings, and some of the biggest blue chips are likely to join the growing list of companies withdrawing guidance amid the uncertainty of how the coronavirus and shutdowns are impacting their business. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald\u2019s are among about 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&amp;P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia\u2019s plan to reopen.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it\u2019s a fundamental story,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said it\u2019s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that\u2019s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. \u201cPeople are watching what\u2019s going on in places like Georgia, but they\u2019re also watching what\u2019s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s really one thing that really matters. It\u2019s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed bazooka\n&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it\u2019s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what\u2019s working and the things that still need to happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tilley said the Fed\u2019s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. \u201cIt looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they\u2019ve come back in,\u201d he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank\u2019s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said this Fed meeting isn\u2019t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they\u2019re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re borrowing from a bank or whether you\u2019re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Economic impact\n&gt; First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.\n*****\n&gt; Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.\n*****\n&gt; The impact of that should show up in Friday\u2019s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,\u201d Tilley said.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings\n&gt; Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.\n*****\n&gt; An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It\u2019s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,\u201d said Golub. \u201cMy estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it\u2019s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that\u2019s too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. \u201cWe had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that\u2019s really bad.\u201d Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3vJvFZR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/B4Di7Fh.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/7XXBq3H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QyE3rll.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jyp5KqQ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fCYKkgg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PdPKvec.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sEY6EDm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QuCVREP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gkpOUiT.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GrUMf6m.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election-year Mays: DJIA\u2019s Second Worst Month\n\n&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fac23214c1353f0b68d7710f6f7886a1/2eed74513d6bc154-86/s400x600/2540f531fb63ceab611b44ad7e0a2c0165670319.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective\n\n&gt; One month ago today the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We\u2019ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we\u2019ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&amp;P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Picture-4.23.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we\u2019ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?\n\n&gt; \u201cThis remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Market-returns-4.20.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020\n\n&gt; The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy has performed so far this year.\n\n&gt; The \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.\n\n&gt; As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.\n\n&gt; Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far\n\n&gt; We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.\n\n&gt; As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/avgearn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators\n\n&gt; Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity index started off the week coming in at \u20134.19 which was well below estimates of \u20133. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)\n\n&gt; The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&amp;P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.\n\n&gt; In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Other honorable mentions not on this list reporting next week include industrial bell-weather Caterpillar (CAT), stocks likely benefiting from the COVID economy like Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Clorox (CLX), and finally, some travel and leisure stocks like Expedia (EXPE), Royal Caribbean (RCL), United Airlines (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Earnings-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Bounces Right Where It Was Supposed To\n\n&gt; With central banks around the world unleashing waves of liquidity, there have been heightened concerns that one result will be a decline in the purchasing power of our money. For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.\n\n&gt; Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/042320-Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$CBSH** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$CHKP** \n&gt; * **$MRK** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$WHR** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$BP** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$CLX** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$CMS** \n&gt; * **$CNX** \n&gt; * **$APRN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lRp3xer.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Yw1LKpH.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HW4ersg.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KnhCH1m.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XeUrTNF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/20sK5un.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QXrGzmn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tSP1S0Y.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Sn4QllI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DhxQrOU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1CpjzdJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/raeflTF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/43jb0Pu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/axhdXpO.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wiL7F9e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HZkJ2ai.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.

Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald\u2019s are among about 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&amp;P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia\u2019s plan to reopen.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it\u2019s a fundamental story,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said it\u2019s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that\u2019s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. \u201cPeople are watching what\u2019s going on in places like Georgia, but they\u2019re also watching what\u2019s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s really one thing that really matters. It\u2019s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed bazooka\n&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it\u2019s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what\u2019s working and the things that still need to happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tilley said the Fed\u2019s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. \u201cIt looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they\u2019ve come back in,\u201d he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank\u2019s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said this Fed meeting isn\u2019t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they\u2019re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re borrowing from a bank or whether you\u2019re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Economic impact\n&gt; First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.\n*****\n&gt; Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.\n*****\n&gt; The impact of that should show up in Friday\u2019s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,\u201d Tilley said.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings\n&gt; Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.\n*****\n&gt; An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It\u2019s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,\u201d said Golub. \u201cMy estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it\u2019s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year.

To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fac23214c1353f0b68d7710f6f7886a1/2eed74513d6bc154-86/s400x600/2540f531fb63ceab611b44ad7e0a2c0165670319.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective\n\n&gt; One month ago today the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We\u2019ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we\u2019ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&amp;P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Picture-4.23.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we\u2019ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?\n\n&gt; \u201cThis remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Market-returns-4.20.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020\n\n&gt; The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy has performed so far this year.\n\n&gt; The \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.\n\n&gt; As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.\n\n&gt; Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far\n\n&gt; We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.\n\n&gt; As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/avgearn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators\n\n&gt; Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity index started off the week coming in at \u20134.19 which was well below estimates of \u20133. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)\n\n&gt; The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&amp;P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.\n\n&gt; In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Other honorable mentions not on this list reporting next week include industrial bell-weather Caterpillar (CAT), stocks likely benefiting from the COVID economy like Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Clorox (CLX), and finally, some travel and leisure stocks like Expedia (EXPE), Royal Caribbean (RCL), United Airlines (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Earnings-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Bounces Right Where It Was Supposed To\n\n&gt; With central banks around the world unleashing waves of liquidity, there have been heightened concerns that one result will be a decline in the purchasing power of our money. For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.\n\n&gt; Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/042320-Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$CBSH** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$CHKP** \n&gt; * **$MRK** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$WHR** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$BP** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$CLX** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$CMS** \n&gt; * **$CNX** \n&gt; * **$APRN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lRp3xer.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Yw1LKpH.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HW4ersg.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KnhCH1m.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XeUrTNF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/20sK5un.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QXrGzmn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tSP1S0Y.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Sn4QllI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DhxQrOU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1CpjzdJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/raeflTF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/43jb0Pu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/axhdXpO.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wiL7F9e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HZkJ2ai.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.

Securities I  currently own are **bolded** so you can check my bias. :)\n\nWMT - Talk about a ship that has been steady through the storm. I sold all of mine back in 2016, fearing cuts to entitlement programs would essentially cut their workforce by 30% overnight. Those cuts never came, and now I want back in.  Grocery pickup and delivery has been the future for a while, but COVID seems to have fast tracked that transition. IMO, it will remain highly popular post pandemic, Walmart will expand on it, and 5 years from now &gt;70% of grocery sales will be a direct competition between them and **AMZN**. I'm taking this one as soon as the right opening appears, with the expectation of holding it long term.  \n\n**KO** \\- First share I ever bought, never let it go, added to it over the years, and might be adding more tomorrow.  Not much to say here. It's priced well and has a scheduled earnings report before opening bell on Tues.  The recent relative success of consumer markets (WMT, **AMZN**, **TGT**, COST) leads me to think that will be a positive report, and if I see nothing indicating otherwise, I'll try to stock up and ride the wave.  Big fan of **PEP** as well -- more diversified than **KO**, but KFC/Tacobell/PH will probably slow any aggressive gains for a while.\n\n**MSFT** \\- Grain of salt time. This is my favorite holding on the market, bar none. **MSFT** and **AMZN** have essentially held up the whole average during this rebound period. It's all about those beautiful beautiful clouds y'all. (military contracts don't hurt either, see **BA**...) It's always a good time to buy Microsoft. \n\nGOOG/**GOOGL** \\- has a bright future in similar areas to **MSFT**, but I hate companies that live and die by advertisement revenue. For that reason I have a very limited holding in only 1 out of the 2, and I stay away from FB and TWT as well.  ITS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME TO BUY MICROSOFT.\n\nT and **DAL** \\- like Coke, they both have earnings to report this week. I think Delta will produce a decent report which will confuse some who don't fully understand that the pandemic split quarters, and much of the carnage won't be known until the end of Q2. If it does bump up, I'll offload shares and buy back lower in the early summer. **DAL** has the best balance sheet as well as the second best executive team in the whole airline industry, and I don't see it going anywhere. T on the other hand looks to be primed for injury if they report negative earnings.  If they fall back below 26, I'm an AT&amp;T buyer all day long. \n\nNFLX - If it were my money, I'd wait for the (very likely) record high earnings report coming up, ride the wave, and sell high.  I'm not a fan of companies who can't seem to be profitable despite overwhelming popularity. Average NFLX account is accessed by &gt;8 users, but only paid for by 1. New competitors emerging. The whole company model just sketches me out. Go prove me wrong Netflix.... but I'll continue to pass for now.\n\nSNE - Gaming has grown in quarantine, Playstation 5 is set to release in the next 2 months, and the stock still has solid rebound potential from its high. I'm at a solid buy here, and I've never owned it before.... so thats exciting!\n\n**V** and **MC** \\- Every single reputable study shows that the very first debt people default on in a recession is their credit card bill. BE VERY CAREFUL HERE.\n\nTSLA - Volatile, Bullish, Enigmatic.... I have no idea what's happening here.  Tesla fanboy's overwhelming enthusiasm make market predictions hard. I'll buy if it drops below 580 again. Don't own any now. Damn sure wish I did....\n\nOther stuff I like right now - **BA**, **JNJ**, **LOW**, **SAVE**, **TDOC**, MDT, HD, **ABT**\n\nOther stuff I'm neutral on - **PG**, LUV, DIS, **NKE**, SHOP, **AMD**, **Oil stocks** (will likely go even lower next month), and **many many many others**.....\n\nOther stuff I hate right now - **AAPL**, cruise lines, or any company that can't survive another big dip.

I'm at a solid buy here, and I've never owned it before.... so thats exciting!\n\n**V** and **MC** \\- Every single reputable study shows that the very first debt people default on in a recession is their credit card bill. BE VERY CAREFUL HERE.\n\nTSLA - Volatile, Bullish, Enigmatic.... I have no idea what's happening here.  Tesla fanboy's overwhelming enthusiasm make market predictions hard. I'll buy if it drops below 580 again. Don't own any now. Damn sure wish I did....\n\nOther stuff I like right now - **BA**, **JNJ**, **LOW**, **SAVE**, **TDOC**, MDT, HD, **ABT**\n\nOther stuff I'm neutral on - **PG**, LUV, DIS, **NKE**, SHOP, **AMD**, **Oil stocks** (will likely go even lower next month), and **many many many others**.....\n\nOther stuff I hate right now - **AAPL**, cruise lines, or any company that can't survive another big dip. Nobody knows if it's coming. be smart.\n\nDo your thing Reddit, Have a spectacular week, and GOD BLESS AMERICA!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 606209, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Some thoughts going into this week", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g49lz5/some_thoughts_going_into_this_week/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1587306884.0}], [[], false, "HyperInflation2020", null, [], null, "text", "t2_5z5sq2xp", false, false, [], false, false, 1587294855, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g460p6/take_profits_in_your_tech_stocks_now/", {}, "g460p6", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", "discussion", [], "8acd2324-65e6-11e5-a263-122ab0778f8b", "Discussion", "dark", "text", false, false, true, 115, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/g460p6/take_profits_in_your_tech_stocks_now/", false, 6, 1587294856, 1, "This is an objective take on things from a value investing perspective. I\u2019ve been a value investor my whole life. Granted, this hasn\u2019t served me well in the last couple of years. But overall, my value investment strategy has outperformed the market significantly over the years. I make investment decisions based on facts and numbers and hold cheap stocks long-term, regardless of current sentiment, FED buying, etc. This is what Warren Buffett does. I have been watching tech stocks becoming extremely expensive compared to usual over the last two years, so I hope to issue a warning to people investing in this space. \n\nTake ADBE, for example: its price-to-earnings ratio is 50x. A normal stock over a long period of time trades at an average Price-to-Earnings ratio of about 15x. So this is a very expensive stock from a value investing perspective, but they do dominate the market and make good profits. However, there are many so-called \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks in the NASDAQ today that have negligible profits (if at all). Think AMZN, UBER, SNAP, LYFT, and of course, TSLA. AYX is another one, trading on 296x earnings. These \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks trade on the sole basis of future growth, which is then supposed to lead to market domination one day, at which point the company is supposed to start making profits. \n\nSo people are paying eye-watering prices for dominant players like ADBE and MSFT, but they are ALSO paying even more eye-watering prices for \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks which will become profitable \u201cone day\u201d. There is a major flaw in this logic: \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks will never become profitable if the current dominant players continue to be dominant. **They cannot both win**. Profit margins for all tech stocks are currently very elevated, and the sector can only grow at the pace the economy is growing. It\u2019s simply not possible for ALL of these tech stocks to increase their market share and their profits. \n\nAfter it became clear that the US was heading into a recession thanks to COVID, people started piling into these already expensive tech stocks. A big part of the reason why is that tech did well in the previous financial crisis. People want somewhere to \u201chide\u201d from COVID, to wait it out. However, what these people may not have realized is that the situation today is very different to 10 years ago, when the tech sector was relatively un-impacted by the recession. Many of today\u2019s big names, such as AAPL, TSLA, NVDA, are involved in selling luxury items to consumers. This will take a bit hit. Other names such as FB and GOOGL will also take a massive hit, as the economic slowdown impacts online advertising revenue. You can think of FB and GOOGL as the real estate of the internet \u2013 back in 08/09 online retail was too busy expanding from a very low base to be hit by a generalised slowdown \u2013 but now these Tech stocks are too big not to be affected by prevailing economic conditions. The online advertising complex has a similar dichotomy to software. GOOGL and FB make all the profit. AMZN and other retailers are meant to be much more profitable one day \u2013 but that profitability would come at the expense of the online landlords. **Again, it doesn\u2019t make sense for EVERYTHING to be on a high valuation!**\n\nYou might be thinking: the NASDAQ has been exceptionally strong recently. Why don\u2019t I just buy a few stocks and see what happens. What can go wrong? The problem is that when there is a crash, things will go down VERY fast. You will likely not have the opportunity to get out of your stocks once things start going down properly. \n\nMany companies will be reporting their Q1 numbers soon. Many of them will avoid giving guidance for Q2, saying that their future performance is uncertain. However, one thing is certain: Q2 performance will be catastrophic across the board. Companies (especially tech companies that pay their employees in stocks) will try to keep the stock price up for as long as possible. However, they will have to report these bad numbers at some point. We don\u2019t know when the market will lose confidence in the sector as a whole \u2013 it\u2019s not possible for anyone to time this, even Warren Buffett. However, we can be sure that an actual decline in performance is coming, and when the market reacts to this, things may drop faster than you can react. \n\nTL;DR, tech stocks were already expensive pre-COVID, and are not the \u201csafe haven\u201d that some people believe them to be.

It was originally published on April 8.*\n\nAlphabet Inc.\u2019s Google lords over the online-advertising market, which is both a blessing and a curse in the age of coronavirus.\n\nThe core business of Alphabet **GOOGL,** **+2.06%** **GOOG,** **+2.00%** commands roughly 30% of the $110 billion digital-advertising markets worldwide and is expected to maintain that lead in 2021 and beyond, according to eMarketer. YouTube is a big reason why, as it is expected to haul in $9.33 billion in 2020 and $11.4 billion in 2021, according to eMarketer. In February, Alphabet disclosed it brought in $15.1 billion in ads through YouTube in 2019, and $8.9 billion via Google Cloud.\n\nIf there is one company that will initially be hit hardest by ad cutbacks, it\u2019s Google. Up to 40% of its revenue comes from categories hard hit by COVID-19: in-person retail, restaurants, travel, automotive and small businesses. But it is also likely to be the first to rebound because of its market leadership.\n\n**Business in the age of COVID-19:** **Read profiles of how other large companies will be affected by the coronavirus**\n\nGoogle has been here before when it wasn\u2019t named Alphabet. During the recession sparked by the subprime-loan crisis a decade ago, sales remained at single-digit growth for five quarters in a row. Google\u2019s revenue estimates declined at least 15% in 2009 and 2010, with a marginally greater earnings hit, according to an analysis by MKM Partners.\n\nThen again, Google had the field all to itself more than a decade ago, before Facebook Inc. **FB,** **+3.22%**, Snap Inc. **SNAP,** **+9.25%**, and Twitter Inc. **TWTR,** **+8.78%** emerged as online ad rivals.\n\n\u201cBack then, I was told at the time the recovery is quicker than you think it is when you get there, and the strongest companies recover quicker than the weaker ones,\u201d former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said in a Zoom **ZM,** **+3.56%** conference with business executives, investors and media on April 7.\n\nAnalysts seem to agree, painting a picture of short-term pain but a quick recovery for Google.\n\n\u201cWe are modelling a \\[year-over-year\\] decline in Google revenues in Q2 followed by continued acceleration in revenues \\[in the second half\\],\u201d MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni said in an April 3 note. \u201cHowever, we do not expect Google to return to double-digit revenue growth until Q1 \u201921.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put this delicately, use the opportunity of the crisis to reconfigure and ensure the decisions you make now make you stronger when this lifts \u2014 a year or maybe less,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nIn 2008, for example, Google repriced stock options to employees to stabilize its workforce and retain talent.\n\n\u201cIt was the right decision at the time,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nSince the last recession, Google has also acted to diversify its business beyond search ads, with YouTube and Cloud accounting for more than 40% of incremental growth, MKM Partners reported.\n\nAlphabet reports fiscal first-quarter results on April 22.\n\nHow the numbers are changing\n\n**Revenue:** Average analyst expectations for the first quarter were $43.17 billion at the end of 2019, but have declined to $42.08 billion as of April 6. Estimates for Google websites, which account for most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, have declined from $30.32 billion to $29.73 billion in that time period, according to FactSet. For the full year, analysts expect revenue of $181.9 billion.\n\n**Earnings:** Average analyst expectations from FactSet were $12.31 per share at the end of 2019. As of April 6, they were $11.24 per share. For the full year, analysts expect earnings of $48.90 a share.\n\n**Stock movement:** During the first three months of 2020, Class A shares declined 13%. Google crested at $1,519.44 on Feb. 18 and closed at $1,183.19 on April 6.\n\nWhat the company is saying\n\nNot much. Notoriously tight-lipped Alphabet executives haven\u2019t said anything of note \u2014 either in SEC filings, news releases or blog posts \u2014 about the economic impact of coronavirus. What they have shared is mostly about a surge in traffic coursing over its network, prompting it to boost the capacity to handle demands on its network and data centers.\n\n**April 3:** \u201cOur priority now is how to meet the surge in demand,\u201d John Jester, vice president of customer experience at Google Cloud, told MarketWatch in a phone interview.\n\nIn a blog post, Google said traffic on its premium video conferencing property Meet has grown 60% day-over-day and is topping 2 billion minutes a day \u2014 25 times the traffic of a typical day.\n\n**Feb. 4:** Until the last two quarters, Google was conspicuously silent about breaking out revenue figures by product division. During its fiscal fourth quarter, it said YouTube was at $15 billion in annual ad revenue, and Cloud is on a $10 billion revenue run rate.\n\n\u2022 Online advertising is half of the global advertising, and Google has roughly 40% market share of online advertising. The math points toward an inevitable short-term disadvantage to Google, but a speedy recovery because of its clout, according to MKM Partners. \u201cWe expect Google advertising revenues to decelerate from \u2018high teens\u2019 (18% to 20%) during 2019 to 4% in 1Q:20, -1% in 2Q:20, and approx. +4% in 4Q20. We are raising our Google Cloud revenue assumptions as we expect a continued acceleration in the cloud, driven by sales force expansion and healthier end markets.\u201d \u2014 **MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni**, maintained his buy rating while trimming Alphabet\u2019s price target to $1,400 from $1,600 on April 3.\n\n\u2022 \u201cWe expect Google to have a greater near-term disadvantage but also have a faster recovery as pandemic effects reduce... We believe Alphabet will be more resilient vs. Facebook in weathering the advertising decline due to its lower exposure to the \\[small business\\] advertiser base. As a result of these top-line changes, our 2020 GAAP EPS estimate is now $40.56 (vs. prior estimate of $53.47) and our 2021 GAAP EPS is now $54.30 (vs. a prior estimate of $66.\u201d \u2014 **Citi analyst Jason Bazinet**, maintained a buy rating while trimming Alphabet\u2019s price target to $1,400 from $1,700 on April 1", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 587384, "public", "self", "Alphabet in the age of COVID-19: Google braved one recession, and now it\u2019s more diversified", 0, [], "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fxfxv7/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", "all_ads", 6, 1586379879.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "adamjonasbrother", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5wz7ou4w", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1586383479, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fxfxv7/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fxfxv7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/fxfxv7/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1586390327, "score": 0, "selftext": " \n\n# Alphabet in the age of COVID-19: Google braved one recession, and now it\u2019s more diversified\n\nWhile online-ad rivals like Facebook and Twitter were still startups with no revenue to speak of in the last recession, former Google CEO says search giant learned some lessons\n\n*This article is part of a series tracking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on major businesses and will be updated.

Google\u2019s revenue estimates declined at least 15% in 2009 and 2010, with a marginally greater earnings hit, according to an analysis by MKM Partners.\n\nThen again, Google had the field all to itself more than a decade ago, before Facebook Inc. **FB,** **+3.22%**, Snap Inc. **SNAP,** **+9.25%**, and Twitter Inc. **TWTR,** **+8.78%** emerged as online ad rivals.\n\n\u201cBack then, I was told at the time the recovery is quicker than you think it is when you get there, and the strongest companies recover quicker than the weaker ones,\u201d former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said in a Zoom **ZM,** **+3.56%** conference with business executives, investors and media on April 7.\n\nAnalysts seem to agree, painting a picture of short-term pain but a quick recovery for Google.\n\n\u201cWe are modelling a \\[year-over-year\\] decline in Google revenues in Q2 followed by continued acceleration in revenues \\[in the second half\\],\u201d MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni said in an April 3 note. \u201cHowever, we do not expect Google to return to double-digit revenue growth until Q1 \u201921.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put this delicately, use the opportunity of the crisis to reconfigure and ensure the decisions you make now make you stronger when this lifts \u2014 a year or maybe less,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nIn 2008, for example, Google repriced stock options to employees to stabilize its workforce and retain talent.\n\n\u201cIt was the right decision at the time,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nSince the last recession, Google has also acted to diversify its business beyond search ads, with YouTube and Cloud accounting for more than 40% of incremental growth, MKM Partners reported.\n\nAlphabet reports fiscal first-quarter results on April 22.\n\nHow the numbers are changing\n\n**Revenue:** Average analyst expectations for the first quarter were $43.17 billion at the end of 2019, but have declined to $42.08 billion as of April 6. Estimates for Google websites, which account for most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, have declined from $30.32 billion to $29.73 billion in that time period, according to FactSet. For the full year, analysts expect revenue of $181.9 billion.\n\n**Earnings:** Average analyst expectations from FactSet were $12.31 per share at the end of 2019. As of April 6, they were $11.24 per share. For the full year, analysts expect earnings of $48.90 a share.\n\n**Stock movement:** During the first three months of 2020, Class A shares declined 13%. Google crested at $1,519.44 on Feb. 18 and closed at $1,183.19 on April 6.\n\nWhat the company is saying\n\nNot much. Notoriously tight-lipped Alphabet executives haven\u2019t said anything of note \u2014 either in SEC filings, news releases or blog posts \u2014 about the economic impact of coronavirus. What they have shared is mostly about a surge in traffic coursing over its network, prompting it to boost the capacity to handle demands on its network and data centers.\n\n**April 3:** \u201cOur priority now is how to meet the surge in demand,\u201d John Jester, vice president of customer experience at Google Cloud, told MarketWatch in a phone interview.\n\nIn a blog post, Google said traffic on its premium video conferencing property Meet has grown 60% day-over-day and is topping 2 billion minutes a day \u2014 25 times the traffic of a typical day.\n\n**Feb. 4:** Until the last two quarters, Google was conspicuously silent about breaking out revenue figures by product division. During its fiscal fourth quarter, it said YouTube was at $15 billion in annual ad revenue, and Cloud is on a $10 billion revenue run rate.\n\n\u2022 Online advertising is half of the global advertising, and Google has roughly 40% market share of online advertising. The math points toward an inevitable short-term disadvantage to Google, but a speedy recovery because of its clout, according to MKM Partners. \u201cWe expect Google advertising revenues to decelerate from \u2018high teens\u2019 (18% to 20%) during 2019 to 4% in 1Q:20, -1% in 2Q:20, and approx. +4% in 4Q20. We are raising our Google Cloud revenue assumptions as we expect a continued acceleration in the cloud, driven by sales force expansion and healthier end markets.\u201d \u2014 **MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni**, maintained his buy rating while trimming Alphabet\u2019s price target to $1,400 from $1,600 on April 3.\n\n\u2022 \u201cWe expect Google to have a greater near-term disadvantage but also have a faster recovery as pandemic effects reduce... We believe Alphabet will be more resilient vs. Facebook in weathering the advertising decline due to its lower exposure to the \\[small business\\] advertiser base. As a result of these top-line changes, our 2020 GAAP EPS estimate is now $40.56 (vs. prior estimate of $53.47) and our 2021 GAAP EPS is now $54.30 (vs. a prior estimate of $66.\u201d \u2014 **Citi analyst Jason Bazinet**, maintained a buy rating while trimming Alphabet\u2019s price target to $1,400 from $1,700 on April 1", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 587384, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Alphabet in the age of COVID-19: Google braved one recession, and now it\u2019s more diversified", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fxfxv7/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1586379879.0}], [[], false, "adamjonasbrother", null, [], null, "text", "t2_5wz7ou4w", false, false, [], false, false, 1586383360, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fxfwk4/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", {}, "fxfwk4", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 0, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/fxfwk4/alphabet_in_the_age_of_covid19_google_braved_one/", false, 6, 1586390180, 0, " \n\n# Alphabet in the age of COVID-19: Google braved one recession, and now it\u2019s more diversified\n\nWhile online-ad rivals like Facebook and Twitter were still startups with no revenue to speak of in the last recession, former Google CEO says search giant learned some lessons\n\n*This article is part of a series tracking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on major businesses and will be updated.

It was originally published on April 8.*\n\nAlphabet Inc.\u2019s Google lords over the online-advertising market, which is both a blessing and a curse in the age of coronavirus.\n\nThe core business of Alphabet **GOOGL,** **+2.06%** **GOOG,** **+2.00%** commands roughly 30% of the $110 billion digital-advertising markets worldwide and is expected to maintain that lead in 2021 and beyond, according to eMarketer. YouTube is a big reason why, as it is expected to haul in $9.33 billion in 2020 and $11.4 billion in 2021, according to eMarketer. In February, Alphabet disclosed it brought in $15.1 billion in ads through YouTube in 2019, and $8.9 billion via Google Cloud.\n\nIf there is one company that will initially be hit hardest by ad cutbacks, it\u2019s Google. Up to 40% of its revenue comes from categories hard hit by COVID-19: in-person retail, restaurants, travel, automotive and small businesses. But it is also likely to be the first to rebound because of its market leadership.\n\n**Business in the age of COVID-19:** **Read profiles of how other large companies will be affected by the coronavirus**\n\nGoogle has been here before when it wasn\u2019t named Alphabet. During the recession sparked by the subprime-loan crisis a decade ago, sales remained at single-digit growth for five quarters in a row. Google\u2019s revenue estimates declined at least 15% in 2009 and 2010, with a marginally greater earnings hit, according to an analysis by MKM Partners.\n\nThen again, Google had the field all to itself more than a decade ago, before Facebook Inc. **FB,** **+3.22%**, Snap Inc. **SNAP,** **+9.25%**, and Twitter Inc. **TWTR,** **+8.78%** emerged as online ad rivals.\n\n\u201cBack then, I was told at the time the recovery is quicker than you think it is when you get there, and the strongest companies recover quicker than the weaker ones,\u201d former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said in a Zoom **ZM,** **+3.56%** conference with business executives, investors and media on April 7.\n\nAnalysts seem to agree, painting a picture of short-term pain but a quick recovery for Google.\n\n\u201cWe are modelling a \\[year-over-year\\] decline in Google revenues in Q2 followed by continued acceleration in revenues \\[in the second half\\],\u201d MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni said in an April 3 note. \u201cHowever, we do not expect Google to return to double-digit revenue growth until Q1 \u201921.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put this delicately, use the opportunity of the crisis to reconfigure and ensure the decisions you make now make you stronger when this lifts \u2014 a year or maybe less,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nIn 2008, for example, Google repriced stock options to employees to stabilize its workforce and retain talent.\n\n\u201cIt was the right decision at the time,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nSince the last recession, Google has also acted to diversify its business beyond search ads, with YouTube and Cloud accounting for more than 40% of incremental growth, MKM Partners reported.\n\nAlphabet reports fiscal first-quarter results on April 22.\n\nHow the numbers are changing\n\n**Revenue:** Average analyst expectations for the first quarter were $43.17 billion at the end of 2019, but have declined to $42.08 billion as of April 6. Estimates for Google websites, which account for most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, have declined from $30.32 billion to $29.73 billion in that time period, according to FactSet. For the full year, analysts expect revenue of $181.9 billion.\n\n**Earnings:** Average analyst expectations from FactSet were $12.31 per share at the end of 2019. As of April 6, they were $11.24 per share. For the full year, analysts expect earnings of $48.90 a share.\n\n**Stock movement:** During the first three months of 2020, Class A shares declined 13%. Google crested at $1,519.44 on Feb. 18 and closed at $1,183.19 on April 6.\n\nWhat the company is saying\n\nNot much. Notoriously tight-lipped Alphabet executives haven\u2019t said anything of note \u2014 either in SEC filings, news releases or blog posts \u2014 about the economic impact of coronavirus. What they have shared is mostly about a surge in traffic coursing over its network, prompting it to boost the capacity to handle demands on its network and data centers.\n\n**April 3:** \u201cOur priority now is how to meet the surge in demand,\u201d John Jester, vice president of customer experience at Google Cloud, told MarketWatch in a phone interview.\n\nIn a blog post, Google said traffic on its premium video conferencing property Meet has grown 60% day-over-day and is topping 2 billion minutes a day \u2014 25 times the traffic of a typical day.\n\n**Feb. 4:** Until the last two quarters, Google was conspicuously silent about breaking out revenue figures by product division.

Welcome to Wednesday. Here is your stock market news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Wednesday, March 25th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-25-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures saw wild swings Wednesday between strong gains and modest losses. Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday\u2019s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month\u2019s record highs.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to \u201cstabilize key national industries,\u201d according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is \u201cvery special\u201d to him. The president added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.\u201d He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be \u201cbased on hard facts and data\u201d and will be \u201cgrounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy\u2019s more than 69,100 cases are second only China\u2019s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy\u2019s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles\u2019 household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Target, one of the retailers that\u2019s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it\u2019s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/fSZQmSW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/riM2wSU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Lbg1Yjq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($PAYX $WGO $MYOS $CYRN $ESLT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wsKnBCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ksMrAMO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/loxsY7U.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bn1Leu6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/itDRVWv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/VE62GJ4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/j02oFK1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1VSsvSc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hYpoP09.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* BA\n* AAL\n* RCL\n* SPY\n* DAL\n* JNUG\n* NCLH\n* DIS\n* UAL\n* ZM\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-target-nike-facebook-apple-peloton-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Target (TGT)** \u2013 The retailer joined the ranks of those withdrawing financial guidance, due to the uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.

Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday\u2019s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month\u2019s record highs.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to \u201cstabilize key national industries,\u201d according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is \u201cvery special\u201d to him. The president added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.\u201d He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be \u201cbased on hard facts and data\u201d and will be \u201cgrounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy\u2019s more than 69,100 cases are second only China\u2019s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy\u2019s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles\u2019 household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Target, one of the retailers that\u2019s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it\u2019s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/fSZQmSW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/riM2wSU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Lbg1Yjq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($PAYX $WGO $MYOS $CYRN $ESLT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wsKnBCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ksMrAMO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/loxsY7U.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bn1Leu6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/itDRVWv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/VE62GJ4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/j02oFK1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1VSsvSc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hYpoP09.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* BA\n* AAL\n* RCL\n* SPY\n* DAL\n* JNUG\n* NCLH\n* DIS\n* UAL\n* ZM\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-target-nike-facebook-apple-peloton-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Target (TGT)** \u2013 The retailer joined the ranks of those withdrawing financial guidance, due to the uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.

stocks)\n\nI think Facebook should make an API for various gov agencies in different countries to flag posts/content on Facebook and specify which local law or Facebook policy is being violated.

The S&amp;P 500 fell just about 1% for the week, amid fears the virus could lead to slower growth not only in China, but across the globe.\n*****\n&gt; Those concerns could continue to spook markets in the coming week, but stocks should be buffeted by the Fed\u2019s anticipated commitment to low rates and its current Treasury bill buying program. The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize that the Fed remains on a neutral policy path and that would only change if there was a significant change in the economic outlook.\n*****\n&gt; There are also some major earnings reports, including from Apple, which hit an all-time high Friday morning before closing lower with the broader market. It could have a big impact on sentiment and help influence trading across the technology sector.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, and Treasury yields have been sinking on worries about the new virus. The 10-year yield sunk to a Nov. 1 low of 1.68% and investors drove gold prices higher in a flight-to-safety trade.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s overshadowing everything, and what the market is looking for is that the Chinese are containing it, and the spread is minimal,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe derivative of all of this is what does it do to growth? Traders and investors are hoping the stimulus that has been introduced into the Chinese economy is going to take hold, and this is not going to halt that turnaround.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the market has been looking for an excuse to pull back. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,295, off 1%, but it is still up about 2% for the year so far.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could see going into the weekend the 10-year Treasury yield is down, gold is higher, the market is in a text book defensive state,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cWe had a market that was poised for a bout of profit-taking and this is it.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings roll out\n&gt; There are more than 135 S&amp;P companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, with a heavy focus on technology, industrials and consumer stocks. Apple reports Tuesday, and Microsoft and Facebook are Wednesday. Boeing and General Electric report Wednesday, while McDonald\u2019s releases results Wednesday. On Friday, big oil reports with ExxonMobil and Chevron expected.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings reports so far have been mostly better than expected, with 68.2% of companies beating earnings per share estimates, according to Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to be down about a half percent for the fourth quarter, based on actual reports and estimates of companies yet to report.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cComing into any earnings season with stocks at all time highs is fraught with peril,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s precarious because you have the opportunity for outsized moves if you miss earnings, revenues or guidance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said companies may be able to give a better indication of the future, now that there\u2019s a first phase trade deal between the U.S. and China. He said markets will also be looking for guidance from China and elsewhere on whether the virus appears to be containable or not.\n*****\n&gt;#  Fed is big story but won\u2019t say much\nThe Federal Reserve is not likely to say much has changed in its outlook, except that it\u2019s last three interest rate cuts may have helped the economy and financial conditions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe big news is just talk on the balance sheet. I think that\u2019s going to be the key messaging,\u201d said Jim Caron, portfolio strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \u201cI think the data has been okay. There\u2019s really nothing new there. The only thing that\u2019s really new or interesting is going to be what\u2019s going on with the balance sheet.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has been buying about $60 billion in Treasury bills each month to expand its balance sheet, ending a program where it was shrinking the balance sheet. The Fed is adding reserves to end a problem in the repo market, which is basically the plumbing of the financial markets where institutions go to get short term cash.\n*****\n&gt; Many traders believe the program is adding liquidity to markets, and therefore driving investors into stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Mark Cabana, head of short rate strategy at BofA Securiteis, said the Fed is not changing its benchmark fed funds target rate, but the fixed income market has been expecting the Fed to make a technical adjustment to another rate. He said the fed funds rate, trading at about 1.55%, has come to the lower end of the Fed\u2019s target range of 1.5 to 1.75%.\n*****\n&gt; For that reason it is likely to raise the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. \u201cThe intent is to affirm the bottom end of the Fed\u2019s target range, \u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the technical move, they \u201cmay be will provide a little more guidance on what it would take to vote rates one way or the other,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Economic data\n&gt; There\u2019s an important data calendar in the coming week, including the first look at the fourth quarter\u2019s gross domestic product on Thursday. Personal income and spending data is Friday, and that includes the personal consumption expenditure inflation deflator, watched by the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; New home sales could continue the string of positive news in housing, when they are released Monday, and there are durable goods Tuesday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Jh9TsGk.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PC0Wzg3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HbDh9Vc.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/mbOqHih.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vvAjRp1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H2E0IGA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EzxkRa0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D9nkFqV.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BhyYBqu.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ueyg2Ui.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xc2z54D.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/mFxq4a0.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XjxVPqW.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/uiduXrQ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Solid January Starts Not Rare, February Could Be Tepid\n\n&gt; Bullish sentiment is running high and why not. A new decade has begun, January has been bucking the recent trend of volatile performance and the market is trading at or near all-time record highs. Big round numbers like 29000, 3300 and 9000 are also emotionally satisfying. Our Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days indicators were both positive and the market is well on its way to completing a historically bullish January Trifecta. A positive January Barometer is all that remains to complete the January Trifecta.\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close DJIA was up 2.3% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was up 2.79% and NASDAQ stood at 4.44%. Although these gains are above average, they are actually not all that uncommon by the thirteenth trading day of the New Year. Since 1901 (119 years), DJIA has been up 2.3% or more on the thirteenth trading day 33 times before this year. DJIA\u2019s largest gain on the thirteenth trading day was 11.4% in 1976 (+17.9% for the full-year). S&amp;P 500 has equaled or exceeded 2.79% on the thirteenth trading day 26 times since 1930 while NASDAQ has bested 4.44% 15 times since 1971. Depending on index, gains equal to or greater than this year come about approximately once every 3.3 to 3.6 years. 2012 was the last election year where all three indexes were up more on the thirteenth trading day than this year.\n\n&gt; In the following Seasonal Patten Charts of DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, we compare 2020 (as of yesterday\u2019s close) to All Years and Election Years. Here it is clear that the market has gotten off to a solid start with well above average gains so far. Throughout 2019, the market tracked its historical patterns quite closely which suggests some mean reversion could occur this February as the month has been historically tepid for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40266be6ec0ea5254acf28b7b6d1382f/9bf6345fd07e4a41-a7/s500x750/adacad5fc51e44798ccb9e3f4f840aeb1cf88bad.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/64ed8994efe5e18c82cdb0e191844380/9bf6345fd07e4a41-00/s500x750/da09894ccf7e9c51f7a3814ee73a4a9e65fefeca.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/71145fa04257eb5aad5eec7945276aa7/9bf6345fd07e4a41-02/s500x750/48e6c017697fc7e130ffcdabcb46093f3c28522b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Another Look At Election Years\n\n&gt; Last week in our LPL Research blog, we took a closer look at how stocks have performed during an election year. We found that since 1940, the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower during an election year when an incumbent president has been up for reelection.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve had many requests to look more into election years, so we thought we\u2019d take another look at this impactful year.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500\u2019s track record for reelection years has been impressive, but its average path during these years has been quite interesting, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. In ten reelection years since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 on average has barely budged from February through June, before breaking out in the second half of the year.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks actually have traded in a tight range from February through June during election years, with the big rally taking place during the second half of the year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reelection-012220.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; From a quarterly view, the S&amp;P 500 has historically posted modest returns in the four quarters of an election year, but the benchmark has been higher an impressive 82% of the time in the fourth quarter of all election years. That\u2019s one of the best track records of any quarter in the four-year presidential cycle.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/quarterly-return-012220.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Recession Watch Update\n\n&gt; As the economic expansion caps its first decade, we thought it\u2019d be a good time to check on LPL Research\u2019s leading indicators in our Recession Watch Dashboard.\n\n&gt; As you can see in our latest update and in the LPL Chart of the Day, the overall view hasn\u2019t changed much. We believe we are in the later stages of this economic expansion, but we still see little threat of imminent recession. The current expansion is the longest on record, at 126 months, but the economy has grown at a slow and steady rate. We believe this measured pace, along with supportive fiscal policy, has contributed to this cycle\u2019s continued durability.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/012120-recession-blog.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; In the fourth quarter, the needle moved in different directions for two of our five forecasters:\n\n&gt; We removed the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve from On Watch status as the spread between the 3-month and 10-year yields moved back into positive territory. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields also climbed to an 18-month high following the Federal Reserve rate cuts. Going back to 1955, a yield curve inversion (long-term yields falling below short-term yields) has preceded each of the nine recessions. It\u2019s important to note, however, that parts of the curve flickered between positive and inverted territory several times before the actual recession occurred.\n\n&gt; We added Market Valuations to On Watch status, as the S&amp;P 500 Index trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio rose near cycle highs. The P/E ratio is now comfortably above our 2020 target of 18.75. With the S&amp;P 500 surpassing the upper end of our year-end fair value target of 3,300, we are watching closely to see if earnings growth is strong enough to justify these elevated valuations. The low interest-rate and inflation environment continue to be strong tailwinds for market valuations.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe remain optimistic of continued, albeit possibly slower, economic growth in the United States in the coming year, bolstered by recent progress on the U.S.-China trade deal,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile we continue to monitor the indicators closely, at the present time, we see only a modest chance of recession starting within the next year.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 24th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.26.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$PYPL** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$DHI** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$UTX** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$S** \n&gt; * **$NURO** \n&gt; * **$HMST** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$XLNX** \n&gt; * **$ARNC** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$BX** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$GD** \n&gt; * **$PHM** \n&gt; * **$NVR** \n&gt; * **$PII** \n&gt; * **$SALT** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$NOW** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$NUE** \n&gt; * **$ALK** \n&gt; * **$PLUG** \n&gt; * **$MPC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BhyYBqu.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/LryC0HR.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/UJ0XUOn.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4WIKCya.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZqdHlAC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uNAMC1F.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yyFyqKK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nGue9UL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D7CJT4Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gAvYCNR.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RKvojKG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1aQuGJs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.31.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5YpKIPM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.31.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/r0KJmsx.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Apple, Inc. $318.31\n&gt; **Apple, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 27th, 2020.\n\n# **After virus scare, markets look to Fed rate policy to keep stock rally going  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/after-virus-scare-markets-look-to-fed-rate-policy-to-keep-rally-going.html)**\n*****\n&gt; With stocks coming off their first losing week of the year, investors will be looking for the Federal Reserve to soothe markets by reaffirming its position that interest rates will be low for a long time into the future.\n*****\n&gt; The outbreak of the coronavirus in China in the past week took the steam out of a market that has been repeatedly rallying to new highs since December. The S&amp;P 500 fell just about 1% for the week, amid fears the virus could lead to slower growth not only in China, but across the globe.\n*****\n&gt; Those concerns could continue to spook markets in the coming week, but stocks should be buffeted by the Fed\u2019s anticipated commitment to low rates and its current Treasury bill buying program. The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize that the Fed remains on a neutral policy path and that would only change if there was a significant change in the economic outlook.\n*****\n&gt; There are also some major earnings reports, including from Apple, which hit an all-time high Friday morning before closing lower with the broader market. It could have a big impact on sentiment and help influence trading across the technology sector.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, and Treasury yields have been sinking on worries about the new virus. The 10-year yield sunk to a Nov. 1 low of 1.68% and investors drove gold prices higher in a flight-to-safety trade.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s overshadowing everything, and what the market is looking for is that the Chinese are containing it, and the spread is minimal,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe derivative of all of this is what does it do to growth? Traders and investors are hoping the stimulus that has been introduced into the Chinese economy is going to take hold, and this is not going to halt that turnaround.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the market has been looking for an excuse to pull back. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,295, off 1%, but it is still up about 2% for the year so far.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could see going into the weekend the 10-year Treasury yield is down, gold is higher, the market is in a text book defensive state,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cWe had a market that was poised for a bout of profit-taking and this is it.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings roll out\n&gt; There are more than 135 S&amp;P companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, with a heavy focus on technology, industrials and consumer stocks. Apple reports Tuesday, and Microsoft and Facebook are Wednesday. Boeing and General Electric report Wednesday, while McDonald\u2019s releases results Wednesday. On Friday, big oil reports with ExxonMobil and Chevron expected.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings reports so far have been mostly better than expected, with 68.2% of companies beating earnings per share estimates, according to Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to be down about a half percent for the fourth quarter, based on actual reports and estimates of companies yet to report.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cComing into any earnings season with stocks at all time highs is fraught with peril,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s precarious because you have the opportunity for outsized moves if you miss earnings, revenues or guidance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said companies may be able to give a better indication of the future, now that there\u2019s a first phase trade deal between the U.S. and China. He said markets will also be looking for guidance from China and elsewhere on whether the virus appears to be containable or not.\n*****\n&gt;#  Fed is big story but won\u2019t say much\nThe Federal Reserve is not likely to say much has changed in its outlook, except that it\u2019s last three interest rate cuts may have helped the economy and financial conditions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe big news is just talk on the balance sheet. I think that\u2019s going to be the key messaging,\u201d said Jim Caron, portfolio strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \u201cI think the data has been okay. There\u2019s really nothing new there. The only thing that\u2019s really new or interesting is going to be what\u2019s going on with the balance sheet.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has been buying about $60 billion in Treasury bills each month to expand its balance sheet, ending a program where it was shrinking the balance sheet. The Fed is adding reserves to end a problem in the repo market, which is basically the plumbing of the financial markets where institutions go to get short term cash.\n*****\n&gt; Many traders believe the program is adding liquidity to markets, and therefore driving investors into stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Mark Cabana, head of short rate strategy at BofA Securiteis, said the Fed is not changing its benchmark fed funds target rate, but the fixed income market has been expecting the Fed to make a technical adjustment to another rate. He said the fed funds rate, trading at about 1.55%, has come to the lower end of the Fed\u2019s target range of 1.5 to 1.75%.\n*****\n&gt; For that reason it is likely to raise the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. \u201cThe intent is to affirm the bottom end of the Fed\u2019s target range, \u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the technical move, they \u201cmay be will provide a little more guidance on what it would take to vote rates one way or the other,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Economic data\n&gt; There\u2019s an important data calendar in the coming week, including the first look at the fourth quarter\u2019s gross domestic product on Thursday. Personal income and spending data is Friday, and that includes the personal consumption expenditure inflation deflator, watched by the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; New home sales could continue the string of positive news in housing, when they are released Monday, and there are durable goods Tuesday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Jh9TsGk.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PC0Wzg3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HbDh9Vc.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/mbOqHih.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vvAjRp1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H2E0IGA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EzxkRa0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D9nkFqV.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BhyYBqu.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ueyg2Ui.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xc2z54D.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/mFxq4a0.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XjxVPqW.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/uiduXrQ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Solid January Starts Not Rare, February Could Be Tepid\n\n&gt; Bullish sentiment is running high and why not. A new decade has begun, January has been bucking the recent trend of volatile performance and the market is trading at or near all-time record highs. Big round numbers like 29000, 3300 and 9000 are also emotionally satisfying. Our Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days indicators were both positive and the market is well on its way to completing a historically bullish January Trifecta. A positive January Barometer is all that remains to complete the January Trifecta.\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close DJIA was up 2.3% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was up 2.79% and NASDAQ stood at 4.44%. Although these gains are above average, they are actually not all that uncommon by the thirteenth trading day of the New Year. Since 1901 (119 years), DJIA has been up 2.3% or more on the thirteenth trading day 33 times before this year. DJIA\u2019s largest gain on the thirteenth trading day was 11.4% in 1976 (+17.9% for the full-year). S&amp;P 500 has equaled or exceeded 2.79% on the thirteenth trading day 26 times since 1930 while NASDAQ has bested 4.44% 15 times since 1971. Depending on index, gains equal to or greater than this year come about approximately once every 3.3 to 3.6 years. 2012 was the last election year where all three indexes were up more on the thirteenth trading day than this year.\n\n&gt; In the following Seasonal Patten Charts of DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, we compare 2020 (as of yesterday\u2019s close) to All Years and Election Years. Here it is clear that the market has gotten off to a solid start with well above average gains so far. Throughout 2019, the market tracked its historical patterns quite closely which suggests some mean reversion could occur this February as the month has been historically tepid for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40266be6ec0ea5254acf28b7b6d1382f/9bf6345fd07e4a41-a7/s500x750/adacad5fc51e44798ccb9e3f4f840aeb1cf88bad.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/64ed8994efe5e18c82cdb0e191844380/9bf6345fd07e4a41-00/s500x750/da09894ccf7e9c51f7a3814ee73a4a9e65fefeca.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/71145fa04257eb5aad5eec7945276aa7/9bf6345fd07e4a41-02/s500x750/48e6c017697fc7e130ffcdabcb46093f3c28522b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Another Look At Election Years\n\n&gt; Last week in our LPL Research blog, we took a closer look at how stocks have performed during an election year. We found that since 1940, the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower during an election year when an incumbent president has been up for reelection.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve had many requests to look more into election years, so we thought we\u2019d take another look at this impactful year.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500\u2019s track record for reelection years has been impressive, but its average path during these years has been quite interesting, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. In ten reelection years since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 on average has barely budged from February through June, before breaking out in the second half of the year.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks actually have traded in a tight range from February through June during election years, with the big rally taking place during the second half of the year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reelection-012220.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; From a quarterly view, the S&amp;P 500 has historically posted modest returns in the four quarters of an election year, but the benchmark has been higher an impressive 82% of the time in the fourth quarter of all election years. That\u2019s one of the best track records of any quarter in the four-year presidential cycle.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/quarterly-return-012220.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Recession Watch Update\n\n&gt; As the economic expansion caps its first decade, we thought it\u2019d be a good time to check on LPL Research\u2019s leading indicators in our Recession Watch Dashboard.\n\n&gt; As you can see in our latest update and in the LPL Chart of the Day, the overall view hasn\u2019t changed much. We believe we are in the later stages of this economic expansion, but we still see little threat of imminent recession. The current expansion is the longest on record, at 126 months, but the economy has grown at a slow and steady rate. We believe this measured pace, along with supportive fiscal policy, has contributed to this cycle\u2019s continued durability.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/012120-recession-blog.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; In the fourth quarter, the needle moved in different directions for two of our five forecasters:\n\n&gt; We removed the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve from On Watch status as the spread between the 3-month and 10-year yields moved back into positive territory. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields also climbed to an 18-month high following the Federal Reserve rate cuts. Going back to 1955, a yield curve inversion (long-term yields falling below short-term yields) has preceded each of the nine recessions. It\u2019s important to note, however, that parts of the curve flickered between positive and inverted territory several times before the actual recession occurred.\n\n&gt; We added Market Valuations to On Watch status, as the S&amp;P 500 Index trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio rose near cycle highs. The P/E ratio is now comfortably above our 2020 target of 18.75. With the S&amp;P 500 surpassing the upper end of our year-end fair value target of 3,300, we are watching closely to see if earnings growth is strong enough to justify these elevated valuations. The low interest-rate and inflation environment continue to be strong tailwinds for market valuations.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe remain optimistic of continued, albeit possibly slower, economic growth in the United States in the coming year, bolstered by recent progress on the U.S.-China trade deal,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile we continue to monitor the indicators closely, at the present time, we see only a modest chance of recession starting within the next year.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 24th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.26.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$PYPL** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$DHI** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$UTX** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$S** \n&gt; * **$NURO** \n&gt; * **$HMST** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$XLNX** \n&gt; * **$ARNC** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$BX** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$GD** \n&gt; * **$PHM** \n&gt; * **$NVR** \n&gt; * **$PII** \n&gt; * **$SALT** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$NOW** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$NUE** \n&gt; * **$ALK** \n&gt; * **$PLUG** \n&gt; * **$MPC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BhyYBqu.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/LryC0HR.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/UJ0XUOn.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4WIKCya.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZqdHlAC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uNAMC1F.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yyFyqKK.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nGue9UL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D7CJT4Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gAvYCNR.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RKvojKG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1aQuGJs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.31.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5YpKIPM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.31.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/r0KJmsx.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Apple, Inc. $318.31\n&gt; **Apple, Inc.

(CNBC)\n* The direction of the Dow, which closed lower Tuesday on concerns about rising U.S.-Iranian tensions before the airstrikes, could be swayed by the ADP\u2019s December report on private sector employment this morning.

(CNBC)\n* United Airlines (UAL) will take a $90 million charge against fourth-quarter earnings, due to Hong Kong disruptions from ongoing anti-government protests. United said the protests have reduced demand for travel to Hong Kong. (Reuters)\n* Fugitive ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn\u2019s lawyers attacked the auto maker this morning, before he was scheduled to hold a highly-anticipated news conference, accusing Nissan of using a \u201cflawed, biased\u201d internal probe to engineer his arrest.

There are 49 analysts who cover the shares, and 47 of them are positive, with two neutral, according to FactSet. Only Alibaba Group Holding of China and ICICI Bank of India boast more endorsements.\n\nAnd after a record-setting run-up, Amazon\u2019s stock isn\u2019t obviously inviting. A $1,000 stake at the close of the stock\u2019s first day of trading in 1997 has turned into more than $950,000. The shares today, at $1,875, go for 69 times projected 2020 earnings.\n\nStill, buy Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN). The stock price looks sensible when compared with free cash flow, which is swelling quickly. Some growth initiatives are only now paying off. Don\u2019t expect a 35% gain this year, as Amazon has averaged, compounded, since going public. But don\u2019t rule it out, either.\n\nAmazon\u2019s reputation for operating near break-even has long been outdated. Founder Jeff Bezos has emphasized free cash flow over accounting earnings from the start, and Amazon has generated free cash since 2002. The company has tended to invest much of that cash for growth, and the result is that earnings have been positive only since 2014, and only meaningfully so since 2018. Now the numbers are reaching escape velocity.\n\nWhen 2019\u2019s results are released, Wall Street expects Amazon to report that revenue increased by 20%, to $279.1 billion; that earnings rose slightly, to $10.4 billion; and that free cash flow ballooned by 28%, to $24.9 billion. In 2020, free cash flow is expected to expand even faster, by 36%, to $34 billion.\n\nWithin five years, the consensus view is that Amazon will become the biggest free cash generator in America, passing some companies that aren\u2019t exactly standing still, like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). The simplest reason is that Amazon\u2019s investment spending can\u2019t keep up with its growth rate forever.\n\nAmazon launched Prime in 2005, with its free two-day shipping for members, and vast opportunities for the company to put capital to work building speedier infrastructure. Not long after, Amazon Web Services went into cloud computing, another path for investment. Both ventures have proved to be lucrative, with Prime spurring increased spending by shoppers, and AWS yielding generous profit margins.\n\nLast year, Amazon said that it would spend to shorten free Prime shipping to a single day. There are early signs of that paying off, too. Cowen analyst John Blackledge estimates that Prime membership grew 13% during the fourth quarter, versus a year earlier. That compares with 3% growth a year ago and would be the third straight quarter of acceleration.\n\nNow, consider another of Amazon\u2019s growth initiatives: advertising. A recent search for \u201cmen\u2019s tennis rackets\u201d on Amazon.com yielded editorial recommendations and a racket listing labeled \u201cAmazon\u2019s Choice.\u201d But nothing was more prominently displayed than the three sponsored racket listings near the top\u2014except for the paid ad for portable nets just above them.\n\nAdvertising doesn\u2019t require vast investments in fleets and data farms, and it looks like another boon for Amazon\u2019s growth. Ad revenue will rise 36%, to $17.6 billion, in 2020, and by 2025 will top $46 billion, predicts Cowen\u2019s Blackledge. Assuming a 35% operating margin for the business, he estimates that advertising and AWS will together account for 90% of operating income this year.\n\nThat has important implications for shareholders. First, it bodes well for the competitiveness of a store when it doesn\u2019t have to rely on its retail margins for the bulk of profits. Second, the advertising ramp provides another rich source of funds to invest in growth. Third, with Amazon passing the anniversary of its spending boost for Prime one-day, it is unclear that it will need that extra spending. As things stand, growth in capital expenditures is expected to decelerate from over 25% last year, to 16% this year, to under 10% in 2021.\n\nAmong 10 analysts who have estimated Amazon\u2019s free cash flow out to 2021, the lowest says $32.7 billion, the highest says $57.5 billion, and the average is $43.7 billion. Out to 2024, there are only three estimates, averaging $82.8 billion. Apple, in comparison, is expected to produce close to $63 billion in free cash during its current fiscal year through September.\n\nIf distant estimates for Amazon are feasible, or even if they are only moderately overblown, the stock could continue outperforming. At less than 30 times estimated 2020 free cash flow, it is cheaper than the shares of Visa (V), Nike (NKE), or McDonald\u2019s (MCD). From here, 20% annual gains for the next three years could leave the stock priced at a humbler 25 times free cash flow.\n\nA government crackdown against powerful tech titans is a risk, but Amazon may have a better \u201cwho me?\u201d defense than some of the others. Its market share in the public cloud is less than half, and falling, as Microsoft and others catch up. In e-commerce, more than half of its sales are from third-party merchants who pay to use its services. And in online advertising, it\u2019s a pipsqueak next to Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).\n\nAll told, Amazon is popular with stockpickers for good reason.
