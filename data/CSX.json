I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 13th, 2020.\n\n# **Trade deal and earnings season could shape the market\u2019s next moves  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/trade-deal-and-earnings-season-could-shape-the-markets-next-moves.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The stock market\u2019s race to new highs could be put to the test in the coming week by two events \u2014 the signing of a phase one trade deal with China and the start of corporate earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have been gaining steadily since it became clear late last year that the U.S. and China reached a truce and would agree to a phase one deal, rolling back some tariffs and avoiding new ones. But details of that deal have never been made clear, so markets will be focused on any information that will clarify how it will be implemented and what checks and balances there are to ensure compliance.\n*****\n&gt; The market has also reached a lofty premium that could be challenged if earnings disappoint, though analysts widely expect to see the majority of companies able to beat lowered expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Banks are first up with J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo releasing earnings Tuesday, and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs reporting on Wednesday. Earnings could be a slight positive for the market, analysts say.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think earnings are going to be a good component,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cCompanies have lowered the bar enough to where I think most of the companies will easily step over it, and we\u2019ll all have a sigh of relief that the earnings this quarter won\u2019t be as bad as it could have been. It won\u2019 be strong. We\u2019ve seen revisions across all of the sectors come down.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; According to Refinitiv, fourth quarter earnings are expected to be down 0.6%, based on results of companies that have already reported and estimates for others that have not.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks started out the past week worried about a blowup in the Middle East, after the U.S. killed Iran\u2019s top general. But by midweek, tensions dissipated and stocks were higher. On Friday, stocks sold off again, after a lackluster jobs report, though the Dow briefly topped 29,000 for the first time. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.9% for the week, at 3,265, and the Dow was off 0.7% at 28,823.\n*****\n&gt; The China trade deal is expected to be signed on Wednesday, and while it may be a nonevent, it has the potential for surprises. The deal most likely will be seen as a positive, but it is not expected to do much to curb technology transfers, which are expected to be part of the next phase discussions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf the deal is more watered down than anticipated, if there\u2019s skepticism about how China will adhere to its promises\u201d it could be negative, Arone said. \u201cThere\u2019s skepticism already. If there\u2019s something in the details that suggest doubt about how are we going to police this or how are we going to enforce this, I think that could cause markets to move some.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group said he thinks the market has moved past the trade news. \u201cI think they\u2019ll try to emphasize some IP protection. I honestly think people have already moved on,\u201d he said. President Donald Trump has also lowered expectations by noting that the next phase of the deal would not come until after the election.\n*****\n&gt;# Economy\n&gt; Markets also will focus on some of the upcoming data in the week ahead, particularly CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for December on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Core CPI is expected to increase by 0.2%, putting the annual pace at 2.3%, and retail sales are expected to rise by 0.3%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe holiday season when all was said and done should have been pretty good. You had low gas prices, rising wages and a super tight labor market. It has to be good,\u201d said Joseph LaVorgna, Natixis chief economist Americas.\n*****\n&gt; There is also a parade of Fed speakers in the coming week, but they are unlikely to offer any clues about when the Fed will move off the sidelines. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who voted against the Fed\u2019s rate cuts three times last year, speaks Monday. There are a half dozen more appearances by other Fed officials, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, who speaks Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; LaVorgna said the Fed could begin to focus more on the rapid rise in the stock markets, as Kaplan did this past week. \u201cIt seems to me the hawks might worry about financial instability and the market being excessively exuberant,\u201d said LaVorgna.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CmRDJ3H.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HlaBE2S.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/Mo3s1ZX.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/4GkiL8Z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wA851N3.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nbY9KQS.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vGlTvp3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2v0Lf7h.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zi8Gzi5.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lm2IGKk.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YDrQkZN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VzMB0Wn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/V8ea808.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/HXQ4K2F.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Expiration Week: Mixed Bag Last 21 Years\n\n&gt; Over the past thirty-seven years, since 1983, the S&amp;P 500\u2019s performance during January\u2019s option expiration week has been a tepid. Friday has been up 21 and down 16, and the entire week has been down five-plus times for every four times it has been up. However, in the past twenty-one years (1999-2019), the S&amp;P 500\u2019s performance has taken a turn for the worse with expiration day falling ten times with an average loss of .08% and the full-week declining 14 times with an average loss of 0.74%.

DJIA advanced 22.3%, S&amp;P 500 climbed 28.9% and NASDAQ jumped 35.2% in 2019. Even for a pre-election year, those gains are above average. Gains of this magnitude also have a tendency to cause some uneasiness as valuations are generally getting stretched and thoughts turn to profit taking or the possibility of a pullback or a correction.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P 500 completed its last correction (defined as a 10% or greater decline, but less than 20% because that would be a bear market then) on December 24, 2018 after falling 19.8%. That was 378 calendar days ago and it was the fifth correction of the current bull market that begun on March 9, 2009. Since 1948, the current bull market is the second longest in duration and magnitude. The longest was 4494 calendar days from December 4, 1987 through March 24, 2000. S&amp;P 500 gained 582.1% during that bull while enduring five corrections. Even though it has been 378 days since the last does not mean one is imminent. S&amp;P 500 has gone as along as 2553 calendar days without a correction before (October 1990 through October 1997).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5fbda173e8dc370504a0f606427f62e1/ed8a77a7fe8ca133-e0/s540x810/8954d23b3dc93b4653c4fbb6e79bc909488fdeec.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Stocks Do During Geopolitical Events\n\n&gt; It was a volatile night for the U.S.-Iran conflict.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P 500 Index futures dipped 1.5% and global markets swung after Iran shot several ballistic missiles at U.S.-Iraqi military bases. Markets recovered their losses overnight on news that there were no American casualties, but tensions remain high in the Middle East.\n\n&gt; As concerns over the Iran conflict continue to build, we\u2019ve received many questions asking what this could mean for the market outlook. We discussed our initial thoughts regarding the conflict in our January 6 blog, but we believe it is important for investors to remember that there have been many times historically when stocks stood strong in times of conflict. In fact, the best ever annual Dow Jones Industrial Average gain was in 1915 during World War I.\n\n&gt; \u201cNo doubt worries over Iran have investors on edge,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cStocks could be volatile for a while, but the impact to stocks from geopolitical events historically has tended to be short-lived.\u201d\n\n&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 fell 5% on average in 20 major geopolitical events dating back to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. However, the S&amp;P 500 recovered those losses in fewer than 50 calendar days on average.\n\n&gt; A special thanks to Sam Stovall of CFRA for sharing the data below with LPL Research.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/geopolitical-events-and-stock-market-reactions.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The First Five Days Of 2020 Could Have Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; The first five days of 2020 are in the books. Although the headlines have been quite scary, equities have picked up right where they left off last year. In fact, after the first five trading days of the new year, the S&amp;SP 500 Index is up a respectable 0.65%.\n\n&gt; Jeffrey Hirsch of The Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac follows and tracks many interesting seasonal patterns. One that we find very interesting states that how stocks perform the first five trading days of a new year could indicate how the full year will go. Now, we\u2019ll be the first to admit no one should invest based only on this adage, but the results have been quite compelling.\n\n&gt; We did some research and found that when S&amp;P 500 returns in the first five trading days of a new year have been higher, the full-year total return for the S&amp;P 500 has been positive 80% of the time. Compare that to returns being up only 60% of the time when the first five days have been lower, and we have something that has our attention. What about big gains? Well, when those first five days have been up more than 2%, the full year return has been positive a very impressive 16 of 17 times! Only 2018 didn\u2019t follow suit when the first five days were up 2% or more.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/do-the-first-5-days-of-a-new-year-matter.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cShould you ever invest for a full year purely because of the first five days? We would emphatically say no,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut put in context, this seemingly random bit of info does have a very impressive track record. It is only a small piece of the pie, but the good news is we still don\u2019t see any major warning signs that this bull market is over just yet.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when the S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 0.65% the first five trading days of a new year\u2014like 2020\u2014the full year has finished in the green 31 out of 35 times, with a very solid 17.2% average annual return. Although we aren\u2019t expecting gains quite that large in 2020, it does help support the case for the bull for at least the rest of this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-first-five-days-of-2020-could-have-bulls-smiling.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# \"Take my crude, please\"\n\n&gt; Crude oil is just about as popular or maybe even less popular than tobacco these days. Sure, there was a brief spike in prices following the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani last Thursday night, but ever since then, crude oil has done nothing but trade lower. Just the fact that crude only managed to rally 3% in the lead up to what many thought to be a full-blown war with Iran shows just how out of favor crude is. This isn't the first time crude hasn't been able to hold onto gains either. As noted earlier this week, besides the last week, there have been two other periods of heightened tensions between the US and Iran over the last year where one would have expected prices to rally, but instead they sold-off.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-Crude-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; When a stock consistently opens at one price and then closes lower than it opened, it's considered a negative as it signals that investors are selling into strength. Applying that logic to crude oil confirms just how out of favor it has become. This week alone, the daily closing price has been lower than its open on all five days. The chart below shows daily streaks where crude oil closed below its opening price going back to the start of 2009. While the current five-day streak isn't anything to write home about, we would note that even before this past week's tensions in the Middle East, in late September/early October there was a streak of 13 trading days where the commodity closed lower than it opened, and that was the longest losing streak since at least the early 1980s! Before that, there was another streak of 7 trading days in July. In other words, two of the five longest streaks since 2009 where crude oil closed below its open both occurred in the last six months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-WTI-Declines.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dow 29,000?\n\n&gt; By posting this, we're probably jinxing it, but the DJIA is on the verge of topping another 1,000 point threshold less than two months after first topping 28,000. While the media makes a big deal of each of these thresholds, we would note that the road to 29,000 from 28,000 is only 3.4%. That's hardly a momentous move. Since Trump became President in January 2017, though, 29,000 would be the 10th 1,000-point threshold that the DJIA would cross under his watch.\n\n&gt; The table below lists the date that the DJIA first crossed each 1,000-point threshold throughout history. For each level, we also include the number of calendar days that elapsed between the first cross of that threshold and the prior one, how large a percentage gain that the 1000-point threshold represents versus the prior one, and then how many times the DJIA has crossed each threshold (on a closing basis) both to the upside and downside. One of the most notable aspects of the table in our view is that even though each threshold is a smaller percentage than the prior one, there have been so few crosses (above and below) of most of the thresholds since the Dow first crossed 19,000 after the 2016 election. 19,000 was only crossed once, and six of the other nine thresholds since then haven't been crossed more than ten times. That's indicative of a market that has been rallying and not looking back.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-DJIA-29000.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 10th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$JPM** \n&gt; * **$APHA** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$C** \n&gt; * **$WFC** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GS** \n&gt; * **$BLK** \n&gt; * **$PNC** \n&gt; * **$FRC** \n&gt; * **$USB** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$PPG** \n&gt; * **$FAST** \n&gt; * **$WIT** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$KSU** \n&gt; * **$TSM** \n&gt; * **$WNS** \n&gt; * **$SJR** \n&gt; * **$AA** \n&gt; * **$BK** \n&gt; * **$CSX** \n&gt; * **$MS** \n&gt; * **$JBHT** \n&gt; * **$HOMB** \n&gt; * **$SCHW** \n&gt; * **$RF** \n&gt; * **$OGI** \n&gt; * **$STT** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CFG** \n&gt; * **$HWC** \n&gt; * **$WAFD** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$EGBN** \n&gt; * **$OZK** \n&gt; * **$BEDU** \n&gt; * **$PBCT** \n&gt; * **$FHN** \n&gt; * **$INDB** \n&gt; * **$VOLT** \n&gt; * **$BMTC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zi8Gzi5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/2sH0ItO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/acnOb3c.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e3hO4am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/duE2t8W.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I9iQ8f1.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pQtl1r8.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lXhI0YM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jpODGmg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NYyWxgm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJ8xHj2.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nsBUIFM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.17.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. $136.07\n&gt; **JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

But details of that deal have never been made clear, so markets will be focused on any information that will clarify how it will be implemented and what checks and balances there are to ensure compliance.\n*****\n&gt; The market has also reached a lofty premium that could be challenged if earnings disappoint, though analysts widely expect to see the majority of companies able to beat lowered expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Banks are first up with J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo releasing earnings Tuesday, and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs reporting on Wednesday. Earnings could be a slight positive for the market, analysts say.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think earnings are going to be a good component,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cCompanies have lowered the bar enough to where I think most of the companies will easily step over it, and we\u2019ll all have a sigh of relief that the earnings this quarter won\u2019t be as bad as it could have been. It won\u2019 be strong. We\u2019ve seen revisions across all of the sectors come down.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; According to Refinitiv, fourth quarter earnings are expected to be down 0.6%, based on results of companies that have already reported and estimates for others that have not.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks started out the past week worried about a blowup in the Middle East, after the U.S. killed Iran\u2019s top general. But by midweek, tensions dissipated and stocks were higher. On Friday, stocks sold off again, after a lackluster jobs report, though the Dow briefly topped 29,000 for the first time. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.9% for the week, at 3,265, and the Dow was off 0.7% at 28,823.\n*****\n&gt; The China trade deal is expected to be signed on Wednesday, and while it may be a nonevent, it has the potential for surprises. The deal most likely will be seen as a positive, but it is not expected to do much to curb technology transfers, which are expected to be part of the next phase discussions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf the deal is more watered down than anticipated, if there\u2019s skepticism about how China will adhere to its promises\u201d it could be negative, Arone said. \u201cThere\u2019s skepticism already. If there\u2019s something in the details that suggest doubt about how are we going to police this or how are we going to enforce this, I think that could cause markets to move some.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group said he thinks the market has moved past the trade news. \u201cI think they\u2019ll try to emphasize some IP protection. I honestly think people have already moved on,\u201d he said. President Donald Trump has also lowered expectations by noting that the next phase of the deal would not come until after the election.\n*****\n&gt;# Economy\n&gt; Markets also will focus on some of the upcoming data in the week ahead, particularly CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for December on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Core CPI is expected to increase by 0.2%, putting the annual pace at 2.3%, and retail sales are expected to rise by 0.3%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe holiday season when all was said and done should have been pretty good. You had low gas prices, rising wages and a super tight labor market. It has to be good,\u201d said Joseph LaVorgna, Natixis chief economist Americas.\n*****\n&gt; There is also a parade of Fed speakers in the coming week, but they are unlikely to offer any clues about when the Fed will move off the sidelines. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who voted against the Fed\u2019s rate cuts three times last year, speaks Monday. There are a half dozen more appearances by other Fed officials, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, who speaks Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; LaVorgna said the Fed could begin to focus more on the rapid rise in the stock markets, as Kaplan did this past week. \u201cIt seems to me the hawks might worry about financial instability and the market being excessively exuberant,\u201d said LaVorgna.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CmRDJ3H.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HlaBE2S.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/Mo3s1ZX.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/4GkiL8Z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wA851N3.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nbY9KQS.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vGlTvp3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2v0Lf7h.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zi8Gzi5.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lm2IGKk.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YDrQkZN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VzMB0Wn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/V8ea808.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/HXQ4K2F.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Expiration Week: Mixed Bag Last 21 Years\n\n&gt; Over the past thirty-seven years, since 1983, the S&amp;P 500\u2019s performance during January\u2019s option expiration week has been a tepid. Friday has been up 21 and down 16, and the entire week has been down five-plus times for every four times it has been up. However, in the past twenty-one years (1999-2019), the S&amp;P 500\u2019s performance has taken a turn for the worse with expiration day falling ten times with an average loss of .08% and the full-week declining 14 times with an average loss of 0.74%.

DJIA advanced 22.3%, S&amp;P 500 climbed 28.9% and NASDAQ jumped 35.2% in 2019. Even for a pre-election year, those gains are above average. Gains of this magnitude also have a tendency to cause some uneasiness as valuations are generally getting stretched and thoughts turn to profit taking or the possibility of a pullback or a correction.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P 500 completed its last correction (defined as a 10% or greater decline, but less than 20% because that would be a bear market then) on December 24, 2018 after falling 19.8%. That was 378 calendar days ago and it was the fifth correction of the current bull market that begun on March 9, 2009. Since 1948, the current bull market is the second longest in duration and magnitude. The longest was 4494 calendar days from December 4, 1987 through March 24, 2000. S&amp;P 500 gained 582.1% during that bull while enduring five corrections. Even though it has been 378 days since the last does not mean one is imminent. S&amp;P 500 has gone as along as 2553 calendar days without a correction before (October 1990 through October 1997).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5fbda173e8dc370504a0f606427f62e1/ed8a77a7fe8ca133-e0/s540x810/8954d23b3dc93b4653c4fbb6e79bc909488fdeec.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Stocks Do During Geopolitical Events\n\n&gt; It was a volatile night for the U.S.-Iran conflict.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P 500 Index futures dipped 1.5% and global markets swung after Iran shot several ballistic missiles at U.S.-Iraqi military bases. Markets recovered their losses overnight on news that there were no American casualties, but tensions remain high in the Middle East.\n\n&gt; As concerns over the Iran conflict continue to build, we\u2019ve received many questions asking what this could mean for the market outlook. We discussed our initial thoughts regarding the conflict in our January 6 blog, but we believe it is important for investors to remember that there have been many times historically when stocks stood strong in times of conflict. In fact, the best ever annual Dow Jones Industrial Average gain was in 1915 during World War I.\n\n&gt; \u201cNo doubt worries over Iran have investors on edge,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cStocks could be volatile for a while, but the impact to stocks from geopolitical events historically has tended to be short-lived.\u201d\n\n&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 fell 5% on average in 20 major geopolitical events dating back to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. However, the S&amp;P 500 recovered those losses in fewer than 50 calendar days on average.\n\n&gt; A special thanks to Sam Stovall of CFRA for sharing the data below with LPL Research.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/geopolitical-events-and-stock-market-reactions.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The First Five Days Of 2020 Could Have Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; The first five days of 2020 are in the books. Although the headlines have been quite scary, equities have picked up right where they left off last year. In fact, after the first five trading days of the new year, the S&amp;SP 500 Index is up a respectable 0.65%.\n\n&gt; Jeffrey Hirsch of The Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac follows and tracks many interesting seasonal patterns. One that we find very interesting states that how stocks perform the first five trading days of a new year could indicate how the full year will go. Now, we\u2019ll be the first to admit no one should invest based only on this adage, but the results have been quite compelling.\n\n&gt; We did some research and found that when S&amp;P 500 returns in the first five trading days of a new year have been higher, the full-year total return for the S&amp;P 500 has been positive 80% of the time. Compare that to returns being up only 60% of the time when the first five days have been lower, and we have something that has our attention. What about big gains? Well, when those first five days have been up more than 2%, the full year return has been positive a very impressive 16 of 17 times! Only 2018 didn\u2019t follow suit when the first five days were up 2% or more.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/do-the-first-5-days-of-a-new-year-matter.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cShould you ever invest for a full year purely because of the first five days? We would emphatically say no,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut put in context, this seemingly random bit of info does have a very impressive track record. It is only a small piece of the pie, but the good news is we still don\u2019t see any major warning signs that this bull market is over just yet.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when the S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 0.65% the first five trading days of a new year\u2014like 2020\u2014the full year has finished in the green 31 out of 35 times, with a very solid 17.2% average annual return. Although we aren\u2019t expecting gains quite that large in 2020, it does help support the case for the bull for at least the rest of this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-first-five-days-of-2020-could-have-bulls-smiling.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# \"Take my crude, please\"\n\n&gt; Crude oil is just about as popular or maybe even less popular than tobacco these days. Sure, there was a brief spike in prices following the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani last Thursday night, but ever since then, crude oil has done nothing but trade lower. Just the fact that crude only managed to rally 3% in the lead up to what many thought to be a full-blown war with Iran shows just how out of favor crude is. This isn't the first time crude hasn't been able to hold onto gains either. As noted earlier this week, besides the last week, there have been two other periods of heightened tensions between the US and Iran over the last year where one would have expected prices to rally, but instead they sold-off.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-Crude-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; When a stock consistently opens at one price and then closes lower than it opened, it's considered a negative as it signals that investors are selling into strength. Applying that logic to crude oil confirms just how out of favor it has become. This week alone, the daily closing price has been lower than its open on all five days. The chart below shows daily streaks where crude oil closed below its opening price going back to the start of 2009. While the current five-day streak isn't anything to write home about, we would note that even before this past week's tensions in the Middle East, in late September/early October there was a streak of 13 trading days where the commodity closed lower than it opened, and that was the longest losing streak since at least the early 1980s! Before that, there was another streak of 7 trading days in July. In other words, two of the five longest streaks since 2009 where crude oil closed below its open both occurred in the last six months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-WTI-Declines.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dow 29,000?\n\n&gt; By posting this, we're probably jinxing it, but the DJIA is on the verge of topping another 1,000 point threshold less than two months after first topping 28,000. While the media makes a big deal of each of these thresholds, we would note that the road to 29,000 from 28,000 is only 3.4%. That's hardly a momentous move. Since Trump became President in January 2017, though, 29,000 would be the 10th 1,000-point threshold that the DJIA would cross under his watch.\n\n&gt; The table below lists the date that the DJIA first crossed each 1,000-point threshold throughout history. For each level, we also include the number of calendar days that elapsed between the first cross of that threshold and the prior one, how large a percentage gain that the 1000-point threshold represents versus the prior one, and then how many times the DJIA has crossed each threshold (on a closing basis) both to the upside and downside. One of the most notable aspects of the table in our view is that even though each threshold is a smaller percentage than the prior one, there have been so few crosses (above and below) of most of the thresholds since the Dow first crossed 19,000 after the 2016 election. 19,000 was only crossed once, and six of the other nine thresholds since then haven't been crossed more than ten times. That's indicative of a market that has been rallying and not looking back.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-DJIA-29000.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 10th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$JPM** \n&gt; * **$APHA** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$C** \n&gt; * **$WFC** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GS** \n&gt; * **$BLK** \n&gt; * **$PNC** \n&gt; * **$FRC** \n&gt; * **$USB** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$PPG** \n&gt; * **$FAST** \n&gt; * **$WIT** \n&gt; * **$LMNR** \n&gt; * **$KSU** \n&gt; * **$TSM** \n&gt; * **$WNS** \n&gt; * **$SJR** \n&gt; * **$AA** \n&gt; * **$BK** \n&gt; * **$CSX** \n&gt; * **$MS** \n&gt; * **$JBHT** \n&gt; * **$HOMB** \n&gt; * **$SCHW** \n&gt; * **$RF** \n&gt; * **$OGI** \n&gt; * **$STT** \n&gt; * **$BBCP** \n&gt; * **$CFG** \n&gt; * **$HWC** \n&gt; * **$WAFD** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$EGBN** \n&gt; * **$OZK** \n&gt; * **$BEDU** \n&gt; * **$PBCT** \n&gt; * **$FHN** \n&gt; * **$INDB** \n&gt; * **$VOLT** \n&gt; * **$BMTC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zi8Gzi5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/2sH0ItO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/acnOb3c.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e3hO4am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/duE2t8W.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I9iQ8f1.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pQtl1r8.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lXhI0YM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jpODGmg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NYyWxgm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJ8xHj2.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nsBUIFM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.17.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. $136.07\n&gt; **JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.
