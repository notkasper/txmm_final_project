It got hit just like FSLY and NET during the big sell off in early September. Since then, its bounced back 20% from a low of $5 back up to the $6 range. This stock is highly volatile, moving between gains of 80% to losses of 40% in the past 3 months. Its volatility seems tied to macro factors affecting perceived continued work-from-home.\n\nThe investor presentation for Q3 are here: https://s24.q4cdn.com/772370104/files/doc_presentations/Limelight_Networks_Investor_Presentation_Analyst_Day_July2020.pdf\n\nThe important things I was able to glean from this is their current mktcap and perceived growth. Their current mktcap is around $700M with a stock price of $6. They look like they have a really solid floor at $5, but a ceiling at $7-ish.\n\nTheir Q3 numbers weren't particularly spectacular: https://s24.q4cdn.com/772370104/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/Q2-2020-Financial-Schedule.pdf\n\nWhat does stand out is their gross profit is around 40%. Which seems low compared to other CDNs. For example, Cloudflare's gross margin is 77%: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200507005955/en/Cloudflare-Announces-First-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results\n\nI've seen posts on /r/stocks saying that LLNW is undervalued. And the graph that LLNW posts on their investor relations deck (data from 2019) has then low in revenue multiple per growth category. Which is good because they haven't run up yet comparatively.\n\nAgain, their revenue target for the year is about $232M, compared to $200M for all of 2019. Thats about a growth rate of 15%. But given their market cap is only $700M, thats a revenue to market cap multiplier of only ~3.02.\n\nI know its not apples to apples since Fastly is more of a hosting specialization company focusing on ease of use, but FSLY has revenue projections of $260M for 2020 (I got this number by taking their Q2 results and doubling it: https://investors.fastly.com/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/2Q20-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) and is trading at market cap of 9.5B. The big difference is that FSLY operates are revenue margins of 58%. FSLY is also seeing growth of 50% YoY.\n\nSo LLNW definitely has headwinds in this market. They have lower gross margin and lower growth rates compared to the other hype company in this market.\n\nDoes anyone have insight into whether LLNW is a worthwhile investment that can overcome these two factors that seem to govern stock price of these cloud hosting companies?", true, false, false, "stocks", "t5_2qjfk", 854396, "public", "self", "LLNW growth rate and gross profit projections, and benefits from 2nd COVID wave bump", 0, [], 1.0, "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ix4v9g/llnw_growth_rate_and_gross_profit_projections_and/", "all_ads", 6, 1600705463.0, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "radarbot", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_13xxx6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1600709063, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ix4v9g/llnw_growth_rate_and_gross_profit_projections_and/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ix4v9g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "tickerdiscussion", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "612ee368-65e6-11e5-b53f-129e4297eb59", "link_flair_text": "Ticker Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/ix4v9g/llnw_growth_rate_and_gross_profit_projections_and/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1600709075, "score": 1, "selftext": "LLNW is up 20% since its bottom on September 9.

Which is good because they haven't run up yet comparatively.\n\nAgain, their revenue target for the year is about $232M, compared to $200M for all of 2019. Thats about a growth rate of 15%. But given their market cap is only $700M, thats a revenue to market cap multiplier of only ~3.02.\n\nI know its not apples to apples since Fastly is more of a hosting specialization company focusing on ease of use, but FSLY has revenue projections of $260M for 2020 (I got this number by taking their Q2 results and doubling it: https://investors.fastly.com/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/2Q20-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) and is trading at market cap of 9.5B. The big difference is that FSLY operates are revenue margins of 58%. FSLY is also seeing growth of 50% YoY.\n\nSo LLNW definitely has headwinds in this market. They have lower gross margin and lower growth rates compared to the other hype company in this market.\n\nDoes anyone have insight into whether LLNW is a worthwhile investment that can overcome these two factors that seem to govern stock price of these cloud hosting companies?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 854396, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "LLNW growth rate and gross profit projections, and benefits from 2nd COVID wave bump", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ix4v9g/llnw_growth_rate_and_gross_profit_projections_and/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1600705463.0}], [[], false, "bumblebear3012", null, [], null, "text", "t2_58xjt861", false, false, [], false, false, 1596482526, "self.stocks", "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i33kxb/fastly_vs_cloudflare_the_preearnings_rundown/", {}, "i33kxb", true, false, false, false, true, true, false, "", [], "dark", "text", false, false, true, 159, 0, false, "all_ads", "/r/stocks/comments/i33kxb/fastly_vs_cloudflare_the_preearnings_rundown/", false, 6, 1596482537, 1, "In a recent post I did on AMD, some had expressed interest in a write-up on Cloudflare. I wasn\u2019t going to write anything since I am long NET, but then I saw Fastly up around 13% today ahead of its earnings on Wednesday. With both Cloudflare and Fastly reporting this week, I thought the timing was apt to compare these two as they\u2019ve pursued different approaches to building their networks. And I happen to believe that while Fastly\u2019s heavy focus on speed/performance does offer some advantages in the CDN market, the real opportunity in these names (as well as Akamai for that matter) is the edge computing market \u2013 not CDN.\n\nI think one of the major reasons why Fastly is up over 430% YTD and Cloudflare over 145% is because most analysts were slow to pick up on the full extent of the end market(s) these companies are exposed to. I also think there has been some conflation in terms of the technology. Even now, I see CDN and edge computing used interchangeably when they are not necessarily the same. While similar ideas in that they both leverage edge servers (servers placed at a closer geographical proximity to the end-user or device), the use-case is not necessarily the same. Think of a CDN more so as a particular application or use of edge computing. To this point, multiple CDN players (Akamai, LimeLight, CDNetworks) have made recent moves into the broader edge computing market. \n\nBroader is the keyword here, because whereas CDNs cache web content (videos, photos, etc. from a website to speed its \u201cdelivery\u201d to the site\u2019s visitor), the hype surrounding edge computing is more so tied to 5G and the Internet-of-Things rather than primarily websites or SaaS applications necessarily. To be more specific, the value proposition of IoT is the vast distribution of sensors and real-time *collection* of data. Positioning edge networks closer to the IoT devices can enable faster industrial or logistics solutions.\n\nThose familiar with Fastly will be aware that they offer (or offered) the fastest cold start times (this just means the time it takes for an application to start up and be responsive to user input) of any serverless network application (CDN or edge) at 35 microseconds. Fastly claims that they are the gold standard for speed and performance and superior to AWS, Azure, Google, and Cloudflare. This approach has been successful, especially in targeting large enterprise customers. Fastly has a much larger average customer size relative to Cloudflare. \n\nWhile Fastly has recently expanded their security offerings as they further develop their edge platform, Cloudflare's strategy from the onset has been to balance performance, speed, and flexibility. Why does this matter? The major drawback to edge computing is that it greatly increases attack vectors for network intrusion. 5G will enable an extremely rapid proliferation of IoT devices. According to the Telecommunications Industry Association, by 2022, more than half of all internet-connected devices will by IoT machines. And IoT device operators will absolutely prioritize security of their industrial and logistics applications, especially as most computing applications (websites, programs, etc.), are not really as sensitive to latency at the speeds we are talking \u2013 i.e. the user/operator can\u2019t actually discern the speed difference on their end. \n\nIoT operators (industrial, logistics, transportation companies) won\u2019t be focused on consumers doing e-commerce or going on Reddit. They will be collecting zettabytes of structured and unstructured data to *push upstream* so that they can manage their assets more efficiently and securely. Fastly\u2019s network utilizes fewer servers to increase efficiency and speed. Although that is great for Twitter, this lowers the network capacity to mitigate DDoS attacks (the most common IoT attack). Cloudflare has more points-of-presence and network capacity versus Fastly. This combined with their more expansive attack logs (Cloudflare services a far greater number of web properties than Fastly) and more mature security product portfolio, gives their network architecture numerous advantages for the edge computing market. This is all ignoring the fact that Cloudflare announced last week *zero nanosecond* cold start times for its edge computing platform which totally undercuts the Fastly speed advantage anyway. \n\nThe CDN market is larger today. Prior to COVID and the work-from-home demand boost, estimates tagged it at around $13.3bn. In comparison, the edge computing market was only $3.5bn in 2019 according to Grand View Research. Looking towards the future though? The CDN market is forecasted to hit $23bn plus by 2025, while the edge computing market is seen hitting $43bn or more in 2027. There have been recent reports that suggest the rise in the edge computing market over the next 10 years could even rival the growth in public cloud over the previous ten years (led by Amazon, Microsoft, Google). And Gartner believes that by 2025, three-quarters of enterprise-generated data will be created and processed at the edge. If you stop and think how much data has been created in 2020 versus just a few years ago, that is truly staggering growth. \n\nThe above comments gloss over the fact that there are also some very real reasons why a CTO or purchaser would select Cloudflare as a CDN over Fastly. The other big advantage Fastly has over Cloudflare (and Akamai) is it is *much* more customizable for developers. For web applications that are very high-level enterprise grade or extremely sensitive to latency, it absolutely makes sense to go with Fastly. However not all use-cases for a CDN require that level of customization, and there is quite the vertical learning curve for developers to learn the Fastly platform. Cloudflare also has more flexible pricing tiers (including a free tier) for customers who may not need the premium features. In short, there is a much wider range of use-cases that Cloudflare can cater to with its CDN platform relative to Fastly. I think this is evidenced by the fact that Cloudflare has far more customers (number not size) in addition to a much bigger developer community on Stackflow. \n\nThis all gives Cloudflare more potential to scale with its CDN customers and cross-sell its more diverse product portfolio. Again, Fastly certainly has a very strong presence in the large enterprise market. And for many, the performance and customization offered by Fastly will be a decisive factor when it comes to which CDN provider to choose. But I do think that Fastly has very much built itself to be the premium provider when a lot of customers are totally happy with a marginally slower cold start time if it means more flexibility on cost or ease-of-use.\n\nAt the end of the day, what this boils down to is which end market are you more bullish on: CDN or edge computing. For the record, I think over the next five years Fastly has a great opportunity to keep up the momentum. Its performance YTD would scare me a little bit in the immediate term because I think these levels assume continued growth acceleration or more guidance raises. But the CDN market is projected to keep growing at a healthy clip. And like I said, there are definitely some clear use cases for Fastly. \n\nI just happen to think that Cloudflare has a much, much, much higher long-term ceiling (thinking next 10-15 years) when you look at its natural advantages in the edge computing space and the enormous potential of that end market. Also of note, Cloudflare is slated to nearly double its global data center footprint over the next 3 years through its joint venture in China with JD.com. And whatever you think of China, its undeniable that there will be a data explosion there as internet penetration goes from the low 60% it is today to someday rival western countries. \n\nFastly is interesting, but when you look at the fact that Cloudflare has 77% gross margins compared to 57% for Fastly, you are ultimately paying a higher EV/revenue for slower growth, fewer revenues, one-fifth the cash, and significantly weaker margins.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

This, on top of its rapidly growing developer platform, is consequential for many reasons as a market-mover in the industry.`\n\n`# In Short`\n\n`CloudFlare so far has been shredding forward across multiple technical markets competing against by:`\n\n`- Competing marketshare against CISCO, Palo Alto Networks, and other hardware customers`\n\n`- Offering a way to not lock your organization into a big tech vendor`\n\n`- Promoting security and challenging Big Tech's direction with web development`\n\n`- Forming positive relationships with Shopify, Facebook, JD, Twitter, Baidu, TOR, and Microsoft`\n\n`- Pioneering the ease-of-use privacy movement with` [`1.1.1.1`](https://1.1.1.1/) `and distributing VPNs.`\n\n`- Growing a rapid, robust, cost-effective, and secure network across the world`\n\n`- _Providing a development platform that promotes the use extremely powerful and 'cutting edge' web computing._ **-&gt; YOU ARE HERE**`\n\n`- Creating a better internet.`\n\n`_**Cofounder of NPM - a primary pioneer in the cloud market**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951310-7164c400-a7e5-11ea-8675-e265e7c15336.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951310-7164c400-a7e5-11ea-8675-e265e7c15336.png)`)`\n\n`# The Thesis`\n\n`The economic value and convergence between e-commerce, global networking speeds, and video advancements is not anywhere close to realized. There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall economic development cycle. This timeframe has been accelerated greatly due to global market lockdowns and further risk of lockdown.`\n\n`Physical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world. Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950869-9c99e400-a7e2-11ea-8373-3e6f2b42b4bc.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950869-9c99e400-a7e2-11ea-8373-3e6f2b42b4bc.png)`)`\n\n`Infrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates. This market is **BIG** and no one or two players will be large enough to capture the market. It ranges from manufacturers, energy departments, web products, hospitals, governments, and so on. Security is serviced differently based on the industry. This much is obvious - a hospital will clearly protect patient records more closely than a manufacturer controlling the runtime of their high-speed machining assembly line.`\n\n`_**ZScaler servicing manufacturing, IT, and industrial operations**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950190-a5d48200-a7dd-11ea-8208-567a6345c005.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950190-a5d48200-a7dd-11ea-8208-567a6345c005.png)`)`\n\n`_**CloudFlare prioritizing hospital security over web retailers**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950400-6e66d500-a7df-11ea-8814-212983bade56.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950400-6e66d500-a7df-11ea-8814-212983bade56.png)`)`\n\n`_**Amazon &amp;&amp; Facebook angling for web retailers over hospitals**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950431-a66e1800-a7df-11ea-933e-1ac98bda30e8.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950431-a66e1800-a7df-11ea-933e-1ac98bda30e8.png)`)`\n\n`_**Fastly executes on video and media delivery**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950653-45474400-a7e1-11ea-9e73-bdf121115612.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950653-45474400-a7e1-11ea-9e73-bdf121115612.png)`)`\n\n`The need for secure video, transactions, VR, and user experiences will be dramatically shot up and this is evident across many exciting technologies like Apple VR, Google Gaming, Square Banking, Facebook Shops with VR shopping, Microsoft software automations, and government developments.`\n\n`NET is one of the best positioned companies to pioneer this market at scale.`\n\n`# Market drivers &amp; a brief history of modern computing`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951016-9bb58200-a7e3-11ea-8398-151ec1df2bae.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951016-9bb58200-a7e3-11ea-8398-151ec1df2bae.png)`)`\n\n`The history of CDNs took a much larger turn when YouTube and Netflix became big players in data production and needed to cooperate with Internet Service Providers to manage the new dam and tunnels of water that the market had created.`\n\n`As many of you know, video data is large and streaming high quality videos at high speed to millions of users in real time was no laughing matter. Around this time you also began to see new products in ESports like` [`Twitch.tv`](https://twitch.tv/) `which would \"stream\" video.`\n\n`What had happened was that tech companies discovered a more cost effective way of delivering video and it was through controlling the actual pipeline. You would receive atomized content as needed rather than waiting for blocks of video to be received on your end (this was problematic in early Youtube days with broadband and DSL)`\n\n`The paradigm began to shift. Cloud computing and asynchronous models began to gain steam in the developer profession. We began a defining chapter of web optimizations that still continue today with serverless computing, real-time data, and growing user-experiences. At this time you began to notice that you no longer had to refresh your web page to receive new data. Remember when Facebook started to notify you rather than you checking your notifications? Do you remember when you had to check your email?`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951531-e1c01500-a7e6-11ea-87c0-f7bcdf9e6ffd.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951531-e1c01500-a7e6-11ea-87c0-f7bcdf9e6ffd.png)`)`\n\n`Today, developers are able to create or distribute product and services using networking and data center functions. This is largely what is recognized as cloud and serverless computing. This is has many consequences but primarily allows for unbelievably fast responses and avenues for user experiences.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951289-5003d800-a7e5-11ea-9aaf-c5b44063a66e.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951289-5003d800-a7e5-11ea-9aaf-c5b44063a66e.png)`)`\n\n`# What is serverless computing?`\n\n`Serverless computing allows a 25 year old developer like me run 5 different businesses on my dinky little Macintosh while I let Google and Cloudflare run my servers under an extremely cheap pricing model. That is a revolutionary change for software. It is one of the bread and butter of SaaS, IaaS, and other cloud style businesses where many business problems come out of the box for you.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83955922-1941b800-a80d-11ea-8675-28c216be50eb.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83955922-1941b800-a80d-11ea-8675-28c216be50eb.png)`)`\n\n`# Other competitive advantages of network and cloud computing`\n\n`The reason Snapchat did not gain any traction outside of the US was because Facebook provided a fundamentally faster service across WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook's investment in Akamai and its personal networking infrastructure allowed them to create a product that was fast, cheap and would work in various rural or economic conditions. Snapchat never stood a chance in the global social media landscape as a result.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951349-b7218c80-a7e5-11ea-9901-abd22b1f776e.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951349-b7218c80-a7e5-11ea-9901-abd22b1f776e.png)`)`\n\n`# What's special about CloudFlare as a network?`\n\n`What CloudFlare specifically offers against its competitors is its **privacy-first approach** and its quality of engineering. CloudFlare is essentially a distributed private content delivery network (pCDN) with a massive infrastructure effort to send data around the world safely and cheaply.`\n\n`This is fundamentally consequential as we are seeing massive nations tackle issues with how data can be utilized or privatized.`\n\n`Privacy and speed sells.

This, on top of its rapidly growing developer platform, is consequential for many reasons as a market-mover in the industry.`\n\n`# In Short`\n\n`CloudFlare so far has been shredding forward across multiple technical markets competing against by:`\n\n`- Competing marketshare against CISCO, Palo Alto Networks, and other hardware customers`\n\n`- Offering a way to not lock your organization into a big tech vendor`\n\n`- Promoting security and challenging Big Tech's direction with web development`\n\n`- Forming positive relationships with Shopify, Facebook, JD, Twitter, Baidu, TOR, and Microsoft`\n\n`- Pioneering the ease-of-use privacy movement with` [`1.1.1.1`](https://1.1.1.1/) `and distributing VPNs.`\n\n`- Growing a rapid, robust, cost-effective, and secure network across the world`\n\n`- _Providing a development platform that promotes the use extremely powerful and 'cutting edge' web computing._ **-&gt; YOU ARE HERE**`\n\n`- Creating a better internet.`\n\n`_**Cofounder of NPM - a primary pioneer in the cloud market**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951310-7164c400-a7e5-11ea-8675-e265e7c15336.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951310-7164c400-a7e5-11ea-8675-e265e7c15336.png)`)`\n\n`# The Thesis`\n\n`The economic value and convergence between e-commerce, global networking speeds, and video advancements is not anywhere close to realized. There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall economic development cycle. This timeframe has been accelerated greatly due to global market lockdowns and further risk of lockdown.`\n\n`Physical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world. Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950869-9c99e400-a7e2-11ea-8373-3e6f2b42b4bc.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950869-9c99e400-a7e2-11ea-8373-3e6f2b42b4bc.png)`)`\n\n`Infrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates. This market is **BIG** and no one or two players will be large enough to capture the market. It ranges from manufacturers, energy departments, web products, hospitals, governments, and so on. Security is serviced differently based on the industry. This much is obvious - a hospital will clearly protect patient records more closely than a manufacturer controlling the runtime of their high-speed machining assembly line.`\n\n`_**ZScaler servicing manufacturing, IT, and industrial operations**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950190-a5d48200-a7dd-11ea-8208-567a6345c005.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950190-a5d48200-a7dd-11ea-8208-567a6345c005.png)`)`\n\n`_**CloudFlare prioritizing hospital security over web retailers**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950400-6e66d500-a7df-11ea-8814-212983bade56.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950400-6e66d500-a7df-11ea-8814-212983bade56.png)`)`\n\n`_**Amazon &amp;&amp; Facebook angling for web retailers over hospitals**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950431-a66e1800-a7df-11ea-933e-1ac98bda30e8.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950431-a66e1800-a7df-11ea-933e-1ac98bda30e8.png)`)`\n\n`_**Fastly executes on video and media delivery**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950653-45474400-a7e1-11ea-9e73-bdf121115612.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950653-45474400-a7e1-11ea-9e73-bdf121115612.png)`)`\n\n`The need for secure video, transactions, VR, and user experiences will be dramatically shot up and this is evident across many exciting technologies like Apple VR, Google Gaming, Square Banking, Facebook Shops with VR shopping, Microsoft software automations, and government developments.`\n\n`NET is one of the best positioned companies to pioneer this market at scale.`\n\n`# Market drivers &amp; a brief history of modern computing`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951016-9bb58200-a7e3-11ea-8398-151ec1df2bae.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951016-9bb58200-a7e3-11ea-8398-151ec1df2bae.png)`)`\n\n`The history of CDNs took a much larger turn when YouTube and Netflix became big players in data production and needed to cooperate with Internet Service Providers to manage the new dam and tunnels of water that the market had created.`\n\n`As many of you know, video data is large and streaming high quality videos at high speed to millions of users in real time was no laughing matter. Around this time you also began to see new products in ESports like` [`Twitch.tv`](https://twitch.tv/) `which would \"stream\" video.`\n\n`What had happened was that tech companies discovered a more cost effective way of delivering video and it was through controlling the actual pipeline. You would receive atomized content as needed rather than waiting for blocks of video to be received on your end (this was problematic in early Youtube days with broadband and DSL)`\n\n`The paradigm began to shift. Cloud computing and asynchronous models began to gain steam in the developer profession. We began a defining chapter of web optimizations that still continue today with serverless computing, real-time data, and growing user-experiences. At this time you began to notice that you no longer had to refresh your web page to receive new data. Remember when Facebook started to notify you rather than you checking your notifications? Do you remember when you had to check your email?`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951531-e1c01500-a7e6-11ea-87c0-f7bcdf9e6ffd.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951531-e1c01500-a7e6-11ea-87c0-f7bcdf9e6ffd.png)`)`\n\n`Today, developers are able to create or distribute product and services using networking and data center functions. This is largely what is recognized as cloud and serverless computing. This is has many consequences but primarily allows for unbelievably fast responses and avenues for user experiences.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951289-5003d800-a7e5-11ea-9aaf-c5b44063a66e.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951289-5003d800-a7e5-11ea-9aaf-c5b44063a66e.png)`)`\n\n`# What is serverless computing?`\n\n`Serverless computing allows a 25 year old developer like me run 5 different businesses on my dinky little Macintosh while I let Google and Cloudflare run my servers under an extremely cheap pricing model. That is a revolutionary change for software. It is one of the bread and butter of SaaS, IaaS, and other cloud style businesses where many business problems come out of the box for you.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83955922-1941b800-a80d-11ea-8675-28c216be50eb.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83955922-1941b800-a80d-11ea-8675-28c216be50eb.png)`)`\n\n`# Other competitive advantages of network and cloud computing`\n\n`The reason Snapchat did not gain any traction outside of the US was because Facebook provided a fundamentally faster service across WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook's investment in Akamai and its personal networking infrastructure allowed them to create a product that was fast, cheap and would work in various rural or economic conditions. Snapchat never stood a chance in the global social media landscape as a result.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951349-b7218c80-a7e5-11ea-9901-abd22b1f776e.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951349-b7218c80-a7e5-11ea-9901-abd22b1f776e.png)`)`\n\n`# What's special about CloudFlare as a network?`\n\n`What CloudFlare specifically offers against its competitors is its **privacy-first approach** and its quality of engineering. CloudFlare is essentially a distributed private content delivery network (pCDN) with a massive infrastructure effort to send data around the world safely and cheaply.`\n\n`This is fundamentally consequential as we are seeing massive nations tackle issues with how data can be utilized or privatized.`\n\n`Privacy and speed sells.
